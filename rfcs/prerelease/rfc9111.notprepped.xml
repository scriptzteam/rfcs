         <t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level
   request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
   self-descriptive messages for flexible interaction with network-based
   hypertext information systems. It is typically used for distributed information systems, where
   the use of response caches can improve performance. This document
   defines aspects of HTTP related to caching and reusing response
   messages.
</t>
<iref item="cache"/>

         <t>
   An HTTP "cache" is a local store of response messages and the
   subsystem that controls storage, retrieval, and deletion of messages in it.
   A cache stores cacheable responses to reduce the response time and
   network bandwidth consumption on future equivalent requests. Any client or
   server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use a cache, though not when acting as a tunnel (<xref target="HTTP" section="3.7"/>).
</t>
         <iref item="shared cache"/>
         <iref item="private cache"/>
         <t anchor="shared.and.private.caches">
   A "shared cache" is a cache that stores responses for reuse
   by more than one user; shared caches are usually (but not always) deployed
   as a part of an intermediary. A "private cache", in contrast,
   is dedicated to a single user; often, they are deployed as a component of
   a user agent.
</t>
         <t>
   The goal of HTTP caching is significantly improving performance
   by reusing a prior response message to satisfy a current request.
   A cache considers a stored response "fresh", as defined in
   <xref target="expiration.model"/>, if it can be reused without
   "validation" (checking with the origin server to see if the cached response
   remains valid for this request).  A fresh response can therefore
   reduce both latency and network overhead each time the cache reuses it.
   When a cached response is not fresh, it might still be reusable if validation
   can freshen it (<xref target="validation.model"/>) or if the
   origin is unavailable (<xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).

       binary form; an implementation could produce it as a string if
       any overflow occurs, even if the calculations are performed with an
       arithmetic type incapable of directly representing that number.
       What matters here is that an overflow be detected and not treated as a 
       negative value in later calculations.

      <section anchor="caching.overview" title="Overview of Cache Operation">
         <iref item="cache key"/>
         <t>
   Proper cache operation preserves the semantics of HTTP transfers
   while reducing the transmission of information already held in the
   cache. See <xref target="HTTP" section="3"/>
   for the general terminology and core concepts of HTTP.
</t>
         <t>
   Although caching is an entirely <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> feature of HTTP, it can be
   assumed that reusing a cached response is desirable and that such reuse
   is the default behavior when no requirement or local configuration
   prevents it. Therefore, HTTP cache requirements are focused
   on preventing a cache from either storing a non-reusable response or
   reusing a stored response inappropriately, rather than mandating that
   caches always store and reuse particular responses.
</t>
         <iref item="cache key"/>
         <t>
   The "cache key" is the information a cache uses to choose a response and
   is composed from, at a minimum, the request method and target
   URI used to retrieve the stored response; the method determines under which
   circumstances that response can be used to satisfy a subsequent request. However, many
   HTTP caches in common use today only cache GET responses and therefore only
   use the URI as the cache key.
</t>
         <t>
   A cache might store multiple responses for a request target that is 
   subject to content negotiation. Caches differentiate these responses
   by incorporating some of the original request's header fields
   into the cache key as well, using information in the Vary
   response header field, as per <xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/>.
</t>
         <t>
  Caches might incorporate additional material into the cache key.
  For example, user agent caches might include the referring site's identity,
  thereby "double keying" the cache to avoid some privacy risks (see <xref target="security.timing"/>).
</t>
         <t>
   Most commonly, caches store the successful result of a retrieval
   request: i.e., a 200 (OK) response to a GET request, which
   contains a representation of the target resource
   (<xref target="HTTP" section="9.3.1"/>). However, it is also possible to store
   redirects, negative results (e.g., 404 (Not Found)),
   incomplete results (e.g., 206 (Partial Content)), and
   responses to methods other than GET if the method's definition allows such
   caching and defines something suitable for use as a cache key.
</t>
         <t>
   A cache is "disconnected" when it cannot contact the origin
   server or otherwise find a forward path for a request. A
   disconnected cache can serve stale responses in some circumstances (<xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).
</t>

</t>
         <t>
   In this context, a cache has "understood" a request method or a response
   status code if it recognizes it and implements all specified
   caching-related behavior.
</t>
         <t>
   Note that, in normal operation, some caches will not store a response that
   has neither a cache validator nor an explicit expiration time, as such
   responses are not usually useful to store. However, caches are not
   prohibited from storing such responses.

   (<xref target="HTTP" section="11.7.1"/>), Proxy-Authentication-Info
   (<xref target="HTTP" section="11.7.3"/>), and Proxy-Authorization
   (<xref target="HTTP" section="11.7.2"/>).</li>

            <t>
   Caches <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> either store trailer fields separate from header fields or

</t>
         </section>
         <section anchor="update" title="Updating Stored Header Fields">
            <t>
   Caches are required to update a stored response's header fields from another
   (typically newer) response in several situations; for example, see Sections <xref target="combining.responses" format="counter"/>, <xref target="freshening.responses" format="counter"/>, and
   <xref target="head.effects" format="counter"/>.
</t>
            <t>
   When doing so, the cache <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> add each header field in the provided response
   to the stored response, replacing field values that are already present,
   with the following exceptions:
</t>
            <ul>
               <li>Header fields excepted from storage in <xref target="storing.fields"/>,</li>
               <li>Header fields that the cache's stored response depends upon, as described below,</li>
               <li>Header fields that are automatically processed and removed by the recipient, as described below, and</li>
               <li>The Content-Length header field.</li>
            </ul>
            <t>
   In some cases, caches (especially in user agents) store the results of
   processing the received response, rather than the response itself,
   and updating header fields that affect that processing can result in
   inconsistent behavior and security issues. Caches in this situation <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
   omit these header fields from updating stored responses on an
   exceptional basis but <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> limit such omission to those fields
   necessary to assure integrity of the stored response.
</t>
            <t>
   For example, a browser might decode the content coding of a response
   while it is being received, creating a disconnect between the data it has
   stored and the response's original metadata.
   Updating that stored metadata with a different Content-Encoding
   header field would be problematic. Likewise, a browser might store a
   post-parse HTML tree rather than the content received in
   the response; updating the Content-Type header field would not be workable
   in this case because any assumptions about the format made in parsing would
   now be invalid.
</t>
            <t>
   Furthermore, some fields are automatically processed and removed by the
   HTTP implementation, such as the Content-Range header field.
   Implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> automatically omit such header fields from updates,
   even when the processing does not actually occur.
</t>
            <t>
   Note that the Content-* prefix is not a signal that a header field is omitted
   from update; it is a convention for MIME header fields, not HTTP.

   is recorded as being incomplete. Likewise, a 206 (Partial

</t>

   The header fields from two requests are defined to match if
   and only if those in the first request can be transformed to those in the

</t>
            <ul>
               <li>
     adding or removing whitespace, where allowed in the header field's

</t>
            <t>
   A stored response with a Vary header field value containing
   a member "*" always fails to match.
</t>
            <t>
   If multiple stored responses match,
   the cache will need to choose one to use.
   When a nominated request header field has a known mechanism for ranking preference
   (e.g., qvalues on Accept and similar request header
   fields), that mechanism <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used to choose a preferred response.
   If such a mechanism is not available, or leads to equally preferred
   responses, the most recent
   response (as determined by the Date header field) is
   chosen, as
   per <xref target="constructing.responses.from.caches"/>.
</t>
            <t>
   Some resources mistakenly omit the Vary header field from their default
   response (i.e., the one sent when the request does not express any preferences),
   with the effect of choosing it for subsequent requests to that resource
   even when more preferable responses are available. When a cache has
   multiple stored responses for a target URI and one or more omits the Vary
   header field, the cache <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> choose the most recent
   (see <xref target="age.calculations"/>) stored response with a valid Vary
   field value.
</t>

   A "fresh" response is one whose age has not yet exceeded its

            <t>
   A response's "freshness lifetime" is the length of time
   between its generation by the origin server and its expiration time. An
   "explicit expiration time" is the time at which the origin
   server intends that a stored response can no longer be used by a cache
   without further validation, whereas a "heuristic expiration
   time" is assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration time is
   available.
</t>
            <iref item="age"/>
            <t>
   A response's "age" is the time that has passed since it was
   generated by, or successfully validated with, the origin server.
</t>
            <t>
   When a response is fresh, it can be used to satisfy
   subsequent requests without contacting the origin server, thereby improving
   efficiency.
</t>
            <t>
   The primary mechanism for determining freshness is for an origin server to
   provide an explicit expiration time in the future, using either the
   <xref target="field.expires" format="none">Expires</xref> header field (<xref target="field.expires"/>) or
   the max-age response directive (<xref target="cache-response-directive.max-age"/>). Generally, origin servers
   will assign future explicit expiration times to responses in the belief
   that the representation is not likely to change in a semantically
   significant way before the expiration time is reached.
</t>
            <t>
   If an origin server wishes to force a cache to validate every request, it
   can assign an explicit expiration time in the past to indicate that the
   response is already stale. Compliant caches will normally validate a stale
   cached response before reusing it for subsequent requests (see <xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).
</t>
            <t>
   Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times,
   caches are also allowed to use a heuristic to determine an expiration time
   under certain circumstances (see <xref target="heuristic.freshness"/>).
</t>
            <t>
  The calculation to determine if a response is fresh is:
</t>
            <sourcecode type="pseudocode"><![CDATA[
   response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime > current_age)
]]></sourcecode>
            <t>
   freshness_lifetime is defined in <xref target="calculating.freshness.lifetime"/>; current_age is defined in
   <xref target="age.calculations"/>.
</t>
            <t>
   Clients can send the max-age or min-fresh request directives (<xref target="cache-request-directive"/>) to suggest limits on the freshness
   calculations for the corresponding response. However, caches are not
   required to honor them.
</t>
            <t>
   When calculating freshness, to avoid common problems in date parsing:
</t>
            <ul>
               <li>Although all date formats are specified to be case-sensitive,
      a cache recipient <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> match the field value
      case-insensitively.</li>
               <li>If a cache recipient's internal implementation of time has less
      resolution than the value of an HTTP-date, the recipient <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      internally represent a parsed <xref target="field.expires" format="none">Expires</xref> date as the
      nearest time equal to or earlier than the received value.</li>
               <li>A cache recipient <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> allow local time zones to influence the
      calculation or comparison of an age or expiration time.</li>
               <li>A cache recipient <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> consider a date with a zone abbreviation
      other than "GMT" to be invalid for calculating expiration.</li>
            </ul>
            <t>
   Note that freshness applies only to cache operation; it cannot be used to
   force a user agent to refresh its display or reload a resource. See <xref target="history.lists"/> for an explanation of the difference between

   When there is more than one value present for a given directive (e.g., two
   <xref target="field.expires" format="none">Expires</xref> header field lines or multiple Cache-Control: max-age

   be considered stale. If directives conflict (e.g.,
   both max-age and no-cache are present), the most restrictive directive should
   be honored. Caches are encouraged to consider responses that have
   invalid freshness information (e.g., a max-age directive with non-integer content) to

               <t>
   When generating a conditional request for validation, a cache either starts with
   a request it is attempting to satisfy or -- if it is initiating
   the request independently -- synthesizes a request using a stored
   response by copying the method, target URI, and request header fields
   identified by the Vary header field (<xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/>).
</t>
               <t>
   It then updates that request with one or more precondition header fields.
   These contain validator metadata sourced from a stored response(s) that has
   the same URI. Typically, this will include only the stored response(s) that
   has the same cache key, although a cache is allowed to validate
   a response that it cannot choose with the request header fields it is sending
   (see <xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/>).
</t>
               <t>
   The precondition header fields are then compared by recipients to
   determine whether any stored response is equivalent to a current
   representation of the resource.
</t>
               <t>
   One such validator is the timestamp given in a Last-Modified
   header field (<xref target="HTTP" section="8.8.2"/>), which can be used in an
   If-Modified-Since header field for response validation, or
   in an If-Unmodified-Since or If-Range header
   field for representation selection (i.e., the client is referring
   specifically to a previously obtained representation with that timestamp).
</t>
               <t>
   Another validator is the entity tag given in an ETag
   field (<xref target="HTTP" section="8.8.3"/>). One or more entity tags, indicating one or more
   stored responses, can be used in an If-None-Match header
   field for response validation, or in an If-Match or
   If-Range header field for representation selection (i.e.,
   the client is referring specifically to one or more previously obtained
   representations with the listed entity tags).
</t>
               <t>
   When generating a conditional request for validation, a cache:
</t>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send the relevant entity tags
     (using If-Match, If-None-Match, or
     If-Range) if the entity tags were provided in the
     stored response(s) being validated.</li>
                  <li>
                     <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send the Last-Modified value (using 
     If-Modified-Since) if the request is not for a subrange, 
     a single stored response is being validated, and that response 
     contains a Last-Modified value.</li>
                  <li>
                     <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> send the Last-Modified value (using 
     If-Unmodified-Since or If-Range) if 
     the request is for a subrange, a single stored response is being 
     validated, and that response contains only a Last-Modified value
     (not an entity tag).</li>
               </ul>
               <t>
   In most cases, both validators are generated in cache validation requests,
   even when entity tags are clearly superior, to allow old intermediaries
   that do not understand entity tag preconditions to respond appropriately.

               <t>
   Each client in the request chain may have its own cache, so it is common
   for a cache at an intermediary to receive conditional requests from other
   (outbound) caches. Likewise, some user agents make use of conditional
   requests to limit data transfers to recently modified representations or to
   complete the transfer of a partially retrieved representation.
</t>
               <t>
   If a cache receives a request that can be satisfied by reusing a stored
   200 (OK) or 206 (Partial Content)
   response, as per <xref target="constructing.responses.from.caches"/>,
   the cache <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> evaluate any applicable conditional header
   field preconditions received in that request with respect to the
   corresponding validators contained within the stored response.
</t>
               <t>
   A cache <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> evaluate conditional header fields that only
   apply to an origin server, occur in a request with semantics that
   cannot be satisfied with a cached response, or occur in a request with a target resource
   for which it has no stored responses; such preconditions are likely
   intended for some other (inbound) server.
</t>
               <t>
   The proper evaluation of conditional requests by a cache depends on the
   received precondition header fields and their precedence. In summary, the If-Match and
   If-Unmodified-Since conditional header fields are not
   applicable to a cache, and If-None-Match takes precedence over
   If-Modified-Since. See <xref target="HTTP" section="13.2.2"/> for
   a complete specification of precondition precedence.
</t>
               <t>
   A request containing an If-None-Match header field (<xref target="HTTP" section="13.1.2"/>) indicates that the client wants to
   validate one or more of its own stored responses in comparison to the
   stored response chosen by the cache (as per <xref target="constructing.responses.from.caches"/>).
</t>
               <t>
   If an If-None-Match header field is not present, a request
   containing an If-Modified-Since header field
   (<xref target="HTTP" section="13.1.3"/>) indicates that the client wants to validate
   one or more of its own stored responses by modification date.
</t>
               <t>
   If a request contains an If-Modified-Since header field and
   the Last-Modified header field is not present in a
   stored response, a cache <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the stored response's
   Date field value (or, if no Date field is present, the time
   that the stored response was received) to evaluate the conditional.
</t>
               <t>
   A cache that implements partial responses to range requests, as defined in
   <xref target="HTTP" section="14.2"/>, also needs to evaluate a received
   If-Range header field (<xref target="HTTP" section="13.1.5"/>)
   with respect to the cache's chosen response.

   from its own stored set of responses (fresh or stale) and send the union of
   the two lists as a replacement If-None-Match header
   field value in the forwarded request.
   If a stored response contains only partial content, the
   cache <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include its entity tag in the union unless the request is
   for a range that would be fully satisfied by that partial stored response.
   If the response to the forwarded request is
   304 (Not Modified) and has an ETag field value with
   an entity tag that is not in the client's list, the cache <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   generate a 200 (OK) response for the client by reusing its
   corresponding stored response, as updated by the 304 response metadata

</t>
               <ul>
                  <li>
     A 304 (Not Modified) response status code indicates

   </li>
                  <li>
     A full response (i.e., one containing content) indicates that none

     suitable. Instead, the cache <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the full response to
     satisfy the request. The cache <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> store such a full response,
     subject to its constraints (see <xref target="response.cacheability"/>).
   </li>
                  <li>
     However, if a cache receives a 5xx (Server Error)
     response while attempting to validate a response, it can either
     forward this response to the requesting client or act as if the
     server failed to respond. In the latter case, the cache can send a
     previously stored response, subject to its constraints on doing so (see <xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>), or retry the validation request.

   When a cache receives a 304 (Not Modified) response, it needs
   to identify stored responses that are suitable for updating with the new information
   provided, and then do so.
</t>
               <t>
   The initial set of stored responses to update are those that could have been chosen for

   to be fresh, able to be served stale, or just validated.

     If the new response contains one or more "strong validators" (see

     identifies a selected representation for update. All the stored
     responses in the initial set with one of those same strong validators are identified for update. If
     none of the initial set contains at least one of the same strong validators, then the
     cache <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the new response to update any stored responses.

     If the new response contains no strong validators but does contain
     one or more "weak validators", and those
     validators correspond to one of the initial set's stored responses, then the most
     recent of those matching stored responses is identified for update.
   </li>
                  <li>
     If the new response does not include any form of validator (such as

     a source other than the Last-Modified response header
     field), and there is only one stored response in the initial set, and that stored response
     also lacks a validator, then that stored response is identified for update.

               </ul>
               <t>

   A response to the HEAD method is identical to what an equivalent request

   In particular, the URI(s) in the

               "Invalidate" means that the cache will either remove all

   Behavioral extensions are designed to work by acting as modifiers to the

   Both the new directive and the old directive are supplied, such that
   applications that do not understand the new directive will default to the

   For example, consider a hypothetical new response directive called

   The "Pragma" request header field was defined for HTTP/1.0 caches, so that clients
   could specify a "no-cache" request (as <xref target="field.cache-control" format="none">Cache-Control</xref> was
   not defined until HTTP/1.1).
</t>
            <t>
   However, support for Cache-Control is now widespread. As a result, this
   specification deprecates Pragma.
</t>
            <aside>
               <t>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> Because the meaning of "Pragma: no-cache" in responses was never
      specified, it does not provide a reliable replacement for
      "Cache-Control: no-cache" in them.

            <iref item="Warning header field" primary="true"/>
            <t>
   The "Warning" header field was used to carry additional information
   about the status or transformation of a message that might not be reflected
   in the status code. This specification obsoletes it, as it is not widely
   generated or surfaced to users. The information it carried can be gleaned
   from examining other header fields, such as <xref target="field.age" format="none">Age</xref>.

      <section anchor="history.lists"
               title="Relationship to Applications and Other Caches">
         <t>
   Applications using HTTP often specify additional forms of caching. For
   example, Web browsers often have history mechanisms such as "Back" buttons
   that can be used to redisplay a representation retrieved earlier in a
   session.
</t>
         <t>
   Likewise, some Web browsers implement caching of images and other assets
   within a page view; they may or may not honor HTTP caching semantics.
</t>
         <t>
   The requirements in this specification do not necessarily apply to how
   applications use data after it is retrieved from an HTTP cache. For example, a
   history mechanism can display a previous representation even if it has
   expired, and an application can use cached data in other ways beyond its
   freshness lifetime.
</t>
         <t>
   This specification does not prohibit the application from taking HTTP caching into
   account; for example, a history mechanism might tell the user that a view
   is stale, or it might honor cache directives (e.g., Cache-Control:
   no-store).
</t>
         <t>
   However, when an application caches data and does not make this
   apparent to or easily controllable by the user, it is strongly encouraged to
   define its operation with respect to HTTP cache directives so as
   not to surprise authors who expect caching semantics
   to be honored. For example, while it might be reasonable to define an
   application cache "above" HTTP that allows a response containing
   Cache-Control: no-store to be reused for requests that are directly related
   to the request that fetched it (such as those created during the same page
   load), it would likely be surprising and confusing to users and authors if it
   were allowed to be reused for requests unrelated in any way to the one from
   which it was obtained.
</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security.considerations" title="Security Considerations">
         <t>
   This section is meant to inform developers, information providers, and
   users of known security concerns specific to HTTP caching.
   More general security considerations are addressed in "HTTP/1.1"
   (<xref target="HTTP11" section="11"/>)
   and "HTTP Semantics"
   (<xref target="HTTP" section="17"/>).
</t>
         <t>
   Caches expose an additional attack surface because the contents of
   the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation.
   Since cache contents persist after an HTTP request is complete, an attack
   on the cache can reveal information long after a user believes that the
   information has been removed from the network. Therefore, cache contents
   need to be protected as sensitive information.
</t>
         <t>
   In particular, because private caches are restricted to a single user,
   they can be used to reconstruct a user's activity. As a result, it is
   important for user agents to allow end users to control them, for example,
   by allowing stored responses to be removed for some or all origin servers.
</t>
         <section anchor="cache.poisoning" title="Cache Poisoning">
            <t>
   Storing malicious content in a cache can extend the reach of an attacker
   to affect multiple users. Such
   "cache poisoning" attacks happen when an attacker uses
   implementation flaws, elevated privileges, or other techniques to insert
   a response into a cache. This is especially effective when shared caches
   are used to distribute malicious content to many clients.
</t>
            <t>
   One common attack vector for cache poisoning is to exploit differences in
   message parsing on proxies and in user agents; see <xref target="HTTP11" section="6.3"/> for the relevant requirements regarding
   HTTP/1.1.
</t>
         </section>
         <section anchor="security.timing" title="Timing Attacks">
            <t>
   Because one of the primary uses of a cache is to optimize performance,
   its use can "leak" information about which resources have been previously
   requested.
</t>
            <t>
   For example, if a user visits a site and their browser caches some of its
   responses and then navigates to a second site, that site can attempt to
   load responses it knows exist on the first site. If they load
   quickly, it can be assumed that the user has visited that site, or even
   a specific page on it.
</t>
            <t>
   Such "timing attacks" can be mitigated by adding more information to the
   cache key, such as the identity of the referring site (to prevent the
   attack described above). This is sometimes called "double keying".
</t>
         </section>
         <section anchor="caching.of.sensitive.information"
                  title="Caching of Sensitive Information">
            <t>
   Implementation and deployment flaws (often led to by the misunderstanding of cache
   operation) might lead to the caching of sensitive information (e.g.,
   authentication credentials) that is thought to be private, exposing it to
   unauthorized parties.
</t>
            <t>
   Note that the Set-Cookie response header field <xref target="COOKIE"/>
   does not inhibit caching; a cacheable response with a Set-Cookie header
   field can be (and often is) used to satisfy subsequent requests to caches.
   Servers that wish to control caching of these responses are encouraged to
   emit appropriate Cache-Control response header fields.

         <t>
   Handling of duplicate and conflicting cache directives has been clarified.
   (<xref target="calculating.freshness.lifetime"/>)
</t>
         <t>
   Cache invalidation of the URIs in the Location and Content-Location
   header fields is no longer required but is still allowed.
   (<xref target="invalidation"/>)
</t>
         <t>
   Cache invalidation of the URIs in the Location and Content-Location header fields is disallowed
   when the origin is different; previously, it was the host.
   (<xref target="invalidation"/>)
</t>
         <t>
   Handling invalid and multiple Age header field values has been clarified.
   (<xref target="field.age"/>)
</t>
         <t>
   Some cache directives defined by this specification now have stronger
   prohibitions against generating the quoted form of their values, since
   this has been found to create interoperability problems. Consumers of
   extension cache directives are no longer required to accept both token and
   quoted-string forms, but they still need to parse them properly for
   unknown extensions.
   (<xref target="field.cache-control"/>)
</t>
         <t>
   The public and private cache directives were clarified, so that they
   do not make responses reusable under any condition.
   (<xref target="cache-response-directive"/>)
</t>
         <t>
   The must-understand cache directive was introduced; caches are no
   longer required to understand the semantics of new response status codes
   unless it is present.
   (<xref target="cache-response-directive.must-understand"/>)
</t>
         <t>
   The Warning response header was obsoleted. Much of the information
   supported by Warning could be gleaned by examining the response, and the
   remaining information -- although potentially useful -- was entirely
   advisory. In practice, Warning was not added by caches or intermediaries.
