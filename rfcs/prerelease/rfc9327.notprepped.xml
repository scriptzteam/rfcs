    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the structure of the control messages that were
      historically used
      with the Network Time Protocol (NTP) before the advent of more modern control and
      management approaches. These control messages have been used to
      monitor and control the NTP application running on any
      IP network attached computer. The information in this document
      was originally described in Appendix B of RFC 1305. The goal of this document
      is to provide an updated description of the control messages described in RFC
      1305 in order to conform with the updated NTP specification
      documented in RFC 5905.</t>
      <t>The publication of this document is not meant to encourage the development
      and deployment of these control messages. This document is only providing a
      current reference for these control messages given the current status of RFC
      1305.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC1305" format="default"/> describes a set of control messages
      for use within the Network Time Protocol (NTP) when a comprehensive network
      management solution was not available. The definitions of these control messages
      were not promulgated to <xref target="RFC5905" format="default"/> when NTP version
      4 was documented.  These messages were intended for use only in
      systems where no other management facilities were available or
      appropriate, such as in dedicated-function bus peripherals. Support for
      these messages is not required in order to conform to
      <xref target="RFC5905" format="default"/>. The control messages are described here as a
      current reference for use with an implementation of NTP from RFC 5905.</t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Control Message Overview</name>
        <t>The NTP mode 6 control messages are used by NTP management programs
	(e.g., ntpq) when a more robust network management facility (e.g., SNMP)
	is not available. These control messages provide rudimentary control and
	monitoring functions to manage a running instance of an NTP server. These
	commands are not designed to be used for communication between instances
	of running NTP servers.</t>
        <t>The NTP control message has the value 6 specified in the mode field
        of the first octet of the NTP header and is formatted as shown in
        <xref target="M6Hdr" format="default"/>.
        The format of the data field is specific to each command or response;
        however, in most cases, the format is designed to be constructed and
        viewed by humans and so is coded in free-form ASCII. This facilitates
        the specification and implementation of simple management tools in the
        absence of fully evolved network-management facilities. As in ordinary
        NTP messages, the authenticator field follows the data field. If the
        authenticator is used, the data field is zero-padded to a 32-bit
        boundary, but the padding bits are not considered part of the data field
        and are not included in the field count.</t>
	
        <t>IP hosts are not required to reassemble datagrams over a certain size
	(576 octets for IPv4 <xref target="RFC0791" format="default"/> and 1280 octets for
	IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>); however, some commands or responses may
        involve more data than
        will fit into a single datagram. Accordingly, a simple reassembly
        feature is included in which each octet of the message data is numbered
        starting with zero. As each fragment is transmitted, the number of its
        first octet is inserted in the offset field and the number of octets is
        inserted in the count field. The more-data (M) bit is set in all
        fragments except the last.</t>
        <t>Most control functions involve sending a command and receiving a
        response, perhaps involving several fragments. The sender chooses a
        distinct, nonzero sequence number and sets the status field, "R" bit, and "E"
        bit to zero. The responder interprets the opcode and additional
        information in the data field, updates the status field, sets the "R" bit
        to one and returns the three 32-bit words of the header along with
        additional information in the data field. In the case of invalid message
        format or contents, the responder inserts a code in the status field,
        sets the "R" and "E" bits to one and, optionally, inserts a diagnostic
        message in the data field.</t>
        <t>Some commands read or write system variables (e.g., s.offset) and peer
        variables (e.g., p.stratum) for
        an association identified in the command. Others read or write variables
        associated with a radio clock or other device directly connected to a
        source of primary synchronization information. To identify which type of
        variable and association, the Association ID is used. System
        variables are indicated by the identifier zero. As each association is
        mobilized a unique, nonzero identifier is created for it. These
        identifiers are used in a cyclic fashion, so that the chance of using an
        old identifier that matches a newly created association is remote. A
        management entity can request a list of current identifiers and
        subsequently use them to read and write variables for each association.
        An attempt to use an expired identifier results in an exception
        response, following which the list can be requested again.</t>
        <t>Some exception events, such as when a peer becomes reachable or
        unreachable, occur spontaneously and are not necessarily associated with
        a command. An implementation may elect to save the event information for
        later retrieval, to send an asynchronous response (called a trap), or
        both. In case of a trap, the IP address and port number are determined by
        a previous command and the sequence field is set as described below.
        Current status and summary information for the latest exception event is
        returned in all normal responses. Bits in the status field indicate
        whether an exception has occurred since the last response and whether
        more than one exception has occurred.</t>
        <t>Commands need not necessarily be sent by an NTP peer, so ordinary
        access-control procedures may not apply; however, the optional
	mask/match mechanism suggested in <xref target="Security" format="default"/>
	 provides the
        capability to control access by mode number, so this could be used to
        limit access for control messages (mode 6) to selected address
        ranges.</t>

        <name>Remote Facility Message Overview</name>
        <t>The original development of the NTP daemon included a Remote Facility
        for monitoring and configuration. This facility used mode 7 commands
        to communicate with the NTP daemon. This document illustrates the mode
        7 packet format only. The commands embedded in the mode 7 messages are
        implementation specific and not standardized in any way. The mode 7 message

        <t>There are two ways a reference clock can be attached to an NTP
        service host: as a dedicated device managed by the operating system
        and as a synthetic peer managed by NTP.  As in the read status command, the Association ID is used to
identify the correct variable for each clock: zero for the system clock and nonzero for a peer clock. Only one system clock is
        supported by the protocol, although many peer clocks can be supported.
        A system or peer clock status word appears in the status field of the
        response to a read clock variables or write clock variables command.

      <t>Commands consist of the header and optional data field shown in
      <xref target="M6Hdr" format="default"/>. When present, the data field contains a list of
      identifiers or assignments in the form
      &lt;&lt;identifier&gt;&gt;[=&lt;&lt;value&gt;&gt;],&lt;&lt;identifier&gt;&gt;[=&lt;&lt;value&gt;&gt;],...
      where &lt;&lt;identifier&gt;&gt; is the ASCII name of a system or peer
      variable such as the ones specified in RFC 5905 and
      &lt;&lt;value&gt;&gt; is expressed as a decimal, hexadecimal, or string
      constant in the syntax of the C programming language. Where no ambiguity
      exists, the "sys." or "peer." prefixes can be suppressed.
      Space characters (ASCII nonprinting format effectors) can be added to improve
      readability for simple monitoring programs that do not reformat the data
      field.  Representations of note are as follows:</t>
<ul><li>
      IPv4 internet addresses
      are written in the form [n.n.n.n], where n is in decimal notation and
      the brackets are optional</li>
      <li>IPv6 internet addresses are formulated based on the
      guidelines defined in <xref target="RFC5952" format="default"/>.</li>
      <li>Timestamps (including reference, originate, receive, and transmit values)
      and the logical clock are represented in units of seconds and
      fractions, preferably in hexadecimal notation.</li>
      <li>Delay, offset,
      dispersion, and distance values are represented in units of milliseconds
      and fractions, preferably in decimal notation.</li>
      <li>All other values are
      represented as is, preferably in decimal notation.</li>
</ul>
      <t>Implementations may define variables other than those described in
      RFC 5905; called "extramural variables", these are
      distinguished by the inclusion of some character type other than
      alphanumeric or "." in the name. For those commands
      that return a list of assignments in the response data field, if the
      command data field is empty, it is expected that all available variables
      defined in RFC 5905 will be included in the
      response. For the read commands, if the command data field is nonempty,
      an implementation may choose to process this field to individually
      select which variables are to be returned.</t>
      <t>Commands are interpreted as follows:</t>
<dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
      <dt>Read Status (1):</dt><dd>The command data field is empty or contains a list
      of identifiers separated by commas. The command operates in two ways
      depending on the value of the Association ID. If this identifier
      is nonzero, the response includes the peer identifier and status word.
      Optionally, the response data field may contain other information, such
      as described in the Read Variables command. If the association
      identifier is zero, the response includes the system identifier (0) and
      status word; the data field contains a list of binary-coded pairs
      &lt;&lt;Association ID&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;status word&gt;&gt;, one
      for each currently defined association.</dd>
      <dt>Read Variables (2):</dt><dd>The command data field is empty or contains a
      list of identifiers separated by commas. If the Association ID
      is nonzero, the response includes the requested peer identifier and
      status word; the data field contains a list of peer variables and
      values as described above. If the Association ID is zero, the
      data field contains a list of system variables. If a peer has
      been selected as the synchronization source, the response includes the
      peer identifier and status word; otherwise, the response includes the
      system identifier (0) and status word.</dd>
      <dt>Write Variables (3):</dt><dd>The command data field contains a list of
      assignments as described above. The variables are updated as indicated.
      The response is as described for the Read Variables command.</dd>
      <dt>Read Clock Variables (4):</dt><dd>The command data field is empty or contains
      a list of identifiers separated by commas. The Association ID
      selects the system clock variables or peer clock variables in the same
      way as in the Read Variables command. The response includes the
      requested clock identifier and status word; the data field contains a
      list of clock variables and values, including the last timecode message
      received from the clock.</dd>
      <dt>Write Clock Variables (5):</dt><dd>The command data field contains a list of
      assignments as described above. The clock variables are updated as
      indicated. The response is as described for the read clock variables
      command.</dd>
      <dt>Set Trap Address/Port (6):</dt><dd>The command Association ID, status,
      and data fields are ignored. The address and port number for subsequent
      trap messages are taken from the source address and port of the control
      message itself. The initial trap counter for trap response messages is
      taken from the sequence field of the command. The response association
      identifier, status, and data fields are not significant. Implementations
      should include logical timeouts that prevent trap transmissions if the
      monitoring program does not renew this information after a lengthy
      interval.</dd>
      <dt>Trap Response (7):</dt><dd>This message is sent when a system, peer, or clock
      exception event occurs. The opcode field is 7 and the R bit is set. The
      trap counter is incremented by one for each trap sent and the sequence
      field set to that value. The trap message is sent using the IP address
      and port fields established by the set trap address/port command. If a
      system trap, the Association ID field is set to zero and the
      status field contains the system status word. If a peer trap, the
      Association ID field is set to that peer and the status field
      contains the peer status word. Optional ASCII-coded information can be
      included in the data field.</dd>
      <dt>Configure (8):</dt><dd>The command data is parsed and applied as if supplied
	      in the daemon configuration file.</dd>
      <dt>Save Configuration (9):</dt><dd>Writes a snapshot of the current configuration
      to the file name supplied as the command data.
      Further, the command is refused unless a directory in which to store
      the resulting files has been explicitly configured by the operator.</dd>
      <dt>Read Most Recently Used (MRU) list (10):</dt><dd>Retrieves records
      of recently seen remote addresses and associated statistics.  This
      command supports all of the state variables defined in <xref
      target="RFC5905" sectionFormat="of" section="9"/>.  Command data
      consists of name=value pairs controlling the selection of records, as
      well as a requestor-specific nonce previously retrieved using this
      command or opcode 12 (Request Nonce).  The response consists of
      name=value pairs where some names can appear multiple times using a dot
      followed by a zero-based index to distinguish them and to associate
      elements of the same record with the same index.  A new nonce is
      provided with each successful response.</dd>
      <dt>Read ordered list (11):</dt><dd>Retrieves a list ordered by IP address
      (IPv4 information precedes IPv6 information).  If the command
      data is empty or is the seven characters "ifstats", the associated
      statistics, status, and counters for each local address are returned.
      If the command data is the characters "addr_restrictions", then the
      set of IPv4 remote address restrictions followed by the set of IPv6
      remote address restrictions (access control lists) are returned.
      Other command data returns error code 5 (unknown variable name).
      Similar to Read MRU, response information uses zero-based indexes as
      part of the variable name preceding the equals sign and value, where
      each index relates information for a single address or network.  This
      opcode requires authentication.</dd>
      <dt>Request Nonce (12):</dt><dd>Retrieves a 96-bit nonce specific to the
      requesting remote address, which is valid for a limited period.
      Command data is not used in the request.  The nonce consists of a
      64-bit NTP timestamp and 32 bits of hash derived from that timestamp,
      the remote address, and salt known only to the server, which varies
      between daemon runs. Inclusion of the
      nonce by a management agent demonstrates to the server that the agent
      can receive datagrams sent to the source address of the request,
      making source address "spoofing" more difficult in a similar way as
      TCP's three-way handshake.</dd>
      <dt>Unset Trap (31):</dt><dd>Removes the requesting remote address and port from
      the list of trap receivers.  Command data is not used in the request.
      If the address and port are not in the list of trap receivers, the
      error code is 4 (bad association).</dd>

      <t>A number of security vulnerabilities have been identified with
      these control messages.</t>
      <t>NTP's control query interface allows reading and writing of system,
      peer, and clock variables remotely from arbitrary IP addresses using
      commands mentioned in <xref target="commands"/>.  Overwriting these
      variables, but not reading them, requires authentication by default.
      However, this document argues that an NTP host must authenticate all
      control queries and not just ones that overwrite these variables.
      Alternatively, the host can use an access control list to explicitly list IP
      addresses that are allowed to control query the clients. These access
      controls are required for the following reasons:</t>
      
     <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
        <dt>NTP as a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) vector:</dt><dd>NTP timing query
         and response packets (modes 1-2, 3-4, and 5) are usually short in size. However,
         some NTP control queries generate a very long packet in response to a
         short query. As such, there is a history of use of NTP's control queries,
         which exhibit such behavior, to perform DoS attacks. These off-path attacks
         exploit the large size of NTP control queries to cause UDP-based
         amplification attacks (e.g., mode 7 monlist command generates a very long
         packet in response to a small query <xref target="CVE-DOS" format="default"/>). These attacks only
         use NTP as a vector for DoS attacks on other protocols, but do not affect
         the time service on the NTP host itself. To limit the sources of these
         malicious commands, NTP server operators are recommended to deploy ingress
         filtering <xref target="RFC3704" format="default"/>.</dd>
        <dt>Time-shifting attacks through information leakage/overwriting:</dt><dd>NTP hosts
         save important system and peer state variables. An off-path attacker who can
         read these variables remotely can leverage the information leaked by these
         control queries to perform time-shifting and DDoS attacks on NTP clients. These
         attacks do affect time synchronization on the NTP hosts.  For instance:</dd>
</dl>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>In the client/server mode, the client stores its local time when it sends the
            query to the server in its xmt peer variable. This variable is used to perform
            TEST2 to non-cryptographically authenticate the server (i.e., if the origin
            timestamp field in the corresponding server response packet matches the xmt peer
            variable, then the client accepts the packet). An off-path attacker with the ability
            to read this variable can easily spoof server response packets for the client, which
            will pass TEST2 and can deny service or shift time on the NTP client. The specific
            attack is described in <xref target="CVE-SPOOF" format="default"/>.</li>
<li>The client also stores its local time when the server response is received in its
            rec peer variable. This variable is used for authentication in interleaved-pivot mode.
            An off-path attacker with the ability to read this state variable can easily shift time
            on the client by passing this test. This attack is described in <xref target="CVE-SHIFT" format="default"/>.</li>
          </ul>
<dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
        <dt>Fast-Scanning:</dt><dd>NTP mode 6 control messages are usually small UDP packets. Fast-scanning
         tools like ZMap can be used to spray the entire (potentially reachable) Internet with these
         messages within hours to identify vulnerable hosts. To make things worse, these attacks can
         be extremely low-rate, only requiring a control query for reconnaissance and a spoofed
         response to shift time on vulnerable clients.</dd>
        <dt>The mode 6 and 7 messages are vulnerable to replay attacks <xref target="CVE-Replay" format="default"/>:</dt><dd>
         If an attacker observes mode 6/7 packets that modify the configuration of the server in any
         way, the attacker can apply the same change at any time later by simply sending the packets
         to the server again. The use of the nonce (Request Nonce command) provides limited protection
         against replay attacks.</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>NTP best practices recommend configuring NTP with the no-query parameter. The no-query
      parameter blocks access to all remote control queries. However, sometimes the hosts do not
      want to block all queries and want to give access for certain control queries remotely. This
      could be for the purpose of remote management and configuration of the hosts in certain
      scenarios. Such hosts tend to use firewalls or other middleboxes to blacklist certain queries
      within the network.</t>
      <t>Significantly fewer hosts respond to mode 7
      monlist queries as compared to other control queries because it is a well-known and exploited
      control query. These queries are likely blocked using blacklists on firewalls and middleboxes
      rather than the no-query option on NTP hosts. The remaining control queries that can be
      exploited likely remain out of the blacklist because they are undocumented in the current
      NTP specification <xref target="RFC5905" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>This document describes all of the mode 6 control queries allowed by NTP and can help
      administrators make informed decisions on security measures to protect NTP devices from
      harmful queries and likely make those systems less vulnerable. The use of the legacy mode 6
      interface is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.  Regardless of which mode
      6 commands an administrator may elect to allow, remote access to this facility needs to be
      protected from unauthorized access (e.g., strict Access Control Lists (ACLs)). Additionally, the legacy interface
      for mode 6 commands <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be utilized in new deployments or implementation of NTP.</t>
