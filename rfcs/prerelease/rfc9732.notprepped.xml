    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a framework for Enhanced Virtual Private
      Networks (VPNs) based on Network Resource Partitions (NRPs) in order to
      support the needs of applications with specific traffic performance
      requirements (e.g., low latency, bounded jitter). NRP-based enhanced
      VPNs leverage the VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies and add
      characteristics that specific services require beyond those provided by
      conventional VPNs. Typically, an NRP-based enhanced VPN will be used to
      underpin network slicing, but it could also be of use in its own right
      providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites. This
      document also provides an overview of relevant technologies in different
      network layers and identifies some areas for potential new work.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have served the industry well as a
      means of providing different groups of users with logically isolated
      connectivity over a common network. The common (base) network that is
      used to provide the VPNs is often referred to as the "underlay", and the
      VPN is often called an "overlay".</t>
      <t>Customers of a network operator may request connectivity services
      with advanced characteristics, such as low-latency guarantees, bounded
      jitter, or isolation from other services or customers, so that changes in
      other services (e.g., changes in network load, or events such as
      congestion or outages) have no effect or only acceptable effects on the
      observed throughput or latency of the services delivered to the
      customer. These services are referred to as "enhanced VPNs", as they are
      similar to VPN services, providing the customer with the required
      connectivity, but they also provide enhanced characteristics.</t>

      
      <t>This document describes a framework for delivering VPN services with
      enhanced characteristics, such as guaranteed resources, latency, jitter,
      etc. This list is not exhaustive. It is expected that other enhanced
      features may be added to VPN over time and that this
      framework will support these additions with necessary changes or
      enhancements in some network layers and network planes (data plane,
      control plane, and management plane).</t>
      <t>The concept of network slicing has gained traction, driven largely by
      needs surfacing from 5G (see <xref target="NGMN-NS-Concept" format="default"/>, <xref target="TS23501" format="default"/>, and <xref target="TS28530" format="default"/>). According to <xref target="TS28530" format="default"/>, a 5G end-to-end network slice consists of three
      major types of network segments: Radio Access Network (RAN), Transport
      Network (TN), and mobile Core Network (CN). The transport network
      provides the connectivity between different entities in RAN and CN
      segments of a 5G end-to-end network slice, with specific performance
      commitments.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC9543" format="default"/> discusses the general framework, components,
      and interfaces for requesting and operating network slices using IETF
      technologies. These network slices may be referred to as "RFC 9543
      Network Slices", but in this document (which is solely about IETF
      technologies), we simply use the term "network slice" to refer to this
      concept. A network slice service enables connectivity between a set of
      Service Demarcation Points (SDPs) with specific Service Level Objectives
      (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay
      network. A network slice can be realized as a logical network connecting
      a number of endpoints and is associated with a set of shared or
      dedicated network resources that are used to satisfy the SLO and SLE      requirements. A network slice is considered to be one target use case of
      enhanced VPNs.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC9543" format="default"/> also introduces the concept of NRP, which is a subset of the
      buffer/queuing/scheduling resources and associated policies on each of a
      connected set of links in the underlay network. An NRP can be associated
      with a dedicated or shared network topology to select or specify the set
      of links and nodes involved.</t>
      <t>The requirements of enhanced VPN services cannot simply be met by
      overlay networks: enhanced VPN services require tighter coordination
      and integration between the overlay and the underlay networks.</t>
      <t>In the overlay network, the VPN has been defined as the network
      construct to provide the required connectivity for different services or
      customers. Multiple VPN flavors can be considered to create that
      construct <xref target="RFC4026" format="default"/>. In the underlay network, the NRP is
      used to represent a subset of the network resources and associated
      policies in the underlay network. An NRP can be associated with a
      dedicated or shared network topology to select or specify the set of
      links and nodes involved.</t>
      <t>An enhanced VPN service can be realized by integrating a VPN in the
      overlay and an NRP in the underlay. This is called an "NRP-based enhanced
      VPN". In doing so, an enhanced VPN service can provide enhanced
      properties, such as guaranteed resources and assured or predictable
      performance. An enhanced VPN service may also involve a set of service
      functions (see <xref target="RFC7665" sectionFormat="of" section="1.4"/> for the
      definition of service function). The techniques for delivering an
      NRP-based enhanced VPN can be used to instantiate a network slice
      service (as described in <xref target="app-ns-realization" format="default"/>), and they
      can also be of use in general cases to provide enhanced connectivity
      services between customer sites or service endpoints.</t>
      <t>This document describes a framework for using existing, modified, and
      potential new technologies as components to provide NRP-based enhanced
      VPN services. Specifically, this document provides:</t>

          switching traffic to an alternate path) to avoid SLA violation.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>One possible layered network structure to achieve these objectives is

      <t>It is not envisaged that enhanced VPN services will replace
      conventional VPN services. VPN services will continue to be delivered
      using existing mechanisms and can coexist with enhanced VPN services.
      Whether enhanced VPN features are added to an active VPN service is
      deployment specific.</t>

      <name>Terminology</name>
      <t>In this document, the relationship of the four terms "VPN", "enhanced
      VPN", "NRP", and "Network Slice" are as follows:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>

          <t>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) refers to the overlay network
          service that provides connectivity between different customer sites
          and that maintains traffic separation between different customers.
          Examples of technologies to provide VPN services are as follows: IP VPN <xref target="RFC2764" format="default"/> <xref           
target="RFC4364" format="default"/>, L2VPN <xref target="RFC4664" format="default"/>, and EVPN <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>An enhanced VPN service is an evolution of the VPN service that
          makes additional service-specific commitments. An NRP-based enhanced
          VPN is made by integrating a VPN with a set of network resources
          allocated in the underlay network (i.e., an NRP).</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>An NRP, as defined in <xref target="RFC9543" format="default"/>, is a subset of the buffer/queuing/scheduling
          resources and associated policies on each of a connected set of
          links in the underlay network. An NRP can be associated with a
          dedicated or shared network topology to select or specify the set of
          links and nodes involved. An NRP is designed to meet the network
          resources and performance characteristics required by the enhanced
          VPN services.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>A network slice service could be delivered by provisioning one or
          more NRP-based enhanced VPNs in the network. Other mechanisms for
          realizing network slices may exist but are not in the scope of this
          document.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>The term "tenant" is used in this document to refer to a customer of
      the enhanced VPN services.</t>
      <t>The following terms, defined in other documents, are also used in

      <name>Overview of the Requirements</name>
      <t>This section provides an overview of the requirements of an enhanced
      VPN service.</t>
      <section anchor="diverse-performance-guarantees" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Performance Guarantees</name>
        <t>Performance guarantees are committed by network operators to their
        customers in relation to the services delivered to the customers. They
        are usually expressed in SLAs as a set of SLOs.</t>
        <t>There are several kinds of performance guarantees, including
        guaranteed maximum packet loss, guaranteed maximum delay, and
        guaranteed delay variation. Note that these guarantees apply to
        conformance traffic; out-of-profile traffic will be handled according
        to a separate agreement with the customer (see, for example,
        <xref target="RFC7297" sectionFormat="of" section="3.6"/>).</t>
        <t>Guaranteed maximum packet loss is usually addressed by setting
        packet priorities, queue sizes, and discard policies. However, this
        becomes more difficult when the requirement is combined with latency
        requirements. The limiting case is zero congestion loss, and that is
        the goal of DetNet <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>
        and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) <xref target="TSN" format="default"/>. In modern
        optical networks, loss due to transmission errors already approaches
        zero, but there is the possibility of failure of the interface or the
        fiber itself. This type of fault can be addressed by some form of
        signal duplication and transmission over diverse paths.</t>
        <t>Guaranteed maximum latency is required by a number of applications,
        particularly real-time control applications and some types of
        augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications. DetNet
        techniques may be considered <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>; however,
        additional methods of enhancing the underlay to better support the
        delay guarantees may be needed. These methods will need to be
        integrated with the overall service provisioning mechanisms.</t>
        <t>Guaranteed maximum delay variation is a performance guarantee that
        may also be needed. <xref target="RFC8578" format="default"/> calls up a number of
        cases that need this guarantee, for example, in electrical utilities.
        Time transfer is an example service that needs this performance
        guarantee, although it is in the nature of time that the service might
        be delivered by the underlay as a shared service and not provided
        through different enhanced VPNs. Alternatively, a dedicated enhanced
        VPN might be used to provide time transfer as a shared service.</t>
        <t>This suggests that a spectrum of service guarantees needs to be
        considered when designing and deploying an enhanced VPN. For
        illustration purposes and without claiming to be exhaustive, four
        types of services are considered:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Best effort</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Assured bandwidth</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Guaranteed latency</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Enhanced delivery</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>It is noted that some services may have mixed requirements from
        this list, e.g., both assured bandwidth and guaranteed latency can be
        required.</t>
        <t>The best-effort service is the basic connectivity service that can
        be provided by current VPNs.</t>
        <t>An assured bandwidth service is a connectivity service in which the
        bandwidth over some period of time is assured. This could be achieved
        either simply based on a best-effort service with over-capacity
        provisioning or based on MPLS TE Label
        Switching Paths (TE-LSPs) with bandwidth reservations. Depending on
        the technique used, however, the bandwidth is not necessarily assured
        at any instant. Providing assured bandwidth to VPNs, for example, by
        using per-VPN TE-LSPs, is not widely deployed at least partially due
        to scalability concerns. The more common approach of aggregating
        multiple VPNs onto common TE-LSPs results in shared bandwidth and so
        may reduce the assurance of bandwidth to any one service. Enhanced
        VPNs aim to provide a more scalable approach for such services.</t>


        <t>A guaranteed latency service has an upper bound to edge-to-edge
        latency. Assuring the upper bound is sometimes more important than
        minimizing latency. There are several new technologies that provide
        some assistance with this performance guarantee:</t>
	<ul>
	  <li>the IEEE TSN
        project <xref target="TSN" format="default"/> introduces the concept of scheduling of
          delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive packets.</li>
	  <li>FlexE <xref target="FLEXE" format="default"/> is
          useful to help provide a guaranteed upper bound to latency.</li>
	  <li>DetNet is of relevance in assuring an upper bound of end-to-end
          packet latency in the network layer.</li>
	</ul>
	<t>The use of these technologies to
        deliver enhanced VPN services needs to be considered when a guaranteed
        latency service is required.</t>
        <t>An enhanced delivery service is a connectivity service in which the
        underlay network (at Layer 3) needs to ensure to eliminate or minimize
        packet loss in the event of equipment or media failures. This may be
        achieved by delivering a copy of the packet through multiple paths.
        Such a mechanism may need to be used for enhanced VPN services.</t>

      <section anchor="interaction-between-vpn-services" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Interaction Between Enhanced VPN Services</name>
        <t>There is a fine distinction between how a customer requests limits
        on interaction between an enhanced VPN service and other services
        (whether they are other enhanced VPN services or any other network
        service) and how that is delivered by the service provider. This
        section examines the requirements and realization of limited
        interaction between an enhanced VPN service and other services.</t>
        <section anchor="requirements-on-traffic-isolation" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Requirements on Traffic Isolation</name>
          <t>"Traffic isolation" is a generic term that can be used to describe
          the requirements for separating the services of different customers
          or different service types in the network. In the context of network
          slicing, traffic isolation is defined as an SLE of the network slice
          service (<xref target="RFC9543" sectionFormat="of" section="8.1"/>), which is one
          element of the SLA. A customer may care about disruption caused by
          other services, contamination by other traffic, or delivery of their
          traffic to the wrong destinations.</t>
          <t>A customer may want to specify (and thus pay for) the traffic
          isolation provided by the service provider. Some customers (banking,
          for example) may have strict requirements on how their flows are
          handled when delivered over a shared network. Some professional
          services are used to relying on specific certifications and audits
          to ensure the compliancy of a network with traffic-isolation
          requirements and, specifically, to prevent data leaks.</t>
          <t>With traffic isolation, a customer expects that the service
          traffic cannot be received by other customers in the same network.
          In <xref target="RFC4176" format="default"/>, traffic isolation is mentioned as one
          of the requirements of VPN customers. Traffic isolation is also
          described in <xref target="RFC7297" sectionFormat="of" section="3.8"/>.</t>
          <t>There can be different expectations of traffic isolation. For
          example, a customer may further request the protection of their
          traffic by requesting specific encryption schemes at the enhanced
          VPN access and also when transported between Provider Edge
          (PE) nodes.</t>
          <t>An enhanced VPN service customer may request traffic isolation
          together with other operator-defined service characteristics. The
          exact details about the expected behavior need to be specified in
          the service request so that meaningful service assurance and
          fulfillment feedback can be exposed to the customer. It is out of
          the scope of this document to elaborate the service-modeling
          considerations.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="limited-interaction-with-other-services" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Limited Interaction with Other Services</name>
          <t><xref target="RFC2211" format="default"/> describes the controlled-load service.
          In that document, the end-to-end behavior provided to an application
          by a series of network elements providing controlled-load service is
          described as closely approximating to the behavior visible to
          applications receiving best-effort service when those network
          elements are not carrying substantial traffic from other
          services.</t>
          <t>Thus, a consumer of a controlled-load service may assume
          that:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>A very high percentage of transmitted packets will be
              successfully delivered by the network to the receiving
              end nodes.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The transit delay experienced by a very high percentage of
              the delivered packets will not greatly exceed the minimum
              transmit delay experienced by any successfully delivered
              packet.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>An enhanced VPN customer may request a controlled-load service in
          one of two ways:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
              <t>It may configure a set of SLOs (for example, for delay and
              loss) such that the delivered enhanced VPN meets the behavioral
              objectives of the customer.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>As described in <xref target="RFC2211" format="default"/>, a customer may
              request the controlled-load service without reference to or

              such as delay or loss. Instead, acceptance of a request for
              controlled-load service is defined to imply a commitment by the
              network element to provide the requestor with service closely
              equivalent to that provided to uncontrolled (best-effort)
              traffic under lightly loaded conditions. This way of requesting

          <name>Realization of Limited Interaction with Enhanced VPN Services</name>
          <t>A service provider may translate the requirements related to
          limited interaction into distinct engineering rules in its network.
          Honoring the service requirement may involve tweaking a set of QoS,
          TE, security, and planning tools, while traffic isolation will
          involve adequately configuring routing and authorization
          capabilities.</t>
          <t>Concretely, there are many existing techniques that can be used
          to provide traffic isolation, such as IP and MPLS VPNs or other
          multi-tenant virtual network techniques. Controlled-load services
          may be realized as described in <xref target="RFC2211" format="default"/>. Other
          tools may include various forms of resource management and
          reservation techniques, such as network capacity planning,
          allocating dedicated network resources, traffic policing or shaping,
          prioritizing in using shared network resources, etc., so that a
          subset of bandwidth, buffers, and queueing resources can be
          available in the underlay network to support the enhanced VPN
          services.</t>


          <t>To provide the required traffic isolation, or to reduce the
          interaction with other enhanced VPN services, network resources may
          need to be reserved in the data plane of the underlay network and
          dedicated to traffic from a specific enhanced VPN service or a
          specific group of enhanced VPN services.

This may introduce scalability concerns in the implementation, as each
enhanced VPN may need to be tracked in the network. It may also introduce
scalability concerns in deployment, such as how many resources need to be
reserved and how the services are mapped to the resources (<xref
target="scalable-mapping"/>). Thus, some trade-off needs to be considered to
provide the traffic isolation and limited interaction between an enhanced VPN
service and other services.</t>
	  
          <t>A dedicated physical network can be used to meet stricter SLO and
          SLE requests, at the cost of allocating resources on a long-term and
          end- to-end basis. On the other hand, where adequate traffic
          isolation and limited interaction can be achieved at the packet
          layer, this permits the resources to be shared amongst a group of
          services and only dedicated to a service on a temporary basis. By
          combining conventional VPNs with TE, QoS, and security techniques,
          an enhanced VPN offers a variety of means to honor customer's
          requirements.</t>

        <name>Integration with Network Resources and Service Functions</name>
	
        <t>The way to meet the enhanced VPN service's demand for certain
        characteristics (such as guaranteed or predictable performance) is by
        integrating the overlay VPN with a particular set of resources in the
        underlay network that are allocated to meet the service requirements.
        This needs to be done in a flexible and scalable way so that it can be
        widely deployed in operators' networks to support a good number of
        enhanced VPN services.</t>
        <t>Taking mobile networks and, in particular, 5G into consideration, the
        integration of the network with service functions is likely a
        requirement. The IETF's work on Service Function Chaining (SFC) <xref target="RFC7665" format="default"/> provides a foundation for this. Service functions
        in the underlay network can be considered to be part of the enhanced VPN
        services, which means the service functions may need to be an integral
        part of the corresponding NRP. The details of the integration between
        service functions and enhanced VPNs are out of the scope of this
        document.</t>

          <name>Abstraction</name>
          <t>Integration of the overlay VPN and the underlay network resources
          and service functions does not always need to be a direct mapping.
          As described in <xref target="RFC7926" format="default"/>, abstraction is the process
          of applying policy to a set of information about a traffic-engineered network to produce selective information that
          represents the potential ability to connect across the network. The
          process of abstraction presents the connectivity graph in a way that
          is independent of the underlying network technologies, capabilities,
          and topology so that the graph can be used to plan and deliver
          network services in a uniform way.</t>
	  
          <t>Using the abstraction approach, an enhanced VPN may be built on
          top of an abstracted topology that represents the connectivity
          capabilities of the underlay TE-based network as described in the
          framework for Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) <xref target="RFC8453" format="default"/> as discussed further in <xref target="management-plane" format="default"/>.</t>

        <t>Enhanced VPNs need to be created, modified, and removed from the
        network according to service demands (including scheduled requests).
        An enhanced VPN that requires limited interaction with other services
        (<xref target="limited-interaction-with-other-services" format="default"/>) must not be
        disrupted by the instantiation or modification of another enhanced VPN
        service. As discussed in <xref target="RFC4176" sectionFormat="of" section="3.1"/>, the
        assessment of traffic isolation is part of the management of a VPN
        service. Determining whether modification of an enhanced VPN can be
        disruptive to that enhanced VPN and whether the traffic in flight will
        be disrupted can be a difficult problem.</t>
        <t>Dynamic changes both to the enhanced VPN and to the underlay
        network need to be managed to avoid disruption to services that are
        sensitive to changes in network performance.</t>
	
        <t>In addition to managing the network without disruption during changes
        such as the inclusion of a new enhanced VPN service endpoint or a
        change to a link, enhanced VPN traffic might need to be moved because
        of changes to traffic patterns and volume. This means that during the
        lifetime of an enhanced VPN service, closed-loop optimization is
        needed so that the delivered service always matches the ordered
        SLA.</t>

        <t>In many cases enhanced VPN services are delivered to customers
        without information about the underlying NRPs. However, in some cases, depending on
        the agreement between the operator and the customer, the
        customer may also be provided with some information about the
        underlying NRPs. Such information can be filtered or aggregated
        according to the operator's policy. This allows the customer of an
        enhanced VPN service to have some visibility and even control over how
        the underlying topology and resources of the NRP are used. For
        example, the customer may be able to specify the path or path
        constraints within the NRP for specific traffic flows of their
        enhanced VPN service. Depending on the requirements, an enhanced VPN
        customer may have their own network controller, which may be provided
        with an interface to the control or management system run by the
        network operator. Note that such a control is within the scope of the

        entity, for example, an Autonomous System (AS). In some domains, the
        network operator may manage a multi-layered network, for example, a

        provisioned in such network scenarios, the technologies used in
        different network planes (the data plane, control plane, and management
        plane) need to provide mechanisms to support multi-domain and
        multi-layer coordination and integration; this is to provide the
        required service characteristics for different enhanced VPN services
        and improve network efficiency and operational simplicity. The

        </figure>
        <t>Various components and techniques discussed in <xref target="SDDC" format="default"/> can be used to enable resource partitioning of the
        physical network infrastructure, such as FlexE, TSN, dedicated queues,
        etc. These partitions may be physical or virtual so long as the SLA
        required by the higher layers is met.</t>

	
<t>Based on the set of NRPs provided by the
        physical network infrastructure, multiple NRPs can be created. Each of these NRPs:</t><ul>
	<li>has a set of dedicated or shared network resources allocated from the
        physical underlay network,</li>
	<li>can be associated with a
        customized logical network topology, and</li>
	<li>meets the requirements of a specific enhanced VPN service or
	a specific group of enhanced VPN services.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>According to the associated logical network topology, each
        NRP needs to be instantiated on a set of network nodes and links that
        are involved in the logical topology. On each node or link, each
        NRP is associated with a set of local resources that are allocated
        for the processing of traffic in the NRP. The NRP provides the
        integration between the logical network topology and the required
      underlying network resources.</t>

        <t>According to the service requirements of connectivity, performance,
        isolation, etc., enhanced VPN services can be mapped to the
        appropriate NRPs in the network. Different enhanced VPN services can
        be mapped to different NRPs; it is also possible that multiple
        enhanced VPN services are mapped to the same NRP. Thus, the NRP is an
        essential scaling technique as it has the potential of eliminating
        per-service per-path state from the network. In addition, when a group
        of enhanced VPN services is mapped to a single NRP, only the network
        state of the single NRP needs to be maintained in the network (see
        <xref target="scalable-mapping" format="default"/> for more information).</t>
        <t>The network controller is responsible for creating an NRP,
        instructing the involved network nodes to allocate network resources
        to the NRP, and provisioning the enhanced VPN services on the NRP. A
        distributed control plane may be used for distributing the NRP
        resource and topology attributes among nodes in the NRP. Extensions to
        distributed control protocols (if any) are out of the scope of this
        document.</t>
        <t>The process used to create NRPs and to allocate network resources
        for use by the NRPs needs to take a holistic view of the needs of all
        of the service provider's customers and to partition the resources
        accordingly. However, within an NRP, these resources can
        be managed via a dynamic control plane if required. This provides the required
        scalability and isolation with some flexibility.</t>

        <t>At the VPN service level, the required connectivity for a Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP)
        VPN service is usually full or partial mesh. To support such VPN
        services, the corresponding NRP also needs to provide MP2MP
        connectivity among the endpoints.</t>
        <t>Other service requirements may be expressed at different
        granularities, some of which can be applicable to the whole service
        while others may only be applicable to some pairs of endpoints.
        For example, when a particular level of performance guarantee is
        required, the point-to-point path through the underlying NRP of the
        enhanced VPN service may need to be specifically engineered to meet
        the required performance guarantee.</t>

        <t>VPNs are instantiated as overlays on top of an operator's network

        feature of overlays is that they can deliver services without placing

        <t>An enhanced VPN may need to install some additional state within
        the network to achieve the features that they require. Solutions need
        to take the scale of such state into consideration, and deployment
        architectures should constrain the number of enhanced VPN services so
        that the additional state introduced to the network is acceptable and
        under control. It is expected that the number of enhanced VPN services
        will be small at the beginning: even in the future, the number of
        enhanced VPN services will be fewer than conventional VPNs because
        existing VPN techniques are good enough to meet the needs of most
        existing VPN-type services.</t>
        <t>In general, it is not required that the state in the network be

        will usually be possible to aggregate a set or group of enhanced VPN
        services so that they share the same NRP and the same set of network
        resources (much in the same way that current VPNs are aggregated over
        transport tunnels) so that collections of enhanced VPN services that
        require the same behavior from the network in terms of resource
        reservation, latency bounds, resiliency, etc. can be grouped together.

      <name>Candidate Technologies</name>
      
      <t>A VPN is created by applying a demultiplexing technique to the
      underlying network (the underlay) to distinguish the traffic of one VPN
      from that of another. The connections of a VPN are supported by a set of
      underlay paths. Any path other than the shortest path through the
      underlay normally requires state to specify that path. The state of the
      paths could be applied to the underlay through the use of the RSVP-TE
      signaling protocol or directly through the use of a Software-Defined
      Networking (SDN) controller. Based on Segment Routing (SR), state could
      be maintained at the ingress node of the path and carried in the data
      packet. Other techniques may emerge as this problem is studied.  This
      state gets harder to manage as the number of paths increases.
      Furthermore, as we increase the coupling between the underlay and the
      overlay to support the enhanced VPN service, this state is likely to
      increase further. Through the use of NRP, a subset of underlay network
      resources can be either dedicated for a particular enhanced VPN service
      or shared among a group of enhanced VPN services. A group of underlay
      paths can be established using the common set of network resources of
      the NRP.</t>
      <t>This section describes the candidate technologies and examines them
      in the context of the different network planes that may be used together
      to build NRPs. <xref target="L2-DP" format="default"/> discusses the L2 packet-based
      or frame-based forwarding-plane mechanisms for resource partitioning.
      <xref target="NW-DP" format="default"/> discusses the corresponding encapsulation and
      forwarding mechanisms in the network layer. Non-packet data plane
      mechanisms are briefly discussed in <xref target="Non-Packet-DP" format="default"/>. The
      control plane and management plane mechanisms are discussed in Sections <xref target="control-plane" format="counter"/> and <xref target="management-plane" format="counter"/>, respectively.</t>

        <t>Several candidate L2 packet-based or frame-based forwarding-plane mechanisms that can provide the required traffic isolation and

        <section anchor="flexe" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Flex Ethernet</name>

	  <t>FlexE <xref target="FLEXE" format="default"/> provides the
	  ability to multiplex channels over an Ethernet link to create
	  point-to-point fixed-bandwidth connections in a way that provides
	  separation between enhanced VPN services. FlexE also supports
	  bonding multiple low-capacity links to create larger
	  links.</t>
	  <t>However, FlexE is only a link-level technology. When packets are
	  received by the downstream node, they need to be processed in a way
	  that preserves traffic isolation. In turn, this requires a queuing
	  and forwarding implementation that preserves the end-to-end
	  separation of enhanced VPNs.</t> <t>If different FlexE channels are
	  used for different services, then no sharing is possible between the
	  FlexE channels. Thus, it may be difficult to dynamically
	  redistribute unused bandwidth to lower priority services in another
	  FlexE channel. If one FlexE channel is used by one customer, the
	  customer can use some methods to manage the relative priority of
	  their own traffic in the FlexE channel.</t>

        <section anchor="dedicated-queues" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Dedicated Queues</name>
          <t>Diffserv-based queuing systems are described in <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC4594" format="default"/>. This approach is
          not sufficient to provide separation of enhanced VPN services
          because Diffserv does not provide enough markers to differentiate
          between traffic of a large number of enhanced VPN services.
          Additionally, Diffserv does not offer the range of service classes
          that each enhanced VPN service needs to provide to its tenants. This
          problem is particularly acute with an MPLS underlay because MPLS
          only provides eight traffic classes.</t>
          <t>In addition, Diffserv, as currently implemented, mainly provides
          per- hop priority-based scheduling, and it is difficult to use it to
          achieve quantitative resource reservation for different enhanced VPN
          services.</t>
          <t>To address these problems and to reduce the potential
          interactions between enhanced VPN services, it would be necessary to
          steer traffic to dedicated input and output queues per enhanced VPN
          service or per group of enhanced VPN services: some routers have a
          large number of queues and sophisticated queuing systems that could
          support this while some routers may struggle to provide the
          granularity and level of separation required by the applications of
          an enhanced VPN.</t>

          <name>Segment Routing</name>
          <t>SR <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/> is
          a method that prepends instructions to packets at the headend of a
          path. These instructions are used to specify the nodes and links to
          be traversed, and they allow the packets to be routed on paths other
          than the shortest path. By encoding the state in the packet,
          per-path state is transitioned out of the network. SR can be
          instantiated using the MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) (see <xref
          target="RFC8660" format="default"/>) or the IPv6 data plane (SRv6)
          (see <xref target="RFC8986" format="default"/>).</t>
          <t>An SR traffic-engineered path operates with the granularity of a
          link. Hints about priority are provided using the Traffic Class (TC)
          field in the packet header. However, to achieve the performance and
          isolation characteristics that are sought by enhanced VPN customers,
          it will be necessary to steer packets through specific virtual links
          and/or queues on the same link and direct them to use specific
          resources. With SR, it is possible to introduce such fine-grained
          packet steering by specifying the queues and the associated
          resources through an SR instruction list. One approach to do this is
          described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>Note that the concept of a queue is a useful abstraction for
          different types of underlay mechanisms that may be used to provide

          the requirement is implementation specific and is transparent to the
          L3 data plane and control plane mechanisms used.</t>
          <t>With SR, the SR instruction list could be used to
          build a P2P SR path. In addition, a group of SR Segment Identifiers
          (SIDs) could also be used to represent an MP2MP network. Thus, the
          SR-based mechanism could be used to provide both resource-reserved

        <t>As described in <xref target="architecture-and-components-of-vpn"/>, the enhanced VPN control plane needs to

        <t>Underlying network topology and resource
        information can be collected using mechanisms based on the existing IGP and Border Gateway
        Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) <xref target="RFC9552" format="default"/>. The creation of NRPs and the distribution of NRP

        <t>Two candidate control plane mechanisms for path setup in the NRP

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>RSVP-TE, as described in <xref target="RFC3209" format="default"/>, provides the signaling
            mechanism for establishing a TE-LSP in an MPLS network with
            end-to-end resource reservation. This can be seen as an approach
            of providing resource-reserved paths that could be used to bind
            the VPN to a specific set of network resources allocated within the

            capability of signaling resource reservations along the path. On
            the other hand, the SR approach provides a potential way of
            binding the underlay network resource and the NRPs without
            requiring per-path state to be maintained in the network. A
            centralized controller can perform resource planning and
            reservation for NRPs, and it needs to instruct the network nodes
            to ensure that resources are correctly allocated for the NRP. The
            controller could provision the SR paths based on the mechanism in

        <t>According to the service requirements for connectivity, performance,
        and isolation, one enhanced VPN service may be mapped to a dedicated
        NRP or a group of enhanced VPN services may be mapped to the same
        NRP. The mapping of enhanced VPN services to an NRP can be achieved using
        existing control mechanisms with possible extensions; it can be
        based on either the characteristics of the data packet or the
        attributes of the VPN service routes.</t>

      <section anchor="management-plane" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Management Plane</name>
        <t>The management plane provides the interface between the enhanced
        VPN service provider and the customers for life-cycle management of
        the enhanced VPN service (i.e., creation, modification,
        assurance/monitoring, and decommissioning). It relies on a set of
        service data models for the description of the information and
        operations needed on the interface.</t>


        <t>As an example, in the context of 5G end-to-end network slicing
        <xref target="TS28530" format="default"/>, the management of the
        transport network segment of the 5G end-to-end network slice can be
        realized with the management plane of the enhanced VPN. The 3GPP
        management system may provide the connectivity and performance-related
        parameters as requirements to the management plane of the transport
        network. It may also require the transport network to expose the
        capabilities and status of the network slice. Thus, the coordination
        of 5G end-to-end network slice management requires an interface
        between the enhanced VPN management plane and the 5G network slice
        management system, and relevant service data models.</t>
        <t>The management plane interface and data models for enhanced VPN
        services can be based on the service models described in <xref target="sdm-app" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>It is important that the life-cycle management support in-place
        modification of enhanced VPN services. That is, it should be possible
        to add and remove endpoints, as well as to change the requested
        characteristics of the service that is delivered. The management
        system needs to be able to assess the revised enhanced VPN requests
        and determine whether they can be provided by the existing NRPs or
        whether changes must be made. It will also need to
        determine whether those changes to the NRP are possible. If not, then
        the customer's modification request may be rejected.</t>
        <t>When the modification of an enhanced VPN service is possible, the
        management system must make every effort to make the changes in a
        non-disruptive way. That is, the modification of the enhanced VPN
        service or the underlying NRP must not perturb traffic on the enhanced
        VPN service in a way that causes the service level to drop below the
        agreed levels. Furthermore, changes to one enhanced VPN service should
        not cause disruption to other enhanced VPN services.</t>
        <t>The network operator for the underlay network (i.e., the provider
        of the enhanced VPN service) may delegate some operational aspects of
        the overlay VPN and the underlying NRP to the customer. In this way,
        the enhanced VPN is presented to the customer as a virtual network,
        and the customer can choose how to use that network. Some mechanisms
        in the operator's network are needed so that:</t>
	<ul>
	  <li>a customer cannot exceed
          the capabilities of the virtual links and nodes, but</li>
	  <li>it can decide how to
        load traffic onto the network, for example, by assigning different
        metrics to the virtual links so that the customer can control how
          traffic is routed through the virtual network.</li>
	</ul>
	<t>This approach requires
        a management system for the virtual network but does not necessarily
        require any coordination between the management systems of the virtual
        network and the physical network, except that the virtual network
        management system might notice when the NRP is close to capacity or
        considerably under-used and automatically request changes in the
        service provided by the underlay network.</t>

        of network and VPN services. Augmentation to these service models may
        be needed to provide the enhanced VPN services. The NRP model in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-nrp-yang" format="default"/> further provides the management of

        planning policy, or based on the requirements of one or a group of

        requirements of network slice services. One of the basic requirements
        for the NRP is to provide a set of dedicated network resources to
        avoid unexpected interference from other services in the same network.
        Other possible requirements may include the required topology and
        connectivity, bandwidth, latency, reliability, etc.</t>
        <t>A centralized network controller can be responsible for calculating
        a subset of the underlay network topology (which is called a logical

        links within the logical topology, the set of network resources to be

        Normally, such calculation needs to take the underlay network
        connectivity information and the available network resource
        information of the underlay network into consideration. The network

      <name>Scalability Considerations</name>
      <t>NRP-based enhanced VPNs provide performance guaranteed services in
      packet networks; however, this comes with the potential cost of introducing additional
      state into the network. There are at least three ways that this
      additional state might be added:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>by introducing the complete state into the packet, as is done in SR.
          This allows the controller to specify the detailed series of
          forwarding and processing instructions for the packet as it transits
          the network. The cost of this is an increase in the packet header
          size. A further cost is that systems will have to provide NRP-specific segments in case they are called upon by a service. This is
          a type of latent state, and it increases as the segments and resources
          that need to be exclusively available to enhanced VPN service are
          specified more precisely.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>by introducing the state to the network. This is normally done by
          creating a path using signaling such as RSVP-TE. This could be
          extended to include any element that needs to be specified along the
          path, for example, explicitly specifying queuing policy. It is also
          possible to use other methods to introduce path state, such as via
          an SDN controller or possibly by modifying a routing protocol. With
          this approach, there is state per path: a per-path characteristic that
          needs to be maintained over the life of the path. This is more
          network state than is needed using SR, but the packets are usually
          shorter.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>by providing a hybrid approach. One example is based on using binding
          SIDs (see <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>) to represent path fragments and binding
          them together with SR. Dynamic creation of a VPN service path using
          SR requires less state maintenance in the network core at the
          expense of larger packet headers. The packet size can be lower if a
          form of loose source routing is used (using a few nodal SIDs), and
          it will be lower if no specific functions or resources on the
          routers are specified. For Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6), the packet size may also be reduced
          by utilizing the compression techniques specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression" format="default"/>.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <t>Reducing the state in the network is important to the deployment of
      enhanced VPNs, as they require the overlay to be more closely integrated
      with the underlay than with conventional VPNs. This tighter coupling
      would normally mean that more state needs to be created and maintained
      in the network, as state about fine-granularity processing would need to
      be loaded and maintained in the routers. Aggregation is a
      well-established approach to reduce the amount of state and improve
      scaling, and NRP is considered to be the network construct to aggregate
      the states of enhanced VPN services.  In addition, an SR approach allows
      much of the state to be spread amongst the network ingress nodes and
      transiently carried in the packets as SIDs.</t>
      <t>The following subsections describe some of the scalability concerns
      that need to be considered. Further discussion of the scalability

        been concerns that this requires significant continuous state
        maintenance in the network. Work to improve the scalability of RSVP-TE

        <name>SDN Scaling</name>


        <t>The centralized SDN-based approach requires control plane state to be
        stored in the network, but can reduce the overhead of control channels
        to be maintained. Each individual network node may need to maintain a
        control channel with an SDN controller, which is considered more
        scalable compared to the need of maintaining control channels with a
        set of neighbor nodes.</t>
        <t>However, SDN may transfer some of the scalability concerns from the
        network to a centralized controller. In particular, there may be a
        heavy processing burden at the controller and a heavy load in the
        network surrounding the controller. A centralized controller may also
        present a single point of failure within the network.</t>

    <section anchor="enhanced-resiliency" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Enhanced Resiliency</name>
      <t>Each enhanced VPN service has a life cycle and may need modification
      during deployment as the needs of its tenant change (see <xref target="management-plane" format="default"/>). Additionally, as the network
      evolves, garbage collection may need to be performed to consolidate
      resources into usable quanta.</t>
      <t>Systems in which the path is imposed, such as SR or some form of
      explicit routing, tend to do well in these applications because it is
      possible to perform an atomic transition from one path to another. That
      is, a single action by the headend that changes the path without the
      need for coordinated action by the routers along the path. However,
      implementations and the monitoring protocols need to make sure that the
      new path is operational and meets the required SLA before traffic is
      transitioned to it. It is possible for deadlocks to arise as a result of
      the network becoming fragmented over time, such that it is impossible to
      create a new path or to modify an existing path without impacting the
      SLA of other paths. The global concurrent optimization mechanisms as
      described in <xref target="RFC5557" format="default"/> and discussed in
      <xref target="RFC7399" format="default"/> may be helpful, while complete
      resolution of this situation is as much a commercial issue as it is a
      technical issue.</t>
      <t>However, there are two manifestations of the latency problem that
      are for further study in any of these approaches:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Packets overtaking one another if path latency
          reduces during a transition.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Transient variation in latency in either direction
          as a path migrates.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>There is also the matter of what happens during failure in the
      underlay infrastructure. Fast reroute is one approach, but that still
      produces a transient loss with a normal goal of rectifying this within
      50 ms <xref target="RFC5654" format="default"/>. An alternative is some form of N+1
      delivery such as has been used for many years to support protection from
      service disruption. This may be taken to a different level using the
      techniques of DetNet with multiple in-network replications and the
      culling of later packets <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>In addition to the approach used to protect high-priority packets,
      consideration should be given to the impact of best-effort traffic on
      the high-priority packets during a transition. Specifically, if a
      conventional re-convergence process is used, there will inevitably be
      micro-loops and, while some form of explicit routing will protect the
      high-priority traffic, lower-priority traffic on best-effort shortest
      paths will micro-loop without the use of a loop-prevention technology.
      To provide the highest quality of service to high-priority traffic,
      either this traffic must be shielded from the micro-loops or
      micro-loops must be prevented completely.</t>

      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>It is expected that NRP-based enhanced VPN services will be
      introduced in networks that already have conventional VPN services
      deployed. Depending on service requirements, the tenants or the operator
      may choose to use a VPN or an enhanced VPN to fulfill a service
      requirement. The information and parameters to assist such a decision
      needs to be supplied on the management interface between the tenant and
      the operator. The management interface and data models (as described in
      <xref target="sdm-app" format="default"/>) can be used for the life-cycle management of
      enhanced VPN services, such as service creation, modification,
      performance monitoring, and decommissioning.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>All types of virtual networks require special consideration to be
      given to the isolation of traffic belonging to different tenants. That
      is, traffic belonging to one VPN must not be delivered to endpoints
      outside that VPN. In this regard, the enhanced VPN neither introduces
      nor experiences greater security risks than other VPNs.</t>
      <t>However, in an enhanced VPN service, the additional service
      requirements need to be considered. For example, if a service requires a
      specific upper bound to latency, then it can be damaged by simply
      delaying the packets through the activities of another tenant, i.e., by
      introducing bursts of traffic for other services. In some respects, this
      makes the enhanced VPN more susceptible to attacks since the SLA may be
      broken. Another view is that the operator must, in any case, preform
      monitoring of the enhanced VPN to ensure that the SLA is met; thus, the operator may be more likely to spot the early onset of a
      security attack and be able to take preemptive protective action.</t>
      <t>The measures to address these dynamic security risks must be
      specified as part of the specific solution to the isolation requirements
      of an enhanced VPN service.</t>
      <t>While an enhanced VPN service may be sold as offering encryption and
      other security features as part of the service, customers would be well
      advised to take responsibility for their security requirements
      themselves, possibly by encrypting traffic before handing it off to the
      service provider.</t>
      <t>The privacy of enhanced VPN service customers must be preserved. It
      should not be possible for one customer to discover the existence of
      another customer nor should the sites that are members of an enhanced
      VPN be externally visible.</t>
      <t>An enhanced VPN service (even one with traffic isolation requirements
      or with limited interaction with other enhanced VPNs) does not provide
      any additional guarantees of privacy for customer traffic compared to
      regular VPNs: the traffic within the network may be intercepted and
      errors may lead to mis-delivery. Users who wish to ensure the privacy of
      their traffic must take their own precautions including end-to-end
      encryption.</t>
