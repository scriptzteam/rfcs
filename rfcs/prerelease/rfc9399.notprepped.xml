      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This specification supplements <xref target="RFC5280"/>, which profiles
public key certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) for use in
the Internet, and it supplements <xref target="RFC5755"/>, which profiles
attribute certificates for use in the Internet.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC3709"/> and <xref target="RFC6170"/>.
<xref target="changes"/> provides a summary of the changes since the publication of
<xref target="RFC3709"/> and <xref target="RFC6170"/>.</t>
      <t>The basic function of a certificate is to bind a public key to the
identity of an entity (the subject).  From a strictly technical
viewpoint, this goal could be achieved by signing the identity of the
subject together with its public key.  However, the art of Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) has developed certificates far beyond this
functionality in order to meet the needs of modern global networks and
heterogeneous information and operational technology structures.</t>
      <t>Certificate users must be able to determine certificate policies,
appropriate key usage, assurance level, and name form constraints.
Before a relying party can make an informed decision whether a
particular certificate is trustworthy and relevant for its intended
usage, a certificate may be examined from several different
perspectives.</t>
      <t>Systematic processing is necessary to determine whether a particular
certificate meets the predefined prerequisites for an intended usage.
Much of the information contained in certificates is appropriate and
effective for machine processing; however, this information is not
suitable for a corresponding human trust and recognition process.</t>
<t>Humans prefer to structure information into categories and
symbols.  Most humans associate complex structures of reality with easily
recognizable logotypes and marks.  Humans tend to trust things that
they recognize from previous experiences.  Humans may examine
information to confirm their initial reaction.  Very few consumers
   actually read all terms and conditions they agree to in accepting a
   service; instead, they commonly act on trust derived from previous
   experience and recognition.</t>
      <t>A big part of this process is branding.  Service providers and product
vendors invest a lot of money and resources into creating a strong
relation between positive user experiences and easily recognizable
trademarks, servicemarks, and logotypes.</t>
      <t>Branding is also pervasive in identification instruments, including
identification cards, passports, driver's licenses, credit cards,
gasoline cards, and loyalty cards.  Identification instruments are
intended to identify the holder as a particular person or as a member
of the community.  The community may represent the subscribers of a
service or any other group.  Identification instruments, in physical
form, commonly use logotypes and symbols, solely to enhance human
recognition and trust in the identification instrument itself.  They
may also include a registered trademark to allow legal recourse for
unauthorized duplication.</t>
      <t>Since certificates play an equivalent role in electronic exchanges,
we examine the inclusion of logotypes in certificates.  We consider
certificate-based identification and certificate selection.</t>
      <section anchor="cert-ident">
        <name>Certificate-Based Identification</name>
        <t>The need for human recognition depends on the manner in which
certificates are used and whether certificates need to be visible to
human users.  If certificates are to be used in open environments and
in applications that bring the user in conscious contact with the
result of a certificate-based identification process, then human
recognition is highly relevant and may be a necessity.</t>
        <t>Examples of such applications include:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Web server identification where a user identifies the owner
of the website.</li>
          <li>Peer email exchange in business-to-business (B2B),
business-to-consumer (B2C), and private communications.</li>
          <li>Exchange of medical records and system for medical prescriptions.</li>
          <li>Unstructured e-business applications (i.e., non-EDI applications).</li>
          <li>Wireless client authenticating to a service provider.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Most applications provide the human user with an opportunity to view
the results of a successful certificate-based identification
process.  When the user takes the steps necessary to view these results,
the
user is presented with a view of a certificate.  This solution has two
major problems.  First, the function to view a certificate is often
rather hard to find for a non-technical user.  Second, the
presentation of the certificate is too technical and is not user
friendly.  It contains no graphic symbols or logotypes to enhance
human recognition.</t>
        <t>Many investigations have shown that users of today's applications do
not take the steps necessary to view certificates.  This could be due
to poor user interfaces.  Further, many applications are structured to
hide certificates from users.  The application designers do not want
to expose certificates to users at all.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="cert-select">
        <name>Selection of Certificates</name>
        <t>One situation where software applications must expose human users to
certificates is when the user must select a single certificate from a
portfolio of certificates.  In some cases, the software application
can use information within the certificates to filter the list for
suitability; however, the user must be queried if more than one
certificate is suitable.  The human user must select one of them.</t>
        <t>This situation is comparable to a person selecting a suitable plastic
card from their wallet.  In this situation, substantial assistance is
provided by card color, location, and branding.</t>
        <t>In order to provide similar support for certificate selection, the
users need tools to easily recognize and distinguish
certificates.  Introduction of logotypes into certificates provides
the necessary graphic.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="cert-combo">
        <name>Combination of Verification Techniques</name>
        <t>The use of logotypes will, in many cases, affect the user's decision to
trust and use a certificate.  It is therefore important that there be
a distinct and clear architectural and functional distinction between
the processes and objectives of the automated certificate
verification and human recognition.</t>
        <t>Since logotypes are only aimed for human interpretation and contain
data that is inappropriate for computer-based verification schemes,
the logotype certificate extension <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be an active component in automated
certification path validation, as specified in <xref section="6" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC5280"/>.</t>
        <t>Automated certification path verification determines whether the
end entity certificate can be verified according to defined
policy.  The algorithm for this verification is specified in <xref target="RFC5280"/>.</t>
        <t>The automated processing provides assurance that the certificate is
valid.  It does not indicate whether the subject is entitled to any
particular information or whether the subject ought to be trusted to
perform a particular service.  These are authorization
decisions.  Automatic processing will make some authorization decisions,
but others, depending on the application context, involve the human user.</t>
        <t>In some situations, where automated procedures have failed to
establish the suitability of the certificate to the task, the human
user is the final arbitrator of the post certificate verification
authorization decisions.  In the end, the human will decide whether
or not to accept an executable email attachment, to release personal
information, or to follow the instructions displayed by a web browser.
This decision will often be based on recognition and previous
experience.</t>
        <t>The distinction between systematic processing and human processing is
rather straightforward.  They can be complementary.  While the
systematic process is focused on certification path construction and
verification, the human acceptance process is focused on recognition
and related previous experience.</t>
        <t>There are some situations where systematic processing and human
processing interfere with each other.  These issues are discussed in
the <xref target="sec-cons"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="logotypes">
      <name>Different Types of Logotypes in Certificates</name>
      <t>This specification defines the inclusion of three standard logotype types:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>community logotype</li>
        <li>issuer organization logotype</li>
        <li>subject organization logotype</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The community logotype is the general mark for a community.  It
identifies a service concept for entity identification and
certificate issuance.  Many issuers may use a community logotype to
co-brand with a global community in order to gain global recognition
of its local service provision.  This type of community branding is
very common in the credit card business, where local independent card
issuers include a globally recognized brand (such as Visa and
Mastercard).  Certificate issuers may include more than one community
logotype to indicate participation in more than one global community.</t>
      <t>The issuer organization logotype is a logotype representing the
organization identified as part of the issuer name in the
certificate.</t>
      <t>The subject organization logotype is a logotype representing the
organization identified in the subject name in the certificate.</t>
      <t>In addition to the standard logotype types, this specification
accommodates inclusion of other logotype types where each class of
logotype is defined by an object identifier.  The object identifier
can be either locally defined or an identifier defined in <xref target="extn-other"/>
of this document.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="logotype-data">
      <name>Logotype Data</name>
      <t>This specification defines two types of logotype data: image data and
audio data.  Implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support image data; however, support
for audio data is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.</t>
      <t>Image and audio data for logotypes can be provided by reference by including
a URI that identifies the location to the logotype data and a one-way hash
of the referenced data in the certificate.  The privacy-related properties
for remote logotype data depend on four parties: the certificate relying
parties that use the information in the certificate extension to fetch
the logotype data, the certificate issuers that populate the certificate
extension, certificate subscribers that request certificates that include
the certificate extension, and server operators that provide the logotype
data.</t>
      <t>Alternatively, embedding the logotype data  in the certificate with direct
addressing (as defined in <xref target="embedded-image"/>) provides improved privacy
properties and depends upon fewer parties.  However, this approach can
significantly increase the size of the certificate.</t>
      <t>Several image objects, representing the same visual content in different
formats, sizes, and color palates, may represent each logotype image.  At
least one of the image objects representing a logotype <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> contain an
image with a width between 60 pixels and 200 pixels and a height between
45 pixels and 150 pixels.</t>
      <t>Several instances of audio data may further represent the same audio
sequence in different formats, resolutions, and languages.  At least one
of the audio objects representing a logotype <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide text-based
audio data suitable for processing by text-to-speech software.</t>
      <t>A typical use of text-based audio data is inclusion in web applications where the
audio text is placed as the "alt" attribute value of an HTML image (img) element,
and the language value obtained from LogotypeAudioInfo is included as the "lang"
attribute of that image.</t>
      <t>If a logotype of a certain type (as defined in <xref target="logotypes"/>) is
represented by more than one image object, then each image object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
contain variants of roughly the same visual content.  Likewise, if a
logotype of a certain type is represented by more than one audio object,
then the audio objects <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain variants of the same audio information.
A spoken message in different languages is considered a variation of
the same audio information.  When more than one image object or more than
one audio object  for the same logotype type is included in the certificate,
the certificate issuer is responsible for ensuring that the objects contain
roughly the same content.  Compliant applications <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> display more than
one of the image objects and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> play more than one of the audio objects
for any logotype type (see <xref target="logotypes"/>) at the same time.</t>
      <t>A client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> simultaneously display multiple logotypes of different
logotype types.  For example, it may display one subject organization
logotype while also displaying a community logotype, but it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
display multiple image variants of the same community logotype.</t>
      <t>Each logotype present in a certificate <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be represented by at
least one image data object.</t>
      <t>Client applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> enhance processing and off-line
functionality by caching logotype data.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="extn">
      <name>Logotype Certificate Extension</name>
      <t>This section specifies the syntax and semantics of the logotype
certificate extension.</t>
      <section anchor="extn-format">
        <name>Extension Format</name>
        <t>The logotype certificate extension <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be included in public key certificates
<xref target="RFC5280"/> or attribute certificates <xref target="RFC5755"/>.
The logotype certificate extension <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be identified by the following object
identifier:</t>

        <sourcecode type="asn.1"><![CDATA[
   id-pe-logotype  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=
      { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
        security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-pe(1) 12 }
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>This extension <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be marked critical.</t>
        <t>Logotype data may be referenced through either direct or indirect
addressing.  Client applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support both direct and indirect
addressing.  Certificate issuing applications <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support direct
addressing, and certificate issuing applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support
indirect addressing.</t>
        <t>The direct addressing includes information about each logotype in the
certificate, and URIs point to the image and audio data object.  Multiple
URIs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be included for locations for obtaining the same logotype object.
Multiple hash values <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be included, each computed with a different
one-way hash function.  Direct addressing supports cases where just
one or a few alternative images and audio objects are referenced.</t>
        <t>The indirect addressing includes one or more references to an external
hashed data structure that contains information on the type, content, and
location of each image and audio object.  Indirect addressing supports
cases where each logotype is represented by many alternative audio or
image objects.</t>
<t>Both direct and indirect addressing accommodate alternative URIs to
obtain exactly the same logotype data.  This opportunity for replication is
intended to improve availability.  Therefore, if a client is unable to
fetch the item from one URI, the client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> try another URI in the
sequence.  All direct addressing URIs <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the HTTPS scheme (https://...),
the HTTP scheme (http://...), or the DATA scheme (data://...) <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
However, the "data" URI scheme <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used with the indirect addressing.
Clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support retrieval of the referenced LogotypeData with 
HTTP <xref target="RFC9110"/>, HTTP with TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, or subsequent versions of
these protocols.  Client applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also support the "data" URI
scheme <xref target="RFC2397"/> for direct addressing with embedded logotype data
within the extension.</t>
        <t>Note that the HTTPS scheme (https://...) requires the validation of other
certificates to establish a secure connection.  For this reason, the
HTTP scheme (http://...) may be easier for a client to handle.  Also, the
hash of the logotype data provides data integrity.</t>
        <t>The logotype certificate extension <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the following syntax:</t>

then the referenced image <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be scaled to fit within the size parameters
of LogotypeImageInfo while preserving the x and y ratio.  Dithering may
produce a more appropriate image than linear scaling.</t>

of a certificate by providing meaningful visual information to the
user interface (UI).  The logotype certificate extension <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain more
than one certificate image logotype.</t>
          <t>Typical situations when a human needs to examine
the visual representation of a certificate are:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>A person establishes a secured channel with an authenticated
service.  The person needs to determine the identity of the
service based on the authenticated credentials.</li>
            <li>A person validates the signature on critical information, such as
signed executable code, and needs to determine the identity of the
signer based on the signer's certificate.</li>
            <li>A person is required to select an appropriate certificate to be
used when authenticating to a service or identity management
infrastructure.  The person needs to see the available
certificates in order to distinguish between them in the selection
process.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>The display of certificate information to humans is challenging due
to lack of well-defined semantics for critical identity attributes.
Unless the application has out-of-band knowledge about a particular
certificate, the application will not know the exact nature of the
data stored in common identification attributes, such as serialNumber,
organizationName, country, etc.  Consequently, the application can
display the actual data but faces the problem of labeling that data
in the UI and informing the human about the exact nature (semantics)
of that data.  It is also challenging for the application to
determine which identification attributes are important to display
and how to organize them in a logical order.</t>
          <t>When present, the certificate image <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a complete visual
representation of the certificate.  This means that the display of
this certificate image represents all information about the
certificate that the issuer subjectively defines as relevant to show
to a typical human user within the typical intended use of the
certificate, giving adequate information about at least the following
	  three aspects of the certificate:</t>

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>certificate context</li>
            <li>certificate issuer</li>
            <li>certificate subject</li>
          </ul>
          <t>Certificate context information is visual marks and/or textual
information that helps the typical user to understand the typical
usage and/or purpose of the certificate.</t>
          <t>It is up to the issuer to decide what information -- in the form of
text, graphical symbols, and elements -- represents a complete visual
representation of the certificate.  However, the visual
representation of certificate subject and certificate issuer
information from the certificate <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the same meaning as the
textual representation of that information in the certificate itself.</t>
          <t>Applications providing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the
certificate user <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> present a certificate image as the only visual
representation of a certificate; however, the certificate user <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
be able to easily obtain the details of the certificate content.</t>

      <t>Logotypes <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be included in public key certificates and attribute

relying party <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the logotypes as part of certification path

      <name>Use in Clients</name>
      <t>All PKI implementations require relying party software to have some
mechanism to determine whether a trusted CA issues a particular
certificate.  This is an issue for certification path validation,
including consistent policy and name checking.</t>
      <t>After a certification path is successfully validated, the replying
party trusts the information that the CA includes in the certificate,
including any certificate extensions.  The client software can choose
to make use of such information, or the client software can ignore
it.     If the client is unable to support a provided logotype, the
   client <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> report an error; instead, the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> behave as
   though no logotype certificate extension was included in the certificate.  Current standards
do not provide any mechanism for cross-certifying CAs to constrain
subordinate CAs from including private extensions (see <xref target="sec-cons"/>).</t>
      <t>Consequently, if relying party software accepts a CA, then it should
be prepared to (unquestioningly) display the associated logotypes to
its human user, given that it is configured to do so.  Information
about the logotypes is provided so that the replying party software
can select the one that will best meet the needs of the human
user.  This choice depends on the abilities of the human user, as well as
the
capabilities of the platform on which the replaying party software is
running.  If none of the provided logotypes meets the needs of the
human user or matches the capabilities of the platform, then the
logotypes can be ignored.</t>
      <t>A client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>, subject to local policy, choose to display none, one, or
any number of the logotypes in the logotype certificate extension.  In many cases,
a client will be used in an environment with a good
network connection and also used in an environment with little or no
network connectivity.  For example, a laptop computer can be docked
with a high-speed LAN connection, or it can be disconnected from the
network altogether.  In recognition of this situation, the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
include the ability to disable the fetching of logotypes.  However,
locally cached logotypes can still be displayed when the user
disables the fetching of additional logotypes.</t>
      <t>A client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>, subject to local policy, choose any combination of
audio and image presentation for each logotype.  That is, the client
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> display an image with or without playing a sound, and it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> play
a sound with or without displaying an image.  A client <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> play
more than one logotype audio sequence at the same time.</t>
      <t>The logotype is to be displayed in conjunction with other identity
information contained in the certificate.  The logotype is not a
replacement for this identity information.</t>
      <t>Care is needed when designing replying party software to ensure that an
appropriate context of logotype information is provided.  This is
especially difficult with audio logotypes.  It is important that the
human user be able to recognize the context of the logotype, even if
other audio streams are being played.</t>
      <t>If the relying party software is unable to successfully validate a
particular certificate, then it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> display any logotype data
associated with that certificate.</t>

      <t>Implementations that simultaneously display multiple logotype types
(subject organization, issuer organization, community, or other) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that
there is no ambiguity as to the binding between the image and the
type of logotype that the image represents.  "Logotype type" is
defined in <xref target="cert-ident"/>, and it refers to the type
of entity or affiliation represented by the logotype, not the
of binary format of the image or audio.</t>
      <t>Logotypes are very difficult to securely and accurately define.  Names
are also difficult in this regard, but logotypes are even worse.  It
is quite difficult to specify what is, and what is not, a legitimate
logotype of an organization.  There is an entire legal structure around
this issue, and it will not be repeated here.  However, issuers should
be aware of the implications of including images associated with a
trademark or servicemark before doing so.  As logotypes can be
difficult (and sometimes expensive) to verify, the possibility of errors
related to assigning wrong logotypes to organizations is increased.</t>
      <t>This is not a new issue for electronic identification instruments.  It
is already dealt with in a number of similar situations in the
physical world, including physical employee identification cards.  In
addition, there are situations where identification of logotypes is
rather simple and straightforward, such as logotypes for well-known
industries and institutes.  These issues should not stop those service
providers who want to issue logotypes from doing so, where relevant.</t>
      <t>It is impossible to prevent fraudulent creation of certificates by
dishonest or badly performing issuers, containing names and logotypes
that the issuer has no claim to or has failed to check correctly.  Such
certificates could be created in an attempt to socially engineer a user
into accepting a certificate.  The premise used for the logotype work is
thus that logotype graphics in a certificate are trusted only if the
certificate is successfully validated within a valid path.  It is thus
imperative that the representation of any certificate that fails to
validate is not enhanced in any way by using the logotype data.</t>
      <t>This underlines the necessity for CAs to provide reliable services
and the relying party's responsibility and need to carefully select
which CAs are trusted to provide public key certificates.</t>
      <t>This also underlines the general necessity for relying parties to use
up-to-date software libraries to render or dereference data from
external sources, including logotype data in certificates, to minimize
risks related to processing potentially malicious data before it has been
adequately verified and validated.  Implementers should review the guidance
in <xref section="7" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
      <t>Referenced image objects are hashed in order to bind the image to the
signature of the certificate.  Some image types, such as SVG, allow
part of the image to be collected from an external source by
incorporating a reference to an external file that contains the image.  If
this feature were used within a logotype image, the hash of the image
would only cover the URI reference to the external image file but
not the referenced image data.  Clients <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> verify that SVG
images meet all requirements listed in <xref target="image-format"/> and reject
images that contain references to external data.</t>
      <t>CAs issuing certificates with embedded logotype images should be
cautious when accepting graphics from the certificate requester for
inclusion in the certificate if the hash algorithm used to sign the
certificate is vulnerable to collision attacks, as described in <xref target="RFC6151"/>.  In
such a case, the accepted image may contain data that could help an
attacker to obtain colliding certificates with identical certificate
signatures.</t>
      <t>Certification paths may also impose name constraints that are
systematically checked during certification path processing, which,
in theory, may be circumvented by logotypes.</t>
      <t>Certificate path processing, as defined in <xref target="RFC5280"/>, does not constrain
the inclusion of logotype data in certificates.  A parent CA can
constrain certification path validation such that subordinate CAs cannot
issue valid certificates to end entities outside a limited name space or
outside specific certificate policies.  A malicious CA can comply with
these name and policy requirements and still include inappropriate
logotypes in the certificates that it issues.  These certificates will
pass the certification path validation algorithm, which means the client
will trust the logotypes in the certificates.  Since there is no
technical mechanism to prevent or control subordinate CAs from including
the logotype certificate extension or its contents, where appropriate, a parent CA
could employ a legal agreement to impose a suitable restriction on the
subordinate CA.  This situation is not unique to the logotype certificate extension.</t>
      <t>When a relying party fetches remote logotype data, a mismatch between the
media type provided in the mediaType field of the LogotypeDetails and the
Content-Type HTTP header of the retrieved object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be treated as a
failure, and the fetched logotype data should not be presented to the
user.  However, if more than one location for the remote logotype data is
provided in the certificate extension, the relying party <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> try to fetch
the remote logotype data from an alternate location to resolve the failure.</t>
      <t>When a subscriber requests the inclusion of remote logotype data in a
certificate, the CA cannot be sure that any logotype data will be
available at the provided URI for the entire validity period of the
certificate.  To mitigate this concern, the CA may provide the logotype
data from a server under its control, rather than a subscriber-controlled
server.</t>
      <t>The controls available to a parent CA to protect itself from rogue
subordinate CAs are non-technical.  They include:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Contractual agreements of suitable behavior, including
terms of liability in case of material breach.</li>
        <li>Control mechanisms and procedures to monitor and follow the behavior of
subordinate CAs, including Certificate Transparency <xref target="RFC9162"/>.</li>
        <li>Use of certificate policies to declare an assurance level
of logotype data, as well as to guide applications on how
to treat and display logotypes.</li>
        <li>Use of revocation functions to revoke any misbehaving CA.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>There is not a simple, straightforward, and absolute technical
solution.  Rather, involved parties must settle some aspects of PKI
outside the scope of technical controls.  As such, issuers need to
clearly identify and communicate the associated risks.</t>

      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>Certificates are commonly public objects, so the inclusion of
privacy-sensitive information in certificates should be avoided.  The more
information that is included in a certificate, the greater the likelihood
that the certificate will reveal privacy-sensitive information.  The
inclusion of logotype data needs to be considered in this context.</t>
      <t>Logotype data might be fetched from a server when it is needed.  By
watching activity on the network, an observer can determine which clients
are making use of certificates that contain particular logotype data.
Since clients are expected to locally cache logotype data, network
traffic to the server containing the logotype data will not be generated
every time the certificate is used.  Further, when logotype data is not
cached, activity on the network might reveal certificate usage frequency.
Even when logotype data is cached, regardless of whether direct or
indirect addressing is employed, network traffic monitoring could reveal
when logotype data is fetched for the first time.  Implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
encrypt fetches of logotype data using HTTPS, padding the data to a common
size to reduce visibility into the data that is being fetched.  Likewise,
servers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> reduce visibility into the data that is being returned by
encrypting with HTTPS and padding to a few common sizes.</t>
      <t>Similarly, when fetching logotype data from a server, the server operator
can determine which clients are making use of certificates that contain
particular logotype data.  As above, locally caching logotype data will
eliminate the need to fetch the logotype data each time the certificate
is used, and lack of caching would reveal usage frequency.  Even when
implementations cache logotype data, regardless of whether direct or
indirect addressing is employed, the server operator could observe when
logotype data is fetched for the first time.</t>
<t>In addition, the use of an encrypted DNS mechanism, such as DNS over TLS (DoT) <xref target="RFC7858"/>
or DNS over HTTPS (DoH) <xref target="RFC9230"/>, hides the name resolution traffic, which is usually a first step in fetching
remote logotype objects.</t>
      <t>When the "data" URI scheme is used with direct addressing, there is no
network traffic to fetch logotype data, which avoids the observations of
network traffic or server operations described above.  To obtain this
benefit, the certificate will be larger than one that contains a URL.
Due to the improved privacy posture, the "data" URI scheme with direct
addressing will be the only one that is supported by some CAs.
Privacy-aware certificate subscribers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> wish to insist that logotype
data is embedded in the certificate with the "data" URI scheme with
direct addressing.</t>
      <t>In cases where logotype data is cached by the relying party, the cache
index should include the hash values of the associated logotype data with the
goal of fetching the logotype data only once, even when it is referenced by
multiple URIs.  The index should include hash values for all supported
hash algorithms.  The cached data should include the media type as well as
the logotype data.  Implementations should give preference to logotype data
that is already in the cache when multiple alternatives are offered in the
LogotypeExtn certificate extension.</t>
      <t>When the "data" URI scheme is used, the relying party <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> add the embedded
logotype data to the local cache, which could avoid the need to fetch the
logotype data if it is referenced by a URL in another certificate.</t>
      <t>When fetching remote logotype data, relying parties should use the most
privacy-preserving options that are available to minimize the opportunities
for servers to "fingerprint" clients. For example, avoid cookies, ETags, and
client certificates.</t>
      <t>When a relying party encounters a new certificate, the lack of network traffic
to fetch logotype data might indicate that a certificate with references to the
same logotype data has been previously processed and cached.</t>
      <t>TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/> includes the ability to encrypt the server's certificate
in the TLS handshake, which helps hide the server's identity from anyone that
is watching activity on the network.  If the server's certificate includes
remote logotype data, the client fetching that data might disclose the
otherwise protected server identity.</t>

        <name>ASN.1 Module with 2002 Syntax</name>
        <t>Some developers like to use the latest version of ASN.1 standards.  This
appendix provides an ASN.1 module to assist in that goal.  It uses the ASN.1
syntax defined in <xref target="NEW-ASN1"/>, and it follows the conventions
established in <xref target="RFC5912"/> and <xref target="RFC6268"/>.</t>
        <t>This ASN.1 module incorporates the module from <xref target="RFC3709"/> and the module
from <xref target="RFC6170"/>.</t>
        <t>Note that <xref target="NEW-ASN1"/> was published in 2021, and all of the features
used in this module are backward compatible with the specification
that was published in 2002.</t>

        <name>Full Certificate Example</name>
        <t>The following example contains a certificate for Alice; it is
essentially a renewal of the certificate that appears in <xref target="RFC9216"/>.
Of course, the serial number and issue dates are different.  In
addition, Alice's certificate now has a logotype certificate extension.  The
extension contains URLs for two community logotype images, both at
fictional URLs.  The extension also contains URLs for two subject
organization logotype images, both at fictional URLs.  An implementation would
display at most three of these images, both of the community logotype
images and one of the subject organization logotype images.  Direct addressing is
used for all of the images, and the images are hashed by SHA-256.</t>

      <name>Changes since RFCs 3709 and 6170</name>
      <t>This appendix summarizes the changes since <xref target="RFC3709"/>.  The changes are:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Combine RFCs 3709 and 6170 into one document, and encourage
implementers to support the "data" URI scheme (data:...) that was
originally specified in RFC 6170.  Merging RFCs 3709 and 6170 led
to many editorial changes throughout the document.</li>
        <li>Drop SHA-1 as the mandatory-to-implement hash algorithm, and encourage
use of the one-way hash function that is employed by the certificate
signature algorithm.</li>
        <li>RFC 3709 required client applications to support both direct and indirect
addressing.  This requirement is changed to <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support both direct and
indirect addressing to allow implementations to be more privacy preserving.</li>
        <li>Update the reference for language tags to be RFC 5646 instead of
the now obsolete RFC 3066.</li>
        <li>Update the reference for the URI Generic Syntax to be RFC 3986 instead
of the now obsolete RFC 2396.</li>
