    <abstract>
      <t>There is a false notion that Internet Number Resources (INRs) in
    the RPKI can be associated with the real-world identity of the
    'holder' of an INR.  This document specifies that RPKI does not
    associate to the INR holder.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), see <xref target="RFC6480"/>, "represents the allocation hierarchy of IP
    address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers," which are
    collectively known as Internet Number Resources (INRs).  Since
    initial deployment, the RPKI has grown to include other similar
    resource and routing data, e.g., Router Keying for BGPsec <xref target="RFC8635"/>.</t>
      <t>In security terms, the phrase "Public Key" implies there is also
    a corresponding private key <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  The RPKI
    provides strong authority to the current holder of INRs; however,
    some people have a desire to use RPKI private keys to sign
    arbitrary documents as the INR 'holder' of those resources with the
    inappropriate expectation that the signature will be considered an
    attestation to the authenticity of the document content.  But, in
    reality, the RPKI certificate is only an authorization to speak for
    the explicitly identified INRs; it is explicitly not intended for
    authentication of the 'holders' of the INRs.  This situation is
    emphasized in <xref target="RFC6480" section="2.1" sectionFormat="of"/>.</t>
      <t>It has been suggested that one could authenticate real-world
    business transactions with the signatures of INR holders.  For example,
    Bill's Bait and Sushi (BB&amp;S) could use the private key attesting
    to that they are the holder of their AS in the RPKI to sign a Letter
    of Authorization (LOA) for some other party to rack and stack
    hardware owned by BB&amp;S.  Unfortunately, while this may be
    technically possible, it is neither appropriate nor meaningful.</t>
      <t>The 'I' in RPKI actually stands for "Infrastructure," as in
    Resource Public Key Infrastructure, not for "Identity".  In fact,
    the RPKI does not provide any association between INRs and the real-world holder(s) of those INRs.  The RPKI provides authorization to
    make assertions only regarding Internet Number Resources, such as IP
    prefixes or AS numbers, and data such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile">Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) records</xref>.</t>
      <t>In short, avoid the desire to use RPKI certificates for any
    purpose other than the verification of authorizations associated
    with the delegation of INRs or attestations related to INRs.
    Instead, recognize that these authorizations and attestations take
    place irrespective of the identity of an RPKI private key holder.</t>

      <name>The RPKI is for Authorization</name>
      <t>The RPKI was designed and specified to sign certificates for use
    within the RPKI itself and to generate Route Origin Authorizations
    (ROAs) <xref target="RFC6480"/> for use in routing.  Its design
    intentionally precluded use for attesting to real-world identity as,
    among other issues, it would expose the Certification Authority (CA)
    to liability.</t>
      <t>That the RPKI does not authenticate real-world identity is by
    design.  If it tried to do so, aside from the liability, it would
    end in a world of complexity with no proof of termination.</t>
      <t>Registries such as the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)
    provide INR to real-world identity mapping through WHOIS <xref target="RFC3912"/> and similar services.  They claim to be
    authoritative, at least for the INRs that they allocate.</t>
      <t>That is, RPKI-based credentials of INRs <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used to
    authenticate real-world documents or transactions.  That might be
    done with some formal external authentication of authority allowing
    an otherwise anonymous INR holder to authenticate the particular
    document or transaction.  Given such external, i.e. non-RPKI,
    verification of authority, the use of RPKI-based credentials adds no
    authenticity.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="discuss">
      <name>Discussion</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC6480" section="2.1" sectionFormat="of">the RPKI base document</xref> says explicitly "An important property of this PKI is that
    certificates do not attest to the identity of the subject."</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC7382" section="3.1" sectionFormat="of">"Template for a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for the Resource PKI (RPKI)"</xref> states that 
 the Subject name in each certificate SHOULD NOT be meaningful
 and goes on to explain this at some length.</t>
      <t>Normally, the INR holder does not hold the private key attesting
    to their resources; the CA does.  The INR
    holder has a real-world business relationship with the CA for which
    they have likely signed real-world documents.</t>
      <t>As the INR holder does not have the keying material, they rely on
    the CA, to which they presumably present credentials, to manipulate
    their INRs.  These credentials may be user ID and password (with two-factor 
    authentication one hopes), a hardware token, client browser
    certificates, etc.</t>
      <t>Hence schemes such as Resource Tagged Attestations <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta"/>
    and Signed Checklists <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc"/> must go to great
    lengths to extract the supposedly relevant keys from the CA.</t>
      <t>For some particular INR, say, Bill's Bait and Sushi's Autonomous
    System (AS) number, someone out on the net probably has the
    credentials to the CA account in which BB&amp;S's INRs are
    registered. That could be the owner of BB&amp;S, Randy's Taco
    Stand, an IT vendor, or the Government of Elbonia.  One simply can
    not know.</t>
      <t>In large organizations, INR management is often compartmentalized
    with no authority over anything beyond dealing with INR
    registration.  The INR manager for Bill's Bait and Sushi is unlikely
    to be authorized to conduct bank transactions for BB&amp;S, or even
    to authorize access to BB&amp;S's servers in some colocation
    facility.</t>
      <t>Then there is the temporal issue.  The holder of that AS may be
    BB&amp;S today when some document was signed, and could be the
    Government of Elbonia tomorrow.  Or the resource could have been
    administratively moved from one CA to another, likely requiring a
    change of keys.  If so, how does one determine if the signature on
    the real-world document is still valid?</t>
      <t>While Ghostbuster Records <xref target="RFC6493"/> may seem to
    identify real-world entities, their semantic content is completely
    arbitrary and does not attest to holding of any INRs.  They are
    merely clues for operational support contact in case of technical
    RPKI problems.</t>
      <t>Usually, before registering INRs, CAs require proof of an INR
    holding via external documentation and authorities.  It is somewhat
    droll that the CPS Template <xref target="RFC7382"/> does not
    mention any diligence the CA must, or even might, conduct to assure
    the INRs are in fact owned by a registrant.</t>
      <t>That someone can provide 'proof of possession' of the private key
    signing over a particular INR should not be taken to imply that they
    are a valid legal representative of the organization in possession
    of that INR. They could be in an INR administrative role, and not be a formal
   representative of the organization.</t>
      <t>Autonomous System Numbers do not identify real-world entities.
    They are identifiers some network operators 'own' and are only used
    for loop detection in routing.  They have no inherent semantics other
    than uniqueness.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Attempts to use RPKI data to authenticate real-world documents or
    other artifacts requiring identity, while possibly cryptographically
    valid within the RPKI, are misleading as to any authenticity.</t>
      <t>When a document is signed with the private key associated with an
      RPKI certificate, the signer is speaking for the INRs (the IP address
      space and AS numbers) in the certificate.  This is not an identity; this
      is an authorization.  In schemes such as Resource Tagged Attestations
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta"/> and Signed Checklists <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc"/>, the signed message further narrows
      this scope of INRs.  The INRs in the message are a subset of the INRs in
      the certificate.  If the signature is valid, the message content comes
      from a party that is authorized to speak for that subset of INRs.</t>
      <t>Control of INRs for an entity could be used to falsely authorize
    transactions or documents for which the INR manager has no
    authority.</t>
