      <t>The ability for IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) or IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive
        Networking <xref target="IEEE8021TSN" format="default"/> to provide the DetNet services of bounded latency and zero congestion
        loss depends upon </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="A">
        <li>configuring and allocating network resources for the exclusive use of DetNet flows; </li>
        <li>identifying, in the data plane, the resources to be utilized by any given packet; and</li>
        <li>the detailed behavior of those resources, especially transmission queue selection, so that latency bounds can be reliably assured.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>
        As explained in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>, DetNet
        flows are notably characterized by 
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	<li>a maximum bandwidth, guaranteed either by the transmitter or by strict input metering, and </li>
        <li>a requirement for a guaranteed worst-case end-to-end latency.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>  That latency guarantee,
        in turn, provides the opportunity for the network to supply enough buffer
        space to guarantee zero congestion loss.
        In this document, it is assumed  that the paths of DetNet flows are fixed. Before the transmission of a DetNet flow, it is possible to calculate 
        end-to-end latency bounds and the amount of buffer space required at each hop to ensure zero congestion loss; this can be used by the applications identified in <xref target="RFC8578" format="default"/>.
      </t>
    <t>
        This document presents a timing model for sources, destinations, and the
        DetNet transit nodes; using this model, it provides a methodology to compute end-to-end latency and backlog bounds for various queuing mechanisms that can be used by the management and control planes to provide DetNet qualities of service. The methodology used in this document accounts for the possibility of packet reordering within a DetNet node. The bounds on the amount of packet reordering is out of the scope of this document and can be found in <xref target="PacketReorderingBounds" format="default"/>. Moreover, this document references specific queuing mechanisms, mentioned in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>, as proofs of concept that can be used to control packet transmission at each output port and achieve the DetNet quality of service (QoS). 
      </t>
      <t>
        Using the model presented in this document, it is possible for an
        implementer, user, or standards development organization to select
        a set of queuing mechanisms for each device in a DetNet network
        and to select a resource reservation algorithm for that network so that
        those elements can work together to provide the DetNet service. <xref target="example" format="default"/> provides an example application of the timing model introduced in this document on a DetNet IP network with a combination of different queuing mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document does not specify any resource reservation protocol or control plane function.
        It does not describe all of the requirements for that protocol or control plane function.
        It does describe requirements for such resource reservation methods
        and for queuing mechanisms that, if met, will enable them to work together.

        <t>
            This document assumes that the following paradigm is used to admit DetNet flows:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	  <li>
                    Perform any configuration required by the DetNet transit nodes in the network for aggregates of DetNet flows.
                    This configuration is done beforehand and not tied to any particular DetNet flow.
                </li>
          <li>
                    Characterize the new DetNet flow, particularly in terms of required bandwidth.
                </li>
          <li>
                    Establish the path that the DetNet flow will take through the network
                    from the source to the destination(s).  This can be a point-to-point
                    or a point-to-multipoint path.
                </li>
          <li>
                    Compute the worst-case end-to-end latency for the DetNet flow using one
                    of the methods below (Sections <xref target="static-calculation" format="counter"/> and
                    <xref target="dynamic-calculation" format="counter"/>).  In the process,
                    determine whether sufficient resources are available for the DetNet flow to
                    guarantee the required latency and to provide zero congestion loss.
                </li>
          <li>
                    Assuming that the resources are available, commit those resources to the
                    DetNet flow.  This may require adjusting the parameters that control
                    the filtering and/or queuing mechanisms at each hop along the DetNet flow's path.
                </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
            This paradigm can be implemented using peer-to-peer protocols or using a
            central controller.  In some situations, a lack of resources can require
            backtracking and recursing through the above list.
        </t>
        <t>
            Issues, such as service preemption of a DetNet flow in favor of another, when
            resources are scarce, are not considered here. Also not addressed is the question of
            how to choose the path to be taken by a DetNet flow.

          <name>Static Latency Calculation</name>
          <dl newline="true" spacing="normal" indent="8">
            <dt>The static problem:</dt>
            <dd>
                        Given a network and a set of DetNet flows, compute an
                        end-to-end latency bound (if computable) for each DetNet flow and compute
                        the resources, particularly buffer space, required in each DetNet transit node
                        to achieve zero congestion loss.
                    </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
                In this calculation, all of the DetNet flows are known before the
                calculation commences.  This problem is of interest to relatively
                static networks or static parts of larger networks. It provides 
                bounds on latency and buffer size.  The calculations can be extended
                to provide global optimizations, such as altering the path of one
                DetNet flow in order to make resources available to another DetNet
                flow with tighter constraints.
          </t>
            <t>
                This calculation may be more difficult to perform than the
                dynamic calculation (<xref target="dynamic-calculation" format="default"/>) because the
                DetNet flows passing through one port on a DetNet transit node affect each other's
                latency.  The effects can even be circular, from node A to B to C
                and back to A.  On the other hand, the static calculation can often
                accommodate queuing methods, such as transmission selection by
                strict priority, that are unsuitable for the dynamic calculation.
          </t>

            <dt>The dynamic problem:</dt>
            <dd>
                        Given a network whose maximum capacity for DetNet flows is
                        bounded by a set of static configuration parameters applied to the
                        DetNet transit nodes and given just one DetNet flow, compute the worst-case
                        end-to-end latency that can be experienced by that flow, no
                        matter what other DetNet flows (within the network's configured parameters)
                        might be created or deleted in the future.  Also, compute the resources,
                        particularly buffer space, required in each DetNet transit node
                        to achieve zero congestion loss.
                    </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
                This calculation is dynamic, in the sense that DetNet flows can be added or deleted
                at any time, with a minimum of computation effort and without affecting
                the guarantees already given to other DetNet flows.
          </t>
          <t>
                Dynamic latency calculation can be done based on the static one described in <xref target="static-calculation" format="default"/>;
                when a new DetNet flow is created or deleted, the entire calculation for all DetNet flows is
                repeated.  If an already-established DetNet flow would be pushed beyond its latency
                requirements by the new DetNet flow request, then the new DetNet flow request can be refused
                or some other suitable action can be taken.
          </t>
          <t>
                The choice of queuing methods is critical to the applicability of the
                dynamic calculation.  Some queuing methods (e.g., CQF, <xref target="cqf" format="default"/>) make
                it easy to configure bounds on the network's capacity and to make
                independent calculations for each DetNet flow. Some other queuing methods (e.g., strict priority with the credit-based shaper
                defined in Section 8.6.8.2 of <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/>) can be used for dynamic DetNet flow creation
                but yield poorer latency and buffer space guarantees than when that same
                queuing method is used for static DetNet flow creation
                (<xref target="static-calculation" format="default"/>).

        <t>In <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>, we see two DetNet transit nodes that are connected via a link. In this model, the only queues that we deal
                with explicitly are attached to the output port; other queues are modeled as variations
                in the other delay times (e.g., an input queue could be modeled as either a variation
                in the link delay (2) or the processing delay (4)).  There are six delays that a packet
                can experience from hop to hop.</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li><t>Output delay</t>
          <t>
            This is the time taken from the selection of a packet for output from
	    a queue to the
                    transmission of the first bit of the packet on the physical link.  If the
                    queue is directly attached to the physical port, output delay can be a constant.
		    However, in many implementations, a multiplexed connection separates the queuing mechanism from a multi-port Network Interface Card (NIC).
                    This causes variations in the output delay that are hard for the forwarding node
                    to predict or control.
                </t></li>
		<li><t>Link delay</t>
          <t>
            This is the time taken from the transmission of the first bit of the
	    packet to the
                    reception of the last bit, assuming that the transmission is not suspended by
                    a frame preemption event.  This delay has two components: the first-bit-out to first-bit-in delay and the first-bit-in to last-bit-in delay that varies with packet  size.  The former is typically constant.  However,
                    a virtual "link" could exhibit a variable link delay.</t></li>
          <li><t>Frame preemption delay</t>
          <t>
            If the packet is interrupted in order to transmit another packet or packets
	    (e.g., frame preemption, as in <xref target="IEEE8023" format="default"/>, clause 99),
                    an arbitrary delay can result.</t></li>
          <li><t>Processing delay</t>
          <t>
                    This delay covers the time from the reception of the last bit of the packet to the
                    time the packet is enqueued in the regulator (queuing subsystem if there is no regulator), as shown in <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>.
                    This delay can be variable and depends on the details of the operation of the forwarding node.</t></li>
          <li><t>Regulator queuing delay</t>
          <t>
                    A regulator, also known as shaper in <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/>, delays some or all of the packets in a traffic stream in order to bring the stream into compliance with an arrival curve; an arrival curve 'alpha(t)' is an upper bound on the number of bits observed within any interval t. The regulator delay is the time spent from the insertion of the last bit of a packet into a regulation queue until the time the packet is declared eligible according to its regulation constraints. We assume that this time can be calculated based on the details of regulation policy. If there is no regulation, this time is zero.</t></li>

                    This is the time spent for a packet from being declared eligible until being
                    selected for output on the next link.  We assume that this time is
                    calculable based on the details of the queuing mechanism. If there is no regulation, this time is from the insertion 
                    of the packet into a queue until it is selected for output on the next link.

        <t>Not shown in <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/> are the other output queues that we
                presume are also attached to that same output port as the queue shown, and against
                which this shown queue competes for transmission opportunities.</t>
        <t>In this analysis, the measurement is from the point at which a packet is selected for output in a node to the point at which it is selected for output in the next downstream node (i.e., the definition of a "hop").  In general,
                any queue selection method that is suitable for use in a DetNet network includes
                a detailed specification as to exactly when packets are selected for transmission.
                Any variations in any of the delay times 1-4 result in a need for additional
                buffers in the queue.  If all delays 1-4 are constant, then any variation in the
                time at which packets are inserted into a queue depends entirely on the timing
                of packet selection in the previous node.  If delays 1-4 are not constant,
                then additional buffers are required in the queue to absorb these variations.
                Thus:

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Variations in the output delay (1) require buffers to absorb that variation

        <t>End-to-end latency bounds can be computed using the delay model in <xref target="relay_model" format="default"/>. Here, it is important
        to be aware that, for several queuing mechanisms, the end-to-end latency bound is less than the sum of the
        per-hop latency bounds.
        An end-to-end latency bound for one DetNet flow
        can be computed as
        </t>
        <t indent="3"> end_to_end_delay_bound = non_queuing_delay_bound + queuing_delay_bound
            </t>

        <t>The two terms in the above formula are computed as follows. </t>
        <t>
        First, at the h-th hop along the path of this DetNet flow, obtain an upper-bound
        per-hop_non_queuing_delay_bound[h] on the sum of the bounds over delays
        1, 2, 3, and 4
        of  <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>. These upper bounds are expected to
        depend on the specific technology of the DetNet transit node at the h-th hop but not on
        the T-SPEC of this DetNet flow <xref target="RFC9016" format="default"/>. Then, set non_queuing_delay_bound = the sum
        of per-hop_non_queuing_delay_bound[h] over all hops h. 
        </t>
        <t>
        Second, compute queuing_delay_bound as an upper bound to the sum of the
        queuing delays along the path. The value of queuing_delay_bound depends
        on the information on the arrival curve of this DetNet flow and possibly
        of other flows in the network, as well as the specifics of the queuing
        mechanisms deployed along the path of this DetNet flow. Note that arrival curve of the DetNet flow at the source is immediately specified by the T-SPEC of this flow. The computation of queuing_delay_bound 
        is described in <xref target="queuing" format="default"/> as a separate section.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="queuing" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Queuing Delay Bound</name>
        <t>
        For several queuing mechanisms, queuing_delay_bound is less than the sum of upper bounds on the queuing delays (5 and 6)
        at every hop.  This occurs with (1) per-flow queuing and (2) aggregate queuing with regulators, as explained in Sections <xref target="perflow" format="counter"/>, <xref target="perclass" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="queue_model" format="counter"/>. For other queuing mechanisms, the only available value of queuing_delay_bound
        is the sum of the per-hop queuing delay bounds.
        </t>
        <t>
        The computation of per-hop queuing delay bounds must account for the fact that the arrival curve of a DetNet flow is no longer satisfied at the ingress of a hop, since burstiness increases as one flow traverses one DetNet transit node. If a regulator is placed at a hop, an arrival curve of a DetNet flow at the entrance of the queuing subsystem of this hop is the one configured at the regulator (also called shaping curve in <xref target="NetCalBook" format="default"/>); otherwise, an arrival curve of the flow can be derived using the delay jitter of the flow from the last regulation point (the last regulator in the path of the flow if there is any, otherwise the source of the flow) to the ingress of the hop; more formally, assume a DetNet flow has an arrival curve at the last regulation point equal to 'alpha(t)' and the delay jitter from the last regulation point to the ingress of the hop is 'V'. Then, the arrival curve at the ingress of the hop is 'alpha(t+V)'. 
        </t>
        <t>
        For example, consider a DetNet flow with T-SPEC "Interval: tau, MaxPacketsPerInterval: K, MaxPayloadSize: L" at the source. Then, a leaky-bucket arrival curve for such flow at the source is alpha(t)=r * t+ b, t&gt;0; alpha(0)=0, where r is the rate and b is the bucket size, computed as
        </t>
        <t indent="3">r =  K * (L+L') / tau,
           </t>
           <t indent="3">b = K * (L+L').
           </t>
        <t> 
        where L' is the size of any added networking technology-specific encapsulation (e.g., MPLS label(s), UDP, or IP headers). Now, if the flow has a delay jitter of 'V' from the last regulation point to the ingress of a hop, an arrival curve at this point is r * t + b + r * V, implying that the burstiness is increased by r*V. More detailed information on arrival curves is available in <xref target="NetCalBook" format="default"/>.

          <name>Per-Flow Queuing Mechanisms</name>
<t>
            With such mechanisms, each flow uses a separate queue inside every node. The service for each queue is abstracted with a guaranteed rate and a latency. For every DetNet flow, a per-node latency bound, as well as an end-to-end latency bound, can be computed from the traffic specification of this DetNet flow at its source and from the values of rates and latencies at all nodes along its path. An instance of per-flow queuing is Guaranteed Service <xref target="RFC2212" format="default"/>, for which the details of latency bound calculation are presented in <xref target="intserv" format="default"/>.

        <section anchor="perclass" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Aggregate Queuing Mechanisms</name>
          <t>
                With such mechanisms, multiple flows are aggregated into macro-flows and there is one FIFO queue per macro-flow. A practical example is the credit-based shaper defined in Section 8.6.8.2 of <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/>, where a macro-flow is called a "class".  One key issue in this context is how to deal with the burstiness cascade; individual flows that share a resource dedicated to a macro-flow may see their burstiness increase, which may in turn cause increased burstiness to other flows downstream of this resource. Computing delay upper bounds for such cases is difficult and, in some conditions, impossible <xref target="CharnyDelay" format="default"/> <xref target="BennettDelay" format="default"/>. Also, when bounds are obtained, they depend on the complete configuration and must be recomputed when one flow is added (i.e., the dynamic calculation in <xref target="dynamic-calculation" format="default"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
                A solution to deal with this issue for the DetNet flows is to reshape them at every hop. This can be done with per-flow regulators (e.g., leaky-bucket shapers), but this requires per-flow queuing and defeats the purpose of aggregate queuing. An alternative is the interleaved regulator, which reshapes individual DetNet flows without per-flow queuing <xref target="SpechtUBS" format="default"/> <xref target="IEEE8021Qcr" format="default"/>. With  an interleaved regulator, the packet at the head of the queue is regulated based on
its (flow) regulation constraints; it is released at the earliest time at which this is possible without violating the constraint. One key feature of a per-flow or interleaved regulator is that it does not increase worst-case latency bounds <xref target="LeBoudecTheory" format="default"/>. Specifically, when an interleaved regulator is appended to a FIFO subsystem, it does not increase the worst-case delay of the latter. In <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>, when the order of packets from the output of a queuing subsystem at node A to the entrance of a regulator at node B is preserved, then the regulator does not increase the worst-case latency bounds. This is made possible if all the systems are FIFO or a DetNet Packet Ordering Function (POF) is implemented just before the regulator. This property does not hold if packet reordering occurs from the output of a queuing subsystem to the entrance of the next downstream interleaved regulator, e.g., at a non-FIFO switching fabric.

          <t>
                <xref target="fig_detnet_e2e_example" format="default"/> shows an example of a network with 5 nodes, an aggregate queuing mechanism, and interleaved regulators, as in <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>. 
                An end-to-end delay bound for DetNet flow f, traversing nodes 1 to 5, is calculated as follows:

	  <t indent="3"> end_to_end_latency_bound_of_flow_f = C12 + C23 + C34 + S4
                    </t>
          <t>
                In the above formula, Cij is a bound on the delay of the queuing subsystem in node i and interleaved regulator of node j, 
                and S4 is a bound on the delay of the queuing subsystem in node 4 for DetNet flow f. In fact, using the delay definitions in 
                <xref target="relay_model" format="default"/>, Cij is a bound on a sum of delays 1, 2, 3, and 6 of node i and delays 4 and 5 of node j. Similarly, S4 is a bound on 
                sum of delays 1, 2, 3, and 6 of node 4. A practical example of the queuing model and delay calculation is presented <xref target="TSNwithATSmodel" format="default"/>.

            A sender can be a DetNet node that uses exactly the same queuing methods as its adjacent DetNet transit node so that the latency and buffer bounds calculations at the first hop are indistinguishable from those at a later hop within the DetNet domain. On the other hand, the sender may be DetNet unaware; in which case, some conditioning of the DetNet flow may be necessary at the ingress DetNet transit node. The ingress conditioning typically consists of the regulators described in <xref target="relay_model" format="default"/>.

        <name>Interspersed DetNet-Unaware Transit Nodes</name>
        <t>
            It is sometimes desirable to build a network that has both DetNet-aware
            transit nodes and DetNet-unaware transit nodes and for a DetNet flow to
            traverse an island of DetNet-unaware transit nodes while still allowing the
            network to offer delay and congestion loss guarantees.  This is possible
            under certain conditions.
        </t>
        <t>
            In general, when passing through a DetNet-unaware island, the island may cause
            delay variation in excess of what would be caused by DetNet nodes.  That
            is, the DetNet flow might be "lumpier" after traversing the DetNet-unaware island.
            DetNet guarantees for delay and buffer requirements can still be
            calculated and met if and only if the following are true:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	  <li>
                    The latency variation across the DetNet-unaware island must be
                    bounded and calculable.
                </li>
          <li>
                    An ingress conditioning function (<xref target="ingress" format="default"/>)
                    is required at the reentry to the DetNet-aware domain.
                    This will, at least, require some extra buffering to accommodate
                    the additional delay variation and thus further increases the
                    latency bound.
                </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
            The ingress conditioning is exactly the same problem as that of a sender
            at the edge of the DetNet domain.  The requirement for bounds on the
            latency variation across the DetNet-unaware island is typically the most
            difficult to achieve.  Without such a bound, it is obvious that DetNet
            cannot deliver its guarantees, so a DetNet-unaware island that cannot
            offer bounded latency variation cannot be used to carry a DetNet flow.

        When the input rate to an output queue exceeds the output rate for a sufficient
        length of time, the queue must overflow.  This is congestion loss, and this is
        what DetNet seeks to avoid.
      </t>
      <t>
        To avoid congestion losses, an upper bound on the backlog present in the regulator and queuing subsystem of <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>
    must be computed during resource reservation. This bound depends on the set of flows that use these queues, 
    the details of the specific queuing mechanism, and an 
    upper bound on the processing delay (4). The queue must contain the packet in transmission, plus all other packets that
    are waiting to be selected for output. A conservative backlog  bound that applies to all systems can be derived as follows.  
      </t>
      <t>
    The backlog bound is counted in data units (bytes or words of multiple bytes) that are relevant for buffer allocation.

        Ideally, neither of these actions are performed on DetNet packets.  Full queues

        <t>
    In <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/> and <xref target="IEEE8023" format="default"/>, the transmission of a frame
    can be interrupted by one or more "express" frames; then, the interrupted frame can
    continue transmission.  The frame preemption is modeled as
    consisting of two MAC/PHY stacks: one for packets that
    can be interrupted and one for packets that can interrupt the interruptible packets.
    Only one layer of frame preemption is supported -- a transmitter cannot have more than one
    interrupted frame in progress.  DetNet flows typically pass through the interrupting
    MAC. For those DetNet flows with T-SPEC, latency bounds can be 
    calculated by the methods provided in the following sections that account for the effect of frame preemption, according to the specific 
    queuing mechanism that is used in DetNet nodes. Best-effort queues pass through the 
    interruptible MAC and can thus be preempted.

        <name>Time-Aware Shaper</name>
        <t>
            In <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/>, the notion of time-scheduling queue gates is
            described in Section 8.6.8.4. On each node, the transmission selection for packets 
            is controlled by time-synchronized gates; each output queue is associated with a gate.
            The gates can be either open or closed. The states of the gates are
            determined by the gate control list (GCL). The GCL specifies the opening and closing
            times of the gates. The design of the GCL must satisfy the requirement of 
            latency upper bounds of all DetNet flows; therefore, those DetNet flows that traverse a 
            network that uses this kind of shaper must have bounded latency if the traffic and nodes are conformant.
        </t>
        <t>
            Note that scheduled traffic service relies on a synchronized
            network and coordinated GCL configuration. Synthesis of the GCL on multiple
            nodes in a network is a scheduling problem considering all DetNet flows
            traversing the network, which is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard
            (NP-hard) problem <xref target="Sch8021Qbv" format="default"/>. Also, at the time of writing, scheduled traffic service
            supports no more than eight traffic queues, typically using up to seven
            priority queues and at least one best effort.

            In this queuing model, it is assumed that the DetNet nodes are FIFO. We consider the four traffic classes (Definition 3.268 of <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/>): control-data traffic (CDT),
            class A, class B, and best effort (BE) in decreasing order of priority. Flows of classes A and B are DetNet flows that are less critical than CDT (such as studio audio and video traffic, as in IEEE 802.1BA Audio-Video-Bridging). This model is a subset of Time-Sensitive Networking, as described next.
        </t>
        <t>
            Based on the timing model described in <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>, contention occurs only at the output port of a DetNet transit node; therefore, the focus of the rest of this subsection is on the regulator and queuing subsystem in the output port of a DetNet transit node. The input flows are identified using the information in (<xref target="RFC8939" section="5.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>). Then, they are aggregated into eight macro-flows based
            on their service requirements; we refer to each macro-flow as a class.
             The output port performs aggregate scheduling with eight queues (queuing subsystems): one for CDT, one for class A flows, one for class B flows, and five for BE traffic denoted as BE0-BE4. The queuing policy for each queuing subsystem is FIFO. In addition, each node output port also performs per-flow regulation for 
            class A and B flows using an interleaved regulator (IR). This regulation is called 
   asynchronous traffic shaping <xref target="IEEE8021Qcr" format="default"/>. Thus, at each output port of a node, there is one interleaved regulator per input 
            port and per class; the interleaved regulator is mapped to the regulator depicted in <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>. The detailed picture of scheduling and regulation architecture at a node output port is given by <xref target="fig_TSN_node" format="default"/>. The packets received at a node input port for a given class are enqueued in the respective interleaved regulator at the output port.
            Then, the packets from all the flows, including CDT and BE flows, are enqueued in a queuing subsystem; there is no regulator for CDT and BE flows.

            Each of the queuing subsystems for classes A and B contains a credit-based shaper (CBS). The CBS serves a packet from a class according to the available credit
            for that class. As described in Section 8.6.8.2 and Annex L.1 of <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/>, the credit for each class A or B increases based on the idle slope (as guaranteed rate) and decreases based on the sendslope (typically equal to the difference between the guaranteed and the output link rates), both of which 
            are parameters of the CBS. The CDT and BE0-BE4 flows are served by separate queuing subsystems. Then, packets from all flows are
            served by a transmission selection subsystem that serves packets from each class based on its priority. All subsystems are non-preemptive.
            Guarantees for class A and B traffic can be provided only if CDT is bounded. It is assumed that the CDT has a leaky-bucket arrival curve with two parameters: r_h as rate and b_h as bucket size. That is, the amount of bits entering a node within a time interval t is bounded by r_h * t + b_h. 
        </t>
        <t>
            Additionally, it is assumed that the class A and B flows are also regulated at their source according to a leaky-bucket arrival curve. At the source, the traffic satisfies its regulation constraint, i.e., the delay due to interleaved regulator at the source is ignored.
        </t>
        <t>
            At each DetNet transit node implementing an interleaved regulator, packets of multiple flows are processed in one FIFO queue. The packet at the head
            of the queue is regulated based on its leaky-bucket parameters. It is released at the earliest time at which this is possible without violating 
            the constraint. 
        </t>
        <t>
                The regulation parameters for a flow (leaky-bucket rate and bucket size) are the same at its source and at all DetNet transit nodes along its path in the case where all clocks are perfect. However, in reality, there is clock non-ideality throughout the DetNet domain, even with clock synchronization. This phenomenon causes inaccuracy in the rates configured at the regulators that may lead to network instability. To avoid instability, the rates are set as the source rates with some positive margin when configuring regulators. <xref target="ThomasTime" format="default"/> describes and provides solutions to this issue.

Besides, it is necessary to have the information on each class, i.e., maximum packet length of classes A, B, and BE. Moreover, the leaky-bucket parameters of CDT (r_h, b_h) must be known.

        <t>
         Annex T of <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/> describes Cyclic Queuing
         and Forwarding (CQF), which provides bounded latency and zero congestion loss using
         the time-scheduled gates of Section 8.6.8.4 of <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/>.  For a given class of DetNet
         flows, a set of two or more buffers is provided at the output queue layer of
         <xref target="fig_8021Q_data_model" format="default"/>.  A cycle time T_c is configured for each class of DetNet
         flows c, and all of the buffer sets in a class of DetNet
         flows swap buffers simultaneously throughout the DetNet domain
         at that cycle rate, all in phase. In such a mechanism, the regulator, as mentioned in <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>, is not required.
        </t>
        <t>
        In the case of two-buffer CQF, each class of DetNet flows c has two buffers, namely buffer1 and buffer2. In a cycle (i) when buffer1 accumulates received packets from the node's reception ports, buffer2 transmits the already stored packets from the previous cycle (i-1). In the next cycle (i+1), buffer2 stores the received packets and buffer1 transmits the packets received in cycle (i). The duration of each cycle is T_c.
        </t>
        <t>
        The cycle time T_c must be carefully chosen; it needs to be large enough to accommodate all the DetNet traffic, plus at least one maximum packet (or fragment) size from lower priority queues, which might be received within a cycle. 
        Also, the value of T_c includes a time interval, called dead time (DT), which is the sum of delays 1, 2, 3, and 4 defined in <xref target="fig_timing_model" format="default"/>. The value of DT guarantees that the last packet of one cycle in a node is fully delivered to a buffer of the next node in the same cycle. A two-buffer CQF is recommended if DT is small compared to T_c. For a large DT, CQF with more buffers can be used, and a cycle identification label can be added to the packets.
        </t>
        <t>
        The per-hop latency is determined by the cycle time T_c: a packet transmitted from a node at a cycle (i) is transmitted from the next node at cycle (i+1). Then, if the packet traverses h hops, the maximum latency experienced by the packet is from 
         the beginning of cycle (i) to the end of cycle (i+h); also, the minimum latency is from the end of cycle (i), before the DT, to the beginning of cycle (i+h). Then, the maximum latency is:
        </t>
          <t indent="3">(h+1) T_c</t>
        <t> and the minimum latency is:</t>
          <t indent="3">(h-1) T_c + DT.</t>
     <t>
         Ingress conditioning (<xref target="ingress" format="default"/>) may be required if the source of a DetNet flow does not itself employ CQF. Since there are no per-flow parameters in the CQF technique, per-hop configuration is not required in the CQF forwarding nodes.

Consider <xref target="fig_ip_detnet_simple" format="default"/>, taken from <xref target="RFC8939" section="3" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>, which shows a simple IP network:

          End system 1 implements Guaranteed Service <xref target="RFC2212" format="default"/>, as in <xref target="intserv" format="default"/>, between itself and relay node 1. 
        </li>
        <li>
                Sub-network 1 is a TSN network. The nodes in sub-network 1 implement credit-based shapers with asynchronous traffic shaping, as in <xref target="TSNwithATSmodel" format="default"/>.
            </li>
        <li>
                Sub-network 2 is a TSN network. The nodes in sub-network 2 implement Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding with two buffers, as in <xref target="cqf" format="default"/>.
            </li>
        <li>
                The relay nodes 1 and 2 implement credit-based shapers with asynchronous traffic shaping, as in <xref target="TSNwithATSmodel" format="default"/>. They also perform the aggregation and mapping of IP DetNet flows to TSN streams (<xref target="RFC9023" section="4.4" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>).

      <t>Consider a fully centralized control plane for the network of <xref target="fig_ip_detnet_simple" format="default"/>, as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-controller-plane-framework" section="3.2" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>. Suppose end system 1 wants to create a DetNet flow with a traffic specification destined to end system 2 with end-to-end delay bound requirement D. Therefore, the control plane receives a flow establishment request and calculates a number of valid paths through the network (<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-controller-plane-framework" section="3.2" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>). To select a proper path, the control plane needs to compute an end-to-end delay bound at every node of each selected path p. 
</t>
      <t>
    The end-to-end delay bound is d1 + d2_p + d3_p, where d1 is the delay bound from end system 1 to the entrance of relay node 1, d2_p is the delay bound for path p from relay node 1 to the entrance of the first node in sub-network 2, and d3_p is the delay bound of path p from the first node in sub-network 2 to end system 2. The computation of d1 is explained in <xref target="intserv" format="default"/>. Since the relay node 1, sub-network 1, and relay node 2 implement aggregate queuing, we use the results in Sections <xref target="perclass" format="counter"/> and <xref target="TSNwithATSmodel" format="counter"/> to compute d2_p for the path p. Finally, d3_p is computed using the delay bound computation of <xref target="cqf" format="default"/>. Any path p, such that d1 + d2_p + d3_p &lt;= D, satisfies the delay bound requirement of the flow. If there is no such path, the control plane may compute a new set of valid paths and redo the delay bound computation or reject the DetNet flow.
</t>
      <t>
    As soon as the control plane selects a path that satisfies the delay bound constraint, it allocates and reserves the resources in the path for the DetNet flow (<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-controller-plane-framework" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="4.2"/>).
</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
    Detailed security considerations for DetNet are cataloged in <xref target="RFC9055" format="default"/>, and more general security considerations are described in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Security aspects that are unique to DetNet are those whose aim is to provide the specific QoS aspects of DetNet, specifically bounded end-to-end delivery latency and zero congestion loss. Achieving such loss rates and bounded latency may not be possible in the face of a highly capable adversary, such as the one envisioned by the Internet Threat Model of BCP 72 <xref target="RFC3552" format="default"/>, which can arbitrarily drop or delay any or all traffic. In order to present meaningful security considerations, we consider a somewhat weaker attacker who does not control the physical links of the DetNet domain but may have the ability to control or change the behavior of some resources within the boundary of the DetNet domain.
      </t>
      <t>
        Latency bound calculations use parameters that reflect physical quantities. If an attacker finds a way to change the physical quantities, unknown to the control and management planes, the latency calculations fail and may result in latency violation and/or congestion losses. An example of such attacks is to make some traffic sources under the control of the attacker send more traffic than their assumed T-SPECs. This type of attack is typically avoided by ingress conditioning at the edge of a DetNet domain. However, it must be insured that such ingress conditioning is done per flow and that the buffers are segregated such that if one flow exceeds its T-SPEC, it does not cause buffer overflow for other flows.
      </t>
    <t>
        Some queuing mechanisms require time synchronization and operate correctly only if the time synchronization works correctly. In the case of CQF, the correct alignments of cycles can fail if an attack against time synchronization fools a node into having an incorrect offset. Some of these attacks can be prevented by cryptographic authentication as in Annex K of <xref target="IEEE1588" format="default"/> for the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). However, the attacks that change the physical latency of the links used by the time synchronization protocol are still possible even if the time synchronization protocol is protected by authentication and cryptography <xref target="DelayAttack" format="default"/>. Such attacks can be detected only by their effects on latency bound violations and congestion losses, which do not occur in normal DetNet operation.
