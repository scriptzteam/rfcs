      <abstract>
      <t> This document describes a method to transport Internet Key Exchange
        Protocol (IKE) and IPsec packets over a TCP connection for traversing
        network middleboxes that may block IKE negotiation over UDP.  This
        method, referred to as "TCP encapsulation", involves sending both IKE
        packets for Security Association (SA) establishment and Encapsulating
        Security Payload (ESP) packets over a TCP connection.  This method is
        intended to be used as a fallback option when IKE cannot be
        negotiated over UDP.
      </t>

      
      <t>TCP encapsulation for IKE and IPsec was defined in RFC 8229.
        This document clarifies the specification for TCP encapsulation by including
        additional clarifications obtained during implementation and deployment
        of this method. This documents obsoletes RFC 8229.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t> The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296" format="default"/> is a
        protocol for establishing IPsec Security Associations (SAs) using
        IKE messages over UDP for control traffic and using Encapsulating
        Security Payload (ESP) messages <xref target="RFC4303" format="default"/> for encrypted data traffic.
        Many network middleboxes that filter traffic on public hotspots block
        all UDP traffic, including IKE and IPsec, but allow TCP connections
        through because they appear to be web traffic.  Devices on these
        networks that need to use IPsec (to access private enterprise
        networks, to route Voice over IP calls to carrier networks
        because of security policies, etc.) are unable to establish IPsec SAs.
        This document defines a method for encapsulating IKE control messages
        as well as ESP data messages within a TCP connection. Note that Authentication Header (AH) is not supported by this specification.
      </t>

      
      <t> Using TCP as a transport for IPsec packets adds the third option (below) to the
        list of traditional IPsec transports:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Direct.  Usually, IKE negotiations begin over UDP port 500.  If
          no Network Address Translation (NAT) device is detected between
          the Initiator and the Responder, then subsequent IKE packets are
          sent over UDP port 500 and IPsec data packets are sent
          using ESP.</li>
        <li>UDP Encapsulation.  Described in <xref target="RFC3948" format="default"/>.  If a NAT is detected between the
          Initiator and the Responder, then subsequent IKE packets are sent
          over UDP port 4500 with 4 bytes of zero at the start of the
          UDP payload, and ESP packets are sent out over UDP port 4500.
          Some implementations default to using UDP encapsulation even when no NAT is
          detected on the path, as some middleboxes do not support IP
          protocols other than TCP and UDP.</li>
        <li>TCP Encapsulation.  Described in this document.  If the other two methods are not available or
          appropriate, IKE negotiation packets as well as ESP packets can
          be sent over a single TCP connection to the peer.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <t> Direct use of ESP or UDP encapsulation should be preferred by
        IKE implementations due to performance concerns when using
        TCP encapsulation (<xref target="perf" format="default"/>).  Most implementations should use
        TCP encapsulation only on networks where negotiation over UDP has
        been attempted without receiving responses from the peer or if a
        network is known to not support UDP.</t>

        <name>Prior Work and Motivation</name>
        <t> Encapsulating IKE connections within TCP streams is a common approach
          to solve the problem of UDP packets being blocked by network
          middleboxes.  The specific goals of this document are as follows:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>To promote interoperability by defining a standard method of
            framing IKE and ESP messages within TCP streams.</li>
          <li>To be compatible with the current IKEv2 standard without requiring
            modifications or extensions.</li>
          <li>To use IKE over UDP by default to avoid the overhead of other
            alternatives that always rely on TCP or Transport Layer Security
            (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Some previous alternatives include:</t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal" indent="3">
          <dt>Cellular Network Access:</dt>
          <dd>
            Interworking Wireless LAN (IWLAN) uses IKEv2 to create secure
            connections to cellular carrier networks for making voice calls
            and accessing other network services over Wi-Fi networks. 3GPP has
            recommended that IKEv2 and ESP packets be sent within a TLS
            connection to be able to establish connections on restrictive
            networks.
            </dd>
          <dt>ISAKMP over TCP:</dt>
          <dd>
            Various non-standard extensions to the Internet Security
            Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) have been
            deployed that send IPsec traffic over TCP or TCP-like packets.
            </dd>
          <dt>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPNs:</dt>
          <dd>
            Many proprietary VPN solutions use a combination of TLS and IPsec
            in order to provide reliability.  These often run on TCP port 443.
            </dd>
          <dt>IKEv2 over TCP:</dt>
          <dd>
            IKEv2 over TCP as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ike-tcp" format="default"/> is used to avoid UDP
            fragmentation.

        <t> This document distinguishes between the IKE peer that initiates TCP
          connections to be used for TCP encapsulation and the roles of
          Initiator and Responder for particular IKE messages.  During the
          course of IKE exchanges, the role of IKE Initiator and Responder may
          swap for a given SA (as with IKE SA rekeys), while the Initiator of
          the TCP connection is still responsible for tearing down the TCP
          connection and re-establishing it if necessary.  For this reason,
          this document will use the term "TCP Originator" to indicate the IKE
          peer that initiates TCP connections.  The peer that receives TCP
          connections will be referred to as the "TCP Responder".  If an IKE SA
          is rekeyed one or more times, the TCP Originator <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> remain the peer
          that originally initiated the first IKE SA.

      <name>Configuration</name>
      <t>One of the main reasons to use TCP encapsulation is that UDP traffic
        may be entirely blocked on a network.  Because of this, support for
        TCP encapsulation is not specifically negotiated in the IKE exchange.
        Instead, support for TCP encapsulation must be preconfigured on both
        the TCP Originator and the TCP Responder.</t>
      <t>Compliant implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support TCP encapsulation on TCP port 4500,
        which is reserved for IPsec NAT traversal.</t>
      <t>Beyond a flag indicating support for TCP encapsulation, the
        configuration for each peer can include the following optional
        parameters:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Alternate TCP ports on which the specific TCP Responder listens
          for incoming connections.  Note that the TCP Originator may
          initiate TCP connections to the TCP Responder from any local port.</li>
        <li>An extra framing protocol to use on top of TCP to further
          encapsulate the stream of IKE and IPsec packets.  See <xref target="tls" format="default"/>
          for a detailed discussion.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Since TCP encapsulation of IKE and IPsec packets adds overhead and
        has potential performance trade-offs compared to direct or
        UDP-encapsulated SAs (as described in <xref target="perf" format="default"/>), implementations
        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> prefer ESP direct or UDP-encapsulated SAs over
        TCP-encapsulated SAs when possible.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="format" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>TCP-Encapsulated Data Formats</name>
      <t>Like UDP encapsulation, TCP encapsulation uses the first 4 bytes
        of a message to differentiate IKE and ESP messages.  TCP
        encapsulation also adds a 16-bit Length field that precedes every message
        to define the boundaries of messages within a stream.  
		The value in this field is equal to the length of the original message
		plus the length of the field itself, in octets.  If the first 32 bits
		of the message are zeros (a non-ESP marker), then the contents comprise an
        IKE message.  Otherwise, the contents comprise an ESP message.
        AH messages are not supported for TCP
        encapsulation.
      </t>
      <t>Although a TCP stream may be able to send very long messages,
        implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> limit message lengths to match the lengths
        used for UDP encapsulation of ESP messages. 
	The maximum message length is used as the effective MTU 
        for connections that are being encrypted using ESP, 
        so the maximum message length will influence characteristics of these
        connections, such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS).
      </t>
      <t>Due to the fact that the Length field is 16 bits and includes both the message length and the 
        length of the field itself, it is impossible to encapsulate messages greater than 65533 
        octets in length. In most cases, this is not a problem. Note that a similar
        limitation exists for encapsulation ESP in UDP <xref target="RFC3948" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>The minimum size of an encapsulated message is 1 octet 
        (for NAT-keepalive packets, see <xref target="nat-ka" format="default"/>). Empty messages 
        (where the Length field equals 2) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be silently ignored by receiver. 
      </t>
      <t>Note that this method of encapsulation will also work for placing IKE
        and ESP messages within any protocol that presents a stream
        abstraction, beyond TCP.

      <t>If other framing protocols are used within TCP to further encapsulate
        or encrypt the stream of IKE and ESP messages, the stream prefix must
        be at the start of the TCP Originator's IKE and ESP message stream
        within the added protocol layer (<xref target="tls" format="default"/>).  Although some framing
        protocols do support negotiating inner protocols, the stream prefix
        should always be used in order for implementations to be as generic
        as possible and not rely on other framing protocols on top of TCP.

      <t>TCP encapsulation is applicable only when it has been configured to
        be used with specific IKE peers.  If a Responder is configured to accept and is allowed to use
        TCP encapsulation, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> listen on the configured port(s) in case
        any peers will initiate new IKE sessions.  Initiators <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use TCP
        encapsulation for any IKE session to a peer that is configured to
        support TCP encapsulation, although it is recommended that Initiators
        only use TCP encapsulation when traffic over UDP is blocked.
      </t>
      <t>Since the support of TCP encapsulation is a configured property, not
        a negotiated one, it is recommended that if there are multiple IKE
        endpoints representing a single peer (such as multiple machines with
        different IP addresses when connecting by Fully Qualified Domain
        Name (FQDN), or endpoints used with IKE redirection), all of the endpoints
        equally support TCP encapsulation.
      </t>
      <t>If TCP encapsulation is being used for a specific IKE SA, all
        IKE messages for that IKE SA and ESP packets for its Child SAs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent over a TCP
        connection until the SA is deleted or IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming
        (MOBIKE) is used to change the SA endpoints and/or the encapsulation
        protocol.  See <xref target="mobike" format="default"/> for more details on using MOBIKE to

        <name>Recommended Fallback from UDP</name>
        <t>Since UDP is the preferred method of transport for IKE messages,
          implementations that use TCP encapsulation should have an algorithm
          for deciding when to use TCP after determining that UDP is unusable.
          If an Initiator implementation has no prior knowledge about the
          network it is on and the status of UDP on that network, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
          always attempt to negotiate IKE over UDP first.  IKEv2 defines how to
          use retransmission timers with IKE messages and, specifically,
          IKE_SA_INIT messages <xref target="RFC7296" format="default"/>.  Generally, this means that the
          implementation will define a frequency of retransmission and the
          maximum number of retransmissions allowed before marking the IKE SA
          as failed.  An implementation can attempt negotiation over TCP once
          it has hit the maximum retransmissions over UDP, or slightly before
          to reduce connection setup delays.  It is recommended that the
          initial message over UDP be retransmitted at least once before
          falling back to TCP, unless the Initiator knows beforehand that the
          network is likely to block UDP.
        </t>
        <t>When switching from UDP to TCP, a new IKE_SA_INIT exchange <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be

          messages will be sent over the TCP connection.  The TCP Responder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> wait for the entire
          stream prefix to be received on the stream before trying to parse out
          any IKE or ESP messages.  The stream prefix is sent only once, and
          only by the TCP Originator.

        <t>In order to close an IKE session, either the Initiator or Responder
          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> gracefully tear down IKE SAs with DELETE payloads.  Once the

        <t>An unexpected FIN or a TCP Reset on the TCP connection may indicate a

          it is torn down for any unexpected reason.  Since new TCP connections
          may use different IP addresses and/or ports due to NAT mappings or local address or port allocations
          changing, the TCP Responder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> allow packets for existing SAs to be
          received from new source IP addresses and ports. Note that the

        <t>Multiple IKE SAs <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> share a single TCP connection, unless one

        </t>
        <t>If a TCP connection is being used to continue an existing IKE/ESP
  session, the TCP Responder can recognize the session using either the
  IKE SPI from an encapsulated IKE message or the ESP SPI from an
  encapsulated ESP packet.  If the session had been fully established
  previously, it is suggested that the TCP Originator send an
  UPDATE_SA_ADDRESSES message if MOBIKE is supported and an
  empty informational message if it is not.

        <t>The TCP Responder <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> accept any messages for the existing IKE
          session on a new incoming connection, unless that connection begins

          subsequent messages that cannot be parsed as valid IKE messages or
          ESP messages with known SPIs, or if the authentication check for an
          IKE message or ESP message with a known SPI fails.  Implementations <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>
          tear down a connection if only a few consecutive ESP packets have unknown
          SPIs since the SPI databases may be momentarily out of sync.  If
          there is instead a syntax issue within an IKE message, an
          implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send the INVALID_SYNTAX notify payload and
          tear down the IKE SA as usual, rather than tearing down the TCP
          connection directly.
        </t>
        <t>A TCP Originator <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only open one TCP connection per IKE SA, over
          which it sends all of the corresponding IKE and ESP messages.  This
          helps ensure that any firewall or NAT mappings allocated for the TCP
          connection apply to all of the traffic associated with the IKE SA
          equally.
        </t>
        <t>  As with TCP Originators, a TCP Responder <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send packets for an
  IKE SA and its Child SAs over only one TCP connection at any given
  time.  It <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> choose the TCP connection on which it last received
  a valid and decryptable IKE or ESP message.  In order to be
  considered valid for choosing a TCP connection, an IKE message must
  be successfully decrypted and authenticated, not be a retransmission
  of a previously received message, and be within the expected window
  for IKE message IDs.  Similarly, an ESP message must be successfully
  decrypted and authenticated, and must not be a replay of a previous
  message.
        </t>
        <t>Since a connection may be broken and a new connection re-established
          by the TCP Originator without the TCP Responder being aware, a TCP
          Responder <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> accept receiving IKE and ESP messages on both old
          and new connections until the old connection is closed by the TCP
          Originator.  A TCP Responder <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> close a TCP connection that it
          perceives as idle and extraneous (one previously used for IKE and ESP
          messages that has been replaced by a new connection).

        <t><xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1"/> describes how IKEv2 deals with the unreliability
        of the UDP protocol.



In brief, the exchange Initiator is responsible for retransmissions
and must retransmit request messages until a response message is
received.  If no reply is received after several
          retransmissions, the SA is deleted.  The Responder never initiates retransmission,
          but it must send a response message again in case it receives a retransmitted request.
        </t>
        <t>When IKEv2 uses a reliable transport protocol, like TCP, the retransmission rules are as follows:
        </t>
	
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The exchange Initiator <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> retransmit request message (*); if
            no response is received within some reasonable period of time, the
            IKE SA is deleted.
            </li>
          <li>If a new TCP connection for the IKE SA is established while the exchange
            Initiator is waiting for a response, the Initiator <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
            retransmit its request over this connection and continue to wait for a response.
            </li>
          <li>The exchange Responder does not change its behavior, but acts as
			described in <xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1"/>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          (*) This is an optimization; implementations may continue to use the retransmission logic from

        <name>Cookies and Puzzles</name>
        <t>IKEv2 provides a DoS attack protection mechanism through Cookies, which
          is described in <xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="2.6"/>.  <xref target="RFC8019" format="default"/> extends this
          mechanism for protection against DDoS attacks by means of Client
          Puzzles.  Both mechanisms allow the Responder to avoid keeping state until
          the Initiator proves its IP address is legitimate (and after solving a puzzle if required).
        </t>
        <t>The connection-oriented nature of TCP transport brings additional 
          considerations for using these mechanisms.
          In general, Cookies provide less value in the case of TCP encapsulation; by the time a Responder receives the IKE_SA_INIT request, the TCP
          session has already been established and the Initiator's IP address
          has been verified.  Moreover, a TCP/IP stack creates state once
          a TCP SYN packet is received (unless SYN Cookies described in <xref target="RFC4987" format="default"/>
          are employed), which contradicts the statelessness of IKEv2 Cookies.
          In particular, with TCP, an attacker is able to mount a SYN flooding DoS attack 
          that an IKEv2 Responder cannot prevent using stateless IKEv2 Cookies.
          Thus, when using TCP encapsulation, it makes little sense to send Cookie requests without 
          Puzzles unless the Responder is concerned with a possibility of TCP
          sequence number attacks (see <xref target="RFC6528"/> and <xref target="RFC9293" format="default"/> for details). Puzzles, on
		  the other hand, still remain useful (and their use requires using Cookies).
        </t>
        <t>The following considerations are applicable for using Cookie and
          Puzzle mechanisms in the case of TCP encapsulation:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The exchange Responder <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> send an IKEv2 Cookie request without an accompanied Puzzle;
		    implementations might choose to have exceptions to this for cases like mitigating TCP sequence number attacks.
            </li>
          <li>If the Responder chooses to send a Cookie request (possibly along
            with Puzzle request), then the TCP connection that the IKE_SA_INIT
            request message was received over <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be closed after the Responder sends its reply
            and no repeated requests are received within some short period of time 
            to keep the Responder stateless (see <xref target="tradeoff" format="default"/>). Note that the Responder <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> 
            include the Initiator's TCP port into the Cookie
			calculation (*) since the Cookie can be returned over a new
			TCP connection with a different port.
            </li>
          <li>The exchange Initiator acts as described in <xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="2.6"/> and <xref target="RFC8019" sectionFormat="of" section="7"/>, i.e., using TCP encapsulation doesn't change the Initiator's behavior.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>

          (*) Examples of Cookie calculation methods are given in <xref
          target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="2.6"/> and in <xref
          target="RFC8019" sectionFormat="of" section="7.1.1.3"/>, and they don't
          include transport protocol ports.  However, these examples are given
          for illustrative purposes since the Cookie generation algorithm is a
          local matter and some implementations might include port numbers
          that won't work with TCP encapsulation. Note also that these
          examples include the Initiator's IP address in Cookie calculation.
          In general, this address may change between two initial requests
          (with and without Cookies).  This may happen due to NATs, which
          have more freedom to change source IP addresses for new TCP
          connections than for UDP. In such cases, cookie verification might
          fail.

            There is a trade-off in choosing the period of time after which
            the TCP connection is closed. If it is too short, then the proper Initiator
            that repeats its request would need to re-establish the TCP connection,
            introducing additional delay. On the other hand, if it is too long, then 
            the Responder's resources would be wasted in case the Initiator never comes back.   
            This document doesn't mandate the duration of time because it doesn't affect interoperability, 
            but it is believed that 5-10 seconds is a good compromise. Also, note that if the Responder requests that 
            the Initiator solve a puzzle, then the Responder can estimate how long it would take the Initiator 
            to find a solution and adjust the time interval accordingly.

        act immediately after receiving an error notification; instead, it should
        wait some time for a valid response since the IKE_SA_INIT
        messages are completely unauthenticated.  This advice does not apply
        equally in the case of TCP encapsulation.  If the Initiator receives a
        response message over TCP, then either this message is genuine and was
        sent by the peer or the TCP session was hijacked and the message is
        forged. In the latter case, no genuine messages from the Responder
        will be received.

        <name>Implications of TCP Encapsulation on IPsec SA Processing</name>
        <t>Using TCP encapsulation affects some aspects of IPsec SA processing.
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li><xref target="RFC4301" sectionFormat="of" section="8.1"/> requires all tunnel mode IPsec SAs to
            be able to copy the Don't Fragment (DF) bit from inner IPv4 header to
            the outer (tunnel) one.  With TCP encapsulation, this is generally
            not possible because the TCP/IP stack manages the DF bit in the outer IPv4
            header, and usually the stack ensures that the DF bit is set for TCP
            packets to avoid IP fragmentation. Note, that this behavior is 
            compliant with generic tunneling considerations since the outer TCP header acts
            as a link-layer protocol and its fragmentation and reassembly have no correlation with
            the inner payload. 
            </li>
          <li>The other feature that is less applicable with TCP encapsulation is an
            ability to split traffic of different QoS classes into different
            IPsec SAs, created by a single IKE SA.  In this case, the
            Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field is usually copied
            from the inner IP header to the outer (tunnel) one, ensuring that
            IPsec traffic of each SA receives the corresponding level of service.
            With TCP encapsulation, all IPsec SAs created by a single IKE SA will
            share a single TCP connection; thus, they will receive the same level of
            service (see <xref target="perf.3" format="default"/>).  If this functionality is needed, 
            implementations should create several IKE SAs each over separate TCP connections 
            and assign a corresponding DSCP value to each of them.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <t>TCP encapsulation of IPsec packets may have implications
          on performance of the encapsulated traffic. Performance considerations
          are discussed in <xref target="perf" format="default"/>.

      <name>Interaction with IKEv2 Extensions</name>
      <section anchor="mobike" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>MOBIKE Protocol</name>
        <t>The MOBIKE protocol, which allows SAs to migrate between IP
          addresses, is defined in <xref target="RFC4555" format="default"/>; <xref target="RFC4621" format="default"/> further clarifies
          the details of the protocol. When an IKE session that has negotiated MOBIKE is
          transitioning between networks, the Initiator of the transition may
          switch between using TCP encapsulation, UDP encapsulation, or no
          encapsulation.  Implementations that implement both MOBIKE and TCP
          encapsulation within the same connection configuration 
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support dynamically enabling and disabling TCP
          encapsulation as interfaces change.
        </t>
        <t>When a MOBIKE-enabled Initiator changes networks, the 
          INFORMATIONAL exchange with the UPDATE_SA_ADDRESSES notification <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be initiated 
          first over UDP before attempting over TCP.  If there is a response to the
          request sent over UDP, then the ESP packets should be sent directly over IP or over UDP port 4500 
          (depending on if a NAT was detected), regardless of if a connection on a previous
          network was using TCP encapsulation.  If no response is received within a certain period of time after
          several retransmissions, the Initiator ought to change its transport for this exchange from
          UDP to TCP and resend the request message. A new INFORMATIONAL exchange <bcp14>MUST
          NOT</bcp14> be started in this situation. If the Responder only responds to the request sent over TCP, then
          the ESP packets should be sent over the TCP connection, regardless of
          if a connection on a previous network did not use TCP encapsulation.
        </t>
        <t>The value of the timeout and the specific number of retransmissions before switching to
          TCP can vary depending on the Initiator's configuration. Implementations ought to provide
          reasonable defaults to ensure that UDP attempts have a chance to succeed, but can shorten
          the timeout based on historical data or metrics.
        </t>
        <t>If the TCP transport was used for the previous network connection, the old TCP
          connection <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be closed by the Initiator once MOBIKE finishes migration 
          to a new connection (either TCP or UDP).
        </t>
        <t>Since switching from UDP to TCP can happen during a single
		  INFORMATIONAL message exchange, the content of the NAT_DETECTION_*_IP
		  notifications will in most cases be incorrect (since UDP and TCP ports
		  will most likely be different), and the peer may incorrectly detect
		  the presence of a NAT. <xref target="RFC4555" sectionFormat="of" section="3.5"/> states that 
          a new INFORMATIONAL exchange with the UPDATE_SA_ADDRESSES notify is initiated 
          in case the address (or transport) is changed while waiting for a response.
        </t>
        <t><xref target="RFC4555" sectionFormat="of" section="3.5"/> also states that 
          once an IKE SA is switched to a new IP address, all outstanding requests in this SA 
          are immediately retransmitted using this address. See also <xref target="retr" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>The MOBIKE protocol defines the NO_NATS_ALLOWED notification that can be
          used to detect the presence of NAT between peer and to refuse to
          communicate in this situation.  In the case of TCP, the NO_NATS_ALLOWED
          notification <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be ignored because TCP generally has no problems
          with NAT boxes.
        </t>
        <t><xref target="RFC4555" sectionFormat="of" section="3.7"/> describes an additional optional step in the
          process of changing IP addresses called "Return Routability Check".  It
          is performed by Responders in order to be sure that the new
          Initiator's address is, in fact, routable.
In the case of TCP encapsulation, this check has little value since a
TCP handshake proves the routability of the TCP Originator's address;
thus, the Return Routability Check <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be performed.

        <name>IKE Redirect</name>
        <t>A redirect mechanism for IKEv2 is defined in <xref target="RFC5685" format="default"/>.  This mechanism
          allows security gateways to redirect clients to another gateway
          either during IKE SA establishment or after session setup.  If a
          client is connecting to a security gateway using TCP and
          then is redirected to another security gateway, the client
          needs to reset its transport selection.

In other words, with the next security gateway, the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> first try UDP and then fall
back to TCP while establishing a new IKE SA, regardless of the transport of
the SA the redirect notification was received over (unless the client's
configuration instructs it to instantly use TCP for the gateway it is
redirected to).

      <section anchor="resumption" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IKEv2 Session Resumption</name>
        <t>Session resumption for IKEv2 is defined in <xref target="RFC5723" format="default"/>.  Once an IKE SA is
          established, the server creates a resumption ticket where information
          about this SA is stored and transfers this ticket to the client.
          The ticket may be later used to resume the IKE SA after it is deleted.
          In the event of resumption, the client presents the ticket in a new
          exchange, called IKE_SESSION_RESUME.  Some parameters in the new SA
          are retrieved from the ticket and others are renegotiated (more details
          are given in <xref target="RFC5723" sectionFormat="of" section="5"/>).  
        </t>
        <t>Since network conditions may change while the client is inactive,
          the fact that TCP encapsulation was used in an old SA <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> affect which transport
          is used during session resumption. In other words, the transport should be 
          selected as if the IKE SA is being created from scratch.

      <section anchor="ha" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>IKEv2 Protocol Support for High Availability</name>
        <t><xref target="RFC6311" format="default"/> defines a support for High Availability in IKEv2.
          In case of cluster failover, a new active node
          must immediately initiate a special INFORMATION exchange containing the
          IKEV2_MESSAGE_ID_SYNC notification, which instructs the client to
          skip some number of Message IDs that might not be synchronized yet
          between nodes at the time of failover.
        </t>
        <t>Synchronizing states when using TCP encapsulation is much harder than
          when using UDP; doing so requires access to TCP/IP stack internals, which is
          not always available from an IKE/IPsec implementation.  If a cluster
          implementation doesn't synchronize TCP states between nodes, then
          after failover event the new active node will not have any TCP
          connection with the client, so the node cannot initiate the
          INFORMATIONAL exchange as required by <xref target="RFC6311" format="default"/>.  Since the cluster
          usually acts as TCP Responder, the new active node cannot re- establish TCP connection because only the TCP Originator can do it.
          For the client, the cluster failover event may remain
          undetected for long time if it has no IKE or ESP traffic to send.  Once
          the client sends an ESP or IKEv2 packet, the cluster node will reply
          with TCP RST and the client (as TCP Originator) will reestablish the TCP
          connection so that the node will be able to initiate the
          INFORMATIONAL exchange informing the client about the cluster
          failover.
        </t>
        <t>This document makes the following recommendation: if support for High
          Availability in IKEv2 is negotiated and TCP transport is used,
		  a client that is a TCP Originator <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> periodically send
          IKEv2 messages (e.g., by initiating liveness check exchange) whenever
          there is no IKEv2 or ESP traffic.  This differs from the
          recommendations given in <xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="2.4"/> in the following:
          the liveness check should be periodically performed even if the
          client has nothing to send over ESP.  The frequency of sending such
          messages should be high enough to allow quick detection and restoration
          of broken TCP connections.

        <t>IKE message fragmentation <xref target="RFC7383" format="default"/> is not required when using TCP
          encapsulation since a TCP stream already handles the fragmentation
          of its contents across packets.  Since fragmentation is redundant in
          this case, implementations might choose to not negotiate IKE
          fragmentation.  Even if fragmentation is negotiated, an
          implementation <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> send fragments when going over a TCP
          connection, although it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support receiving fragments.

      <t>Several aspects of TCP encapsulation for IKE and IPsec packets may
        negatively impact the performance of connections within a tunnel-mode
        IPsec SA.  Implementations should be aware of these performance
        impacts and take these into consideration when determining when to
        use TCP encapsulation.  Implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> favor using direct ESP
        or UDP encapsulation over TCP encapsulation whenever possible.

        <name>TCP-in-TCP</name>
        <t>If the outer connection between IKE peers is over TCP, inner TCP
          connections may suffer negative effects from using TCP within TCP.
          Running TCP within TCP is discouraged since the TCP algorithms
          generally assume that they are running over an unreliable datagram
          layer.
        </t>
        <t>If the outer (tunnel) TCP connection experiences packet loss, this
          loss will be hidden from any inner TCP connections since the outer
          connection will retransmit to account for the losses.  Since the
          outer TCP connection will deliver the inner messages in order, any
          messages after a lost packet may have to wait until the loss is
          recovered.  This means that loss on the outer connection will be
          interpreted only as delay by inner connections.  The burstiness of
          inner traffic can increase since a large number of inner packets may
          be delivered across the tunnel at once.  The inner TCP connection may
          interpret a long period of delay as a transmission problem,
          triggering a retransmission timeout, which will cause spurious
          retransmissions.  The sending rate of the inner connection may be
          unnecessarily reduced if the retransmissions are not detected as
          spurious in time.
        </t>
        <t>The inner TCP connection's round-trip-time estimation will be
          affected by the burstiness of the outer TCP connection if there are
          long delays when packets are retransmitted by the outer TCP
          connection.  This will make the congestion control loop of the inner
          TCP traffic less reactive, potentially permanently leading to a lower
          sending rate than the outer TCP would allow for.
        </t>
        <t> TCP-in-TCP can also lead to "TCP meltdown", where stacked instances
          of TCP can result in significant impacts to performance
          <xref target="TCP-MELTDOWN" format="default"/>. This can occur when losses in the lower TCP (closer to the link)
          increase delays seen by the higher TCP (closer to the application) that create
          timeouts, which, in turn, cause retransmissions that can then cause losses in 
          the lower TCP by overrunning its buffer. The very mechanism intended to avoid loss
          (retransmission) interacts between the two layers to increase loss. To limit this effect,
          the timeouts of the two TCP layers need to be carefully managed, e.g., such that
          the higher layer has a much longer timeout than the lower layer.
        </t>
        <t>Note that any negative effects will be shared among all flows going
          through the outer TCP connection.  This is of particular concern for
          any latency-sensitive or real-time applications using the tunnel.  If
          such traffic is using a TCP-encapsulated IPsec connection, it is
          recommended that the number of inner connections sharing the tunnel
          be limited as much as possible.

      </t>
      <t>TCP connections are also susceptible to RST and other spoofing attacks <xref target="RFC4953" format="default"/>.
        This specification makes IPsec tolerant of sudden TCP connection drops, but if an attacker
        is able to tear down TCP connections, IPsec connection's performance can suffer, 
        effectively making this a DoS attack. 
      </t>
      <t>TCP data injection attacks have no effect on application data since IPsec provides data integrity.
        However, they can have some effect, mostly by creating DoS attacks:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>If an attacker alters the content of the Length field that separates packets,

          Length field happens to be 0 or 1 (see <xref target="format" format="default"/>).
          </li>
        <li>If the content of an IKE message is altered, then it will be dropped by the receiver;

        <li>If an attacker modifies TCP-Encapsulated stream prefix or unencrypted IKE messages before IKE SA is established,

        <xref target="RFC5961" format="default"/> discusses how TCP injection attacks can be mitigated.
      </t>
      <t>Note that data injection attacks are also possible on IP level (e.g., when IP fragmentation is used),
        resulting in DoS attacks even if TCP encapsulation is not used. On the other hand, TCP injection attacks are easier to mount 
        than the IP fragmentation injection attacks because TCP keeps a long receive window open that's a sitting target for such attacks. 
      </t>
      <t>If an attacker successfully mounts an injection attack on a TCP connection used for encapsulating IPsec traffic 
        and modifies a Length field, the receiver might not be able to correctly identify the boundaries of the following packets in the stream
        since it will try to parse arbitrary data as an ESP or IKE header.
        After such a parsing failure, all following packets will be dropped. Communication will eventually recover, but this might
        take several minutes and can result in IKE SA deletion and re-creation.
      </t>
      <t>To speed up the recovery from such attacks, implementations are advised to follow recommendations in <xref target="establish" format="default"/> and close 
        the TCP connection if incoming packets contain SPIs that don't match any known SAs.
        Once the TCP connection is closed, it will be re-created by the TCP Originator as described in <xref target="establish" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>To avoid performance degradation caused by closing and re-creating TCP connections, 
	implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> alternatively try to resync after they receive unknown SPIs by searching the TCP stream
        for a 64-bit binary vector consisting of a known SPI in the first 32 bits and a valid Sequence Number for this SPI in the
        second 32 bits. Then, they can validate the Integrity Check Value (ICV) of this packet candidate by taking the preceding 16 bits as the Length field.




They can also search for 4 bytes of zero (non-ESP marker) followed by
128 bits of IKE SPIs of the IKE SA(s) associated with this TCP connection and
then validate the ICV of this IKE message candidate by taking the 16 bits
preceding the non-ESP marker as the Length field.



	
       Implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> limit the attempts to resync, because if the
  injection attack is ongoing, then there is a high probability that
  the resync process will not succeed or will quickly come under attack
  again.

      </t>
      <t>An attacker capable of blocking UDP traffic can force peers to use TCP encapsulation,
        thus, degrading the performance and making the connection more vulnerable to DoS attacks.
        Note that an attacker that is able to modify packets on the wire or to block them can
        prevent peers from communicating regardless of the transport being used.
      </t>
      <t>TCP Responders should be careful to ensure that the stream prefix
        "IKETCP" uniquely identifies incoming streams as streams that use the
        TCP encapsulation protocol.
      </t>
      <t>Attackers may be able to disrupt the TCP connection by sending
        spurious TCP Reset packets.  Therefore, implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> make
        sure that IKE session state persists even if the underlying TCP
        connection is torn down.
      </t>
      <t>If MOBIKE is being used, all of the security considerations outlined
        for MOBIKE apply <xref target="RFC4555" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>Similar to MOBIKE, TCP encapsulation requires a TCP Responder to
        handle changes to source address and port due to network or
        connection disruption.  The successful delivery of valid new IKE or ESP
        messages over a new TCP connection is used by the TCP Responder to
        determine where to send subsequent responses.  If an attacker is able
        to send packets on a new TCP connection that pass the validation
        checks of the TCP Responder, it can influence which path future
        packets will take.  For this reason, the validation of messages on
        the TCP Responder must include decryption, authentication, and replay
        checks.

      <name>Using TCP Encapsulation with TLS</name>
      <t>This section provides recommendations on how to use TLS in addition
          to TCP encapsulation.
      </t>
      <t>When using TCP encapsulation, implementations may choose to use TLS 1.2
          <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/> or TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/> on the TCP connection 
          to be able to traverse middleboxes, which may otherwise block the traffic.
      </t>
      <t>If a web proxy is applied to the ports used for the TCP connection
          and TLS is being used, the TCP Originator can send an HTTP CONNECT
          message to establish an SA through the proxy <xref target="RFC2817" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>The use of TLS should be configurable on the peers and may be used
          as the default when using TCP encapsulation or may be used as a
          fallback when basic TCP encapsulation fails.  The TCP Responder may
          expect to read encapsulated IKE and ESP packets directly from the TCP
          connection, or it may expect to read them from a stream of TLS data
          packets.  The TCP Originator should be preconfigured regarding whether or not to use TLS
          when communicating with a given port on the TCP Responder.
      </t>
      <t>When new TCP connections are re-established due to a broken
          connection, TLS must be renegotiated.  TLS session resumption is
          recommended to improve efficiency in this case.
      </t>
      <t>The security of the IKE session is entirely derived from the IKE
          negotiation and key establishment and not from the TLS session (which,
          in this context, is only used for encapsulation purposes); therefore,
          when TLS is used on the TCP connection, both the TCP Originator and
          the TCP Responder <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> allow the NULL cipher to be selected for
          performance reasons. Note that TLS 1.3 only supports AEAD algorithms
          and at the time of writing this document there was no recommended cipher suite 
          for TLS 1.3 with the NULL cipher. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to follow 
          <xref target="RFC9325" format="default"/> when selecting parameters for TLS.
      </t>
      <t>Implementations should be aware that the use of TLS introduces
          another layer of overhead requiring more bytes to transmit a given
          IKE and IPsec packet.  For this reason, direct ESP, UDP
          encapsulation, or TCP encapsulation without TLS should be preferred
          in situations in which TLS is not required in order to traverse
          middleboxes.

        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>During the IKE_AUTH exchange, the client and server exchange
              MOBIKE_SUPPORTED notify payloads to indicate support for MOBIKE.
              </li>
          <li>The client changes its point of attachment to the network and
              receives a new IP address.  The client attempts to re-establish
              the IKE session using the UPDATE_SA_ADDRESSES notify payload, but
              the server does not respond because the network blocks UDP
              traffic.
              </li>
          <li>The client brings up a TCP connection to the server in order to
              use TCP encapsulation.
              </li>
          <li>The client initiates a TLS handshake with the server.</li>
          <li>The client sends the stream prefix for TCP-encapsulated IKE
              traffic (<xref target="prefix" format="default"/>).
              </li>
          <li>The client sends the UPDATE_SA_ADDRESSES notify payload in the 
              INFORMATIONAL exchange on the
              TCP-encapsulated connection.  Note that this IKE message is the
              same as the one sent over UDP in step 2; it should have the same
              message ID and contents.
              </li>
          <li>Once the client receives a response on the
              TCP-encapsulated connection, it immediately starts a new INFORMATIONAL
              exchange with an UPDATE_SA_ADDRESSES notify payload and recalculated 
              NAT_DETECTION_*_IP notify payloads in order to get correct information about the presence 
              of NATs.
