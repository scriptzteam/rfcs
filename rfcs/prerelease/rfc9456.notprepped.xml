    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates RFC 6353 ("Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
          Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)")
          to reflect changes necessary to support Transport Layer Security 
          version 1.3 (TLS 1.3) and Datagram Transport Layer Security version 
          1.3 (DTLS 1.3), which are jointly known as "(D)TLS 1.3". This 
          document is compatible with (D)TLS 1.2 and is intended to be 
          compatible with future versions of SNMP and (D)TLS. </t>
      <t>This document updates the SNMP-TLS-TM-MIB as defined in RFC 6353.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document updates and clarifies how the rules of <xref target="RFC6353"
          format="default"/> apply when using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or
		  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) versions later than 1.2. This
	      document jointly refers to these two protocols as "(D)TLS". The update also 
	  	  emphasizes the requirement in <xref target="RFC8996" format="default"/> prohibiting the use of TLS versions prior to TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> when using SNMP. Although the text of this 
		  document specifically references SNMPv3 and (D)TLS 1.3, this document may be
	      applicable to future versions of these protocols and is backwards compatible with 
          (D)TLS 1.2.</t>
     <section anchor="sect-1.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>The Internet-Standard Management Framework</name>
     <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <xref target="RFC3410" sectionFormat="of" section="7"/>.</t>
     <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in RFCs 2578, 2579, and 2580 <xref target="STD58"/>.</t>
     </section>

      <section anchor="sect-1.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Conventions </name>
        <t> Within this document, the terms "TLS", "DTLS", and "(D)TLS" apply to all 
			versions of the indicated protocols. The term "SNMP" means "SNMPv3" unless a 
			specific version number is indicated. Specific version numbers are used when 
			the text needs to emphasize version numbers.</t>
        <t> For consistency with SNMP-related specifications, this document favors terminology as
          defined in <xref target="STD62" format="default"/>, rather than favoring terminology that
          is consistent with non-SNMP specifications. This is consistent with the IESG decision to
          not require that the SNMP terminology be modified to match the usage of other non-SNMP
          specifications when SNMP was advanced to an Internet Standard. "Authentication" in this
          document typically refers to the English meaning of "serving to prove the authenticity of"
          the message, not data source authentication or peer identity authentication. The terms
          "manager" and "agent" are not used in this document because, in the 
          architecture defined in RFC 3411 <xref target="STD62"/>, all SNMP entities have the capability of acting as
          manager, agent, or both, depending on the SNMP application types supported in the
          implementation. Where distinction is necessary, the application names of command
          generator, command responder, notification originator, notification receiver, and proxy
          forwarder are used. See "An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks" (RFC 3411 <xref target="STD62"/>)
          for further information. </t>
        <t> Throughout this document, the terms "client" and "server" are used to refer to the two
          ends of the TLS transport connection. The client actively opens the TLS connection, and
          the server passively listens for the incoming TLS connection. An SNMP entity
            <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> act as a TLS client, TLS server, or both, depending on the SNMP
          applications supported. </t>
        <t> Throughout this document, the term "session" is used to refer to a secure 
        	association between two instances of the TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) that permits
        	the transmission of one or more SNMP messages within the lifetime of the session. 
        	The TLS protocol also has an internal notion of a session, and although these two 
        	concepts of a session are related, when the term "session" is used, this document 
        	is referring to the TLSTM's specific session and not directly to the TLS protocol's 
        	session. </t>
       <t>The key words "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>", "<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>",
       "<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>",

      <name>Changes from RFC 6353</name>
      <t> This document updates <xref target="RFC6353"/>. The changes from <xref target="RFC6353"/>
        are defined in the following subsections. </t>

      <section anchor="sect-2.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>TLSTM Fingerprint</name>
        <t><xref target="RFC6353" format="default"/> defines the SnmpTLSFingerprint textual convention to include the one-octet TLS 1.2 hash algorithm identifier. This one-octet algorithm identifier is only applicable to (D)TLS protocol versions prior to 1.3. The TLS community does not plan to ever add additional values to 
			the "TLS HashAlgorithm" registry <xref target="RFC5246"/>, because some might incorrectly infer that 
			using a new hash algorithm with TLS 1.2 would overcome the limitations of TLS 
			1.2. However, there is still a need within TLSTM to support new values as they 
			are developed.</t>    
          
        <t>This document updates the definition of SnmpTLSFingerprint to clarify
that the one-octet algorithm identifier uses the values in the IANA
"SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms" registry; this registry is consistent
with the IANA "TLS HashAlgorithm" registry for its initial values
but can be extended as needed to support new hashing algorithms
without implying that the new values can be used by TLS version 1.2.
 This change allows the reuse of the existing fingerprint 
			textual convention and minimizes the impact to <xref target="RFC6353" format="default"/>.</t>
			<t>   A "Y" in the "Recommended" column (<xref target="table_1"/>) indicates that the registered value 
      has been recommended through a formal Standards Action <xref target="RFC8126"/>.  Not all parameters
      defined in Standards Track documents are necessarily marked as "Recommended".</t>
      <t>An "N" in the "Recommended" column does not necessarily mean that the value is flawed; 
      	rather, it indicates that the item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, 
      	has limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.</t> 
			<t>The initial values for the "SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms"
registry are defined below:</t>

      <section anchor="sect-3.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Zero Round-Trip Time Resumption (0-RTT)</name>
        <t> TLS 1.3 implementations for SNMP <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> enable the 0-RTT mode of session 
            resumption (either sending or accepting) and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> automatically resend 
            0-RTT data if it is rejected by the server. 0-RTT is disallowed because there are 
            no "safe" SNMP messages that, if replayed, will be guaranteed to cause no harm at the server side: all
          incoming notifications or command responses are meant to be acted upon only once. See <xref target="sect-5"/> ("<xref target="sect-5" format="title"/>") for further details. </t>
        <t>TLSTM clients and servers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> request, offer, or use the 0-RTT mode of TLS 1.3.
            <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/> removed the renegotiation supported in TLS 1.2
            <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/>; for session resumption, it introduced a
          zero-RTT (0-RTT) mode, saving a round trip at connection setup at the cost of increased
          risk of replay attacks (it is possible for servers to guard against this attack by keeping
          track of all the messages received). <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/> requires that a 
          profile be written for any application that wants to use 0-RTT, specifying which messages are 
          "safe to use" with this mode. Within SNMP, there are no messages that are "safe to use" with this mode.</t>
        <t>Renegotiation of sessions is not supported, as it is not supported by TLS 1.3.  If a future version 
        	of TLS supports renegotiation, this RFC should be updated to indicate whether there are any additional 
        	requirements related to its use.</t>

        described in RFC 5952), surrounded by square brackets
        ('[', ASCII character 0x5B, and ']', ASCII character
        0x5D), followed by a colon ':' (ASCII character 0x3A)
        and a decimal port number in ASCII.

        A host name MUST be in ASCII (as per RFC 1123);
        internationalized host names MUST be encoded as A-labels as
        specified in RFC 5890.  The host name is followed by a
        colon ':' (ASCII character 0x3A) and a decimal port
        number in ASCII.  The name SHOULD be fully qualified
        whenever possible.

        Values of this textual convention are not guaranteed to be
        directly usable as transport-layer addressing information,
        potentially requiring additional processing, such as
        run-time resolution.  As such, applications that write
        them MUST be prepared for handling errors if such values
        are not supported or cannot be resolved (if resolution
        occurs at the time of the management operation).

        The DESCRIPTION clause of TransportAddress objects that
        may have SnmpTLSAddress values MUST fully describe how
        (and when) such names are to be resolved to IP addresses
        and vice versa.

        This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in
        object definitions, since it restricts addresses to a
        specific format.  However, if it is used, it MAY be used
        either on its own or in conjunction with
        TransportAddressType or TransportDomain as a pair.

        When this textual convention is used as a syntax of an
        index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
        sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2 (STD 58).  It is
        RECOMMENDED that all MIB documents using this textual
        convention make explicit any limitations on index
        component lengths that management software MUST observe.
        This MAY be done by either 1) including SIZE constraints
        on the index components or 2) specifying applicable
        constraints in the conceptual row's DESCRIPTION clause or
        in the surrounding documentation."

    DESCRIPTION
       "A fingerprint value that can be used to uniquely reference
        other data of potentially arbitrary length.

        An SnmpTLSFingerprint value is composed of a one-octet
        hashing algorithm identifier followed by the fingerprint
        value.  The one-octet identifier value encoded is taken
        from the IANA 'SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms' registry.  The
        remaining octets of the SnmpTLSFingerprint value are
        filled using the results of the hashing algorithm.
       
        Historically, the one-octet hashing algorithm identifier
        was based on the IANA 'TLS HashAlgorithm' registry
        (RFC 5246); however, this registry is no longer in use for
        TLS 1.3 and above and is not expected to have any new
        registrations added to it.  To allow the fingerprint
        algorithm to support additional hashing algorithms that
        might be used by later versions of (D)TLS, the octet value
        encoded is now taken from the IANA
        'SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms' registry.  The initial values
        within this registry are identical to the values in the
        'TLS HashAlgorithm' registry but can be extended to
        support new hashing algorithms as needed. 
       
        This textual convention allows for a zero-length (blank)
        SnmpTLSFingerprint value for use in tables where the
        fingerprint value MAY be optional.  MIB definitions or
        implementations MAY refuse to accept a zero-length value
        as appropriate."

    DESCRIPTION
       "This table is used by a (D)TLS server to map the (D)TLS
        client's presented X.509 certificate to a tmSecurityName.

        On an incoming (D)TLS/SNMP connection, the client's
        presented certificate either MUST be validated based on an
        established trust anchor or MUST directly match a
        fingerprint in this table.  This table does not provide
        any mechanisms for configuring the trust anchors; the
        transfer of any needed trusted certificates for path
        validation is expected to occur through an out-of-band
        transfer.

        Once the certificate has been found acceptable (either via
        path validation or by directly matching a fingerprint in
        this table), this table is consulted to determine the
        appropriate tmSecurityName to identify with the remote
        connection.  This is done by considering each active row
        from this table in prioritized order according to its
        snmpTlstmCertToTSNID value.  Each row's
        snmpTlstmCertToTSNFingerprint value determines whether the
        row is a match for the incoming connection:

           1) If the row's snmpTlstmCertToTSNFingerprint value
              identifies the presented certificate, then consider
              the row as a successful match.

           2) If the row's snmpTlstmCertToTSNFingerprint value
              identifies a locally held copy of a trusted CA
              certificate and that CA certificate was used to
              validate the path to the presented certificate, then
              consider the row as a successful match.

        Once a matching row has been found, the
        snmpTlstmCertToTSNMapType value can be used to determine
        how the tmSecurityName to associate with the session
        should be determined.  See the 'snmpTlstmCertToTSNMapType'
        column's DESCRIPTION clause for details on determining the
        tmSecurityName value.  If it is impossible to determine a
        tmSecurityName from the row's data combined with the data
        presented in the certificate, then additional rows MUST be
        searched to look for another potential match.  If a
        resulting tmSecurityName mapped from a given row is not
        compatible with the needed requirements of a
        tmSecurityName (e.g., the VACM imposes a 32-octet-maximum
        length and the certificate-derived securityName could be
        longer), then it MUST be considered an invalid match and
        additional rows MUST be searched to look for another
        potential match.

        If no matching and valid row can be found, the connection
        MUST be closed and SNMP messages MUST NOT be accepted over
        it.

        Missing values of snmpTlstmCertToTSNID are acceptable, and
        implementations SHOULD continue to the
        next-highest-numbered row.  It is RECOMMENDED that
        administrators skip index values to leave room for the
        insertion of future rows (for example, use values of 10
        and 20 when creating initial rows).

        Users are encouraged to make use of certificates with
        subjectAltName fields that can be used as tmSecurityNames.
        This allows all child certificates of a single root CA
        certificate to include a subjectAltName that maps directly
        to a tmSecurityName via a 1:1 transformation.  However,
        this table is flexible, to allow for situations where
        existing deployed certificate infrastructures do not provide
        adequate subjectAltName values for use as tmSecurityNames.
        Certificates MAY also be mapped to tmSecurityNames using
        the CommonName portion of the Subject field.  However, the
        usage of the CommonName field is deprecated, and thus this
        usage is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Direct mapping from each
        individual certificate fingerprint to a tmSecurityName is
        also possible but requires one entry in the table per
        tmSecurityName and requires more management operations to
        completely configure a device."

    DESCRIPTION
       "This table is used by a (D)TLS client when a (D)TLS
        connection is being set up using an entry in the
        SNMP-TARGET-MIB.  It extends the SNMP-TARGET-MIB's
        snmpTargetAddrTable so that the client can verify that the
        correct server has been reached.  This verification can
        use either 1) a certificate fingerprint or 2) an
        identity authenticated via certification path validation.

        If there is an active row in this table corresponding to
        the entry in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB that was used to
        establish the connection and the row's
        'snmpTlstmAddrServerFingerprint' column has a non-empty
        value, then the server's presented certificate is compared
        with the snmpTlstmAddrServerFingerprint value (and the
        'snmpTlstmAddrServerIdentity' column is ignored).  If the
        fingerprint matches, the verification has succeeded.  If
        the fingerprint does not match, then the connection MUST
        be closed.

        If the server's presented certificate has passed
        certification path validation (RFC 5280) to a configured
        trust anchor and an active row exists with a zero-length
        snmpTlstmAddrServerFingerprint value, then the
        'snmpTlstmAddrServerIdentity' column contains the expected
        host name.  This expected host name is then compared
        against the server's certificate as follows:

           - Implementations MUST support matching the expected
             host name against a dNSName in the subjectAltName
             extension field and MAY support checking the name
             against the CommonName portion of the subject
             distinguished name.

           - The '*' (ASCII 0x2A) wildcard character is allowed in
             the dNSName of the subjectAltName extension (and in
             CommonName, if used to store the host name), but
             only as the leftmost (least significant) DNS label
             in that value.  This wildcard matches any leftmost
             DNS label in the server name.  That is, the subject
             *.example.com matches the server names a.example.com
             and b.example.com but does not match example.com or
             a.b.example.com.  Implementations MUST support
             wildcards in certificates as specified above but MAY
             provide a configuration option to disable them.

           - If the locally configured name is an
             internationalized domain name, conforming
             implementations MUST convert it to the ASCII
             Compatible Encoding (ACE) format for performing
             comparisons, as specified in Section 7 of RFC 5280.

        If the expected host name fails these conditions, then the
        connection MUST be closed.

        If there is no row in this table corresponding to the
        entry in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and the server can be
        authorized by another, implementation-dependent means,
        then the connection MAY still proceed."

      <t> This document updates a transport model that permits SNMP to utilize (D)TLS security

        considerations for TLS are described in 
Section&nbsp;<xref target="RFC8446" section="10" sectionFormat="bare"/> and
Appendix&nbsp;<xref target="RFC8446" section="E" sectionFormat="bare"/> of TLS 1.3
<xref target="RFC8446"/>. Security considerations for DTLS are described in Section <xref target="RFC9147" sectionFormat="bare" section="11"/> of
DTLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC9147"/>.</t>
        <t>Implementations should consider the latest recommendations on the use of (DTLS), such as 
        	those documented in <xref target="RFC9325" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t> SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even if the network
          itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec), there is no control as to who
          on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
          objects in this MIB module.</t>
    <t>It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that only SNMPv3 messages using the Transport Security 
    	Model (TSM) or another secure-transport-aware security model be sent over the TLSTM transport.</t>

    <section anchor="sect-6" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
        <t>IANA has created a new registry called "SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms" within the "Structure of Management Information 
        	  (SMI) Numbers (MIB Module Registrations)" group. The description of this registry is
            "iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.snmpTlstmMIB.snmpTlstmHashAlgorithms
             (1.3.6.1.2.1.198.4)".</t>
        <t>The registry has the following fields: Value, Description, 
            Recommended, and References. The range of values is zero to 255, 
            with initial assignments shown in <xref target="sect-2.1"/>. The "Recommended" 
            column indicates "Y" for hashing algorithms that are Standards 
            Track and are deemed to be acceptable for widely applicable 
            current use and "N" for hashing algorithms that 
            reflect meanings that are not recommended (e.g., they do not 
            provide sufficient security for modern systems, they are not 
            Standards Track, and they have limited applicability). A
            blank field indicates that no recommendation is made (e.g., 
            because the value is unassigned or left for private use).</t>
         <t>This registry is expected to be updated infrequently; as such, 
         	its values are limited to one octet.</t>

		<t>The policy for updates to the "SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms" registry 
   is Expert Review <xref target="RFC8126"/>. Registry requests should be sent to the 
   <eref brackets="angle" target="mailto:snmp-tlstm-reg-review@ietf.org"/> mailing list. Registration requests 
   sent to the mailing list for review <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use an appropriate 
   subject (e.g., 'Request to register value in "SNMP-TLSTM 
   HashAlgorithms" registry'). In addition, designated experts should 
   consult with the
   <eref brackets="angle" target="mailto:tls-reg-review@ietf.org"/> mailing list to make sure 
   that any new hash algorithms are considered for inclusion in this 
   registry. </t>
   
   <t>Designated experts <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> ascertain the existence of suitable
   documentation that defines a hash algorithm and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also verify 
   that the request does not conflict with or duplicate other entries in the 
   registry. The experts should also provide a recommendation as to how 
   the "Recommended" column of the registry should be updated. Only 
   publicly available specifications that represent current industry-
   accepted practices should receive an assignment of "Y" in the 
   "Recommended" column; all other specific assignments in the registry 
   should receive an assignment of "N". Assignments that are nonspecific (e.g., 
   reserved values) <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> receive an assigned value for the 
   "Recommended" column.</t>
   
   <t>Within the three-week review period, the designated experts will 
   either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this
   decision to the review list and IANA. Denials <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> include an 
   explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the 
   request successful. Registration requests that are undetermined for 
   a period longer than three weeks can be brought to the IESG's attention 
   (using the <eref brackets="angle" target="mailto:iesg@ietf.org"/> mailing list) for resolution.</t>

      <t>IANA <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only accept registry updates from the designated experts
   and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list. While future additions to the "TLS HashAlgorithm"
   registry (i.e., the registry from which the "SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms"
   registry was spawned) are not expected, any future additions to the 
   "TLS HashAlgorithm" registry <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be consistent with the values 
   assigned in the "SNMP-TLSTM HashAlgorithms" registry.</t>
   
   <t>It is suggested that multiple designated experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed reviews of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular 
   expert, that expert <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> defer to the judgment of the other experts.</t>
