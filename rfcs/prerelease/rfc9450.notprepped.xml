    <abstract>
      <t>The wireless medium presents significant specific challenges to
      achieve properties similar to those of wired deterministic networks. At
      the same time, a number of use cases cannot be solved with wires and
      justify the extra effort of going wireless. This document presents
      wireless use cases (such as aeronautical communications, amusement
      parks, industrial applications, pro audio and video, gaming, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
      control, edge robotics, and emergency vehicles), demanding reliable and
      available behavior.

      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>Based on time, resource reservation, and policy enforcement by
      distributed shapers <xref target="RFC2475"/>, Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides the
      capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data streams for
      real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded
      latency so as to support time-sensitive and mission-critical
      applications on a converged enterprise infrastructure.
      </t>
      <t>DetNet aims at eliminating packet loss for a committed bandwidth,
      while ensuring a worst-case end-to-end latency, regardless of the
      network conditions and across technologies. By leveraging lower layer
      (Layer 2 (L2) and below) capabilities, Layer 3 (L3) can exploit the use
      of a service layer, steering over multiple technologies and using media
      independent signaling to provide high reliability, precise time
      delivery, and rate enforcement.  DetNet can be seen as
      a set of new Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees of worst-case
      delivery. IP networks become more deterministic when the effects of
      statistical multiplexing (jitter and collision loss) are mostly
      eliminated. 
   This requires a tight control of the physical resources
   to maintain the amount of traffic within the physical capabilities of
   the underlying technology, e.g., by using time-shared resources
   (bandwidth and buffers) per circuit, by shaping or scheduling
   the packets at every hop, or by using a combination of these 
   techniques.
      </t>
      <t>Key attributes of DetNet include:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>time synchronization on all the nodes,</li>
        <li>multi-technology path with co-channel interference
        minimization,</li>
        <li>frame preemption and guard time mechanisms to ensure a worst-case
        delay, and</li>
        <li>new traffic shapers, both within and at the edge, to protect the
        network.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Wireless operates on a shared medium, and transmissions cannot be
      guaranteed to be fully deterministic due to uncontrolled interferences,
      including self-induced multipath fading. The term RAW stands for
      "Reliable and Available Wireless" and refers to the mechanisms aimed for
      providing high reliability and availability for IP connectivity over a
      wireless medium. Making wireless reliable and available is even more
      challenging than it is with wires, due to the numerous causes of loss in
      transmission that add up to the congestion losses and due to the delays
      caused by overbooked shared resources.</t>
      <t>The wireless and wired media are fundamentally different at the
      physical level. While the generic Problem Statement in <xref
      target="RFC8557" format="default"/> for DetNet applies to the wired as
      well as the wireless medium, the methods to achieve RAW necessarily
      differ from those used to support Time-Sensitive Networking over wires,
      e.g., due to the wireless radio channel specifics.</t>
      <t>So far, open standards for DetNet have prevalently
      been focused on wired media, with Audio Video Bridging (AVB) and
      Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) at the IEEE and DetNet <xref
      target="RFC8655" format="default"/> at the IETF. However, wires cannot
      be used in several cases, including mobile or rotating devices,
      rehabilitated industrial buildings, wearable or in-body sensory devices,
      vehicle automation, and multiplayer gaming.
      </t>
      <t>Purpose-built wireless technologies such as <xref target="ISA100"
      format="default"/>, which incorporates IPv6, were developed and deployed
      to cope with the lack of open standards, but they yield a high cost in
      Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and are
      limited to very few industries, e.g., process control, concert
      instruments, or racing.
      </t>
      <t>This is now changing (as detailed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-raw-technologies"
      format="default"/>):</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>IMT-2020 has recognized Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication
        (URLLC) as a key functionality for the upcoming 5G.
        </li>
        <li>IEEE 802.11 has identified a set of real applications <xref
        target="IEEE80211RTA" format="default"/>, which may use the
        IEEE802.11 standards. They typically emphasize strict end-to-end delay
        requirements.
        </li>
        <li>The IETF has produced an IPv6 stack for IEEE Std. 802.15.4
        Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) and an architecture <xref
        target="RFC9030" format="default"/> that enables RAW on a shared MAC.
        </li>
      </ul>


        <t>Experiments have already been conducted with IEEE802.1 TSN over
        IEEE802.11be <xref target="IEEE80211BE" format="default"/>.  This mode
        enables time synchronization and time-aware scheduling (trigger based
        access mode) to support TSN flows.</t>
      <t>This document extends the "<xref target="RFC8578" format="title"/>"
      document <xref target="RFC8578" format="default"/> and describes several
      additional use cases that require "reliable/predictable and available"
      flows over wireless links and possibly complex multi-hop paths called
      "Tracks". This is covered mainly by the "Wireless for Industrial
      Applications" (<xref target="RFC8578" sectionFormat="of" section="5"/>)
      use case, as the "Cellular Radio" (<xref target="RFC8578"
      sectionFormat="of" section="6"/>) is mostly dedicated to the (wired)
      link part of a Radio Access Network (RAN). Whereas, while the "Wireless
      for Industrial Applications" use case certainly covers an area of
      interest for RAW, it is limited to IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE
      802.15.4e (6TiSCH), and thus, its scope is narrower than the use cases
      described next in this document.

      <t>Aircraft are currently connected to Air-Traffic Control (ATC) and
      Airline Operational Control (AOC) via voice and data communication
      systems through all phases of a flight. Within the airport terminal,
      connectivity is focused on high-bandwidth communications, whereas en route
      it's focused on high reliability, robustness, and range.

        <name>Problem Statement</name>
        <t>Up to 2020, civil air traffic had been growing constantly at a
        compound rate of 5.8% per year <xref target="ACI19" format="default"/>,
        and despite the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, air-traffic
        growth is expected to resume very quickly in post-pandemic times <xref
        target="IAT20" format="default"/> <xref target="IAC20"
        format="default"/>. Thus, legacy systems in Air-Traffic Management
        (ATM) are likely to reach their capacity limits, and the need for new
        aeronautical communication technologies becomes apparent. Especially
        problematic is the saturation of VHF band in high density areas in
        Europe, the US, and Asia <xref target="SESAR" format="default"/>
        <xref target="FAA20" format="default"/>, calling for suitable new
        digital approaches such as the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) for airport communications,
        SatCOM for remote domains, and the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (LDACS) as the long-range terrestrial
        aeronautical communication system. Making the frequency spectrum's
        usage a more efficient transition from analog voice to digital data
        communication <xref target="PLA14" format="default"/> is necessary to
        cope with the expected growth of civil aviation and its supporting
        infrastructure. A promising candidate for long-range terrestrial
        communications, already in the process of being standardized in the
        International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is LDACS <xref
        target="ICAO2022" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC9372"
        format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>Note that the large scale of the planned Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
        constellations of satellites can provide fast end-to-end latency rates and high
        data-rates at a reasonable cost, but they also pose challenges, such as
        frequent handovers, high interference, and a diverse range of system
        users, which can create security issues since both safety-critical and
        not safety-critical communications can take place on the same
        system. Some studies suggest that LEO constellations could be a
        complete solution for aeronautical communications, but they do not
        offer solutions for the critical issues mentioned
        earlier. Additionally, of the three communication domains defined by
        ICAO, only passenger entertainment services can currently be provided
        using these constellations. Safety-critical aeronautical
        communications require reliability levels above 99.999%, which is
        higher than that required for regular commercial data
        links. Therefore, addressing the issues with LEO-based SatCOM is
        necessary before these solutions can reliably support safety-critical
        data transmission <xref target="Maurer2022" format="default"/>.

replaced by digital data communication. This sets a paradigm shift from analog

increased autonomous data processing that the Future Communications
Infrastructure (FCI) in civil aviation must provide. The FCI is depicted in

        <name>The Need for Wireless</name>
        <t>In a high-mobility environment, such as aviation, the envisioned
        solutions to provide worldwide coverage of data connections with
        in-flight aircraft require a multi-system, multi-link, multi-hop
        approach. Thus, air, ground, and space-based data links that provide
        these technologies will have to operate seamlessly together to cope
        with the increasing needs of data exchange between aircraft,
        air-traffic controller, airport infrastructure, airlines, air network
        service providers (ANSPs), and so forth. Wireless technologies have to
        be used to tackle this enormous need for a worldwide digital
        aeronautical data link infrastructure.

        <name>Requirements for RAW</name>
        <t>Different safety levels need to be supported. All network traffic
        handled by the Airborne Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) System are not
        equal, and the QoS requirements of each network traffic flow must be
        considered n order to avoid having to support QoS requirements at the
        granularity of data flows. These flows are grouped into classes that
        have similar requirements, following the Diffserv approach <xref
        target="ARINC858P1" format="default"/>. These classes are referred to
        as Classes of Service (CoS), and the flows within a class are treated
        uniformly from a QoS perspective. Currently, there are at least eight
        different priority levels (CoS) that can be assigned to packets. For
        example, a high-priority message requiring low latency and high
        resiliency could be a "WAKE" warning indicating two aircraft are
        dangerously close to each other, while a less safety-critical message
        with low-to-medium latency requirements could be the "WXGRAPH" service
        providing graphical weather data.
        </t>
        <t>Overhead needs to be kept to a minimum since aeronautical data
        links provide comparatively small data rates on the order of kbit/s.
        </t>
        <t>Policy needs to be supported when selecting data links. The focus
        of RAW here should be on the selectors that are responsible for the
        track a packet takes to reach its end destination. This would minimize
        the amount of routing information that must travel inside the network
        because of precomputed routing tables, with the selector being
        responsible for choosing the most appropriate option according to
        policy and safety.

          <name>Non-latency-critical Considerations</name>
          <t>Achieving low latency is a requirement for aeronautics
          communications, though the expected latency is not extremely low, and
          what is important is to keep the overall latency bounded under a
          certain threshold. Low latency in LDACS communications <xref
          target="RFC9372" format="default"/> translates to a latency in the
          Forward Link (FL - Ground -&gt; Air) of 30-90 ms and a latency in
          the Reverse Link (RL - Air -&gt; Ground) of 60-120 ms. This use case
          is not latency critical from that view point. On the other hand,
          given the controlled environment, end-to-end mechanisms can be
          applied to guarantee bounded latency where needed.

          <li>Video: augmented and virtual realities are integrated in the
          attraction.  Wearable mobile devices (e.g., glasses and virtual

          tasks.</li>
          <li>Real-time interactions: visitors may interact with an

          virtually interact with their environment, triggering actions in the
          real world (through actuators) <xref target="KOB12"

          <li>Geolocation: visitors are tracked with a personal wireless tag,
          so that their user experience is improved. This requires special
          care to ensure that visitors' privacy is not breached, and users are
          anonymously tracked.</li>
          <li>Predictive maintenance: statistics are collected to predict the
          future failures or to compute later more complex statistics about
          the attraction's usage, the downtime, etc.</li>

        guarantee end-to-end requirements across heterogeneous technologies
        with strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements.
        </t>
        <t>Nowadays, long-range wireless transmissions are used mostly for
        best-effort traffic. On the contrary, <xref target="IEEE802.1AS"

        devices. However, we need an IP-enabled technology to interconnect
        large areas, independent of the Physical (PHY) and Medium Access

        <t>It is expected that several different technologies (long vs. short

        <t>It is worth noting that low-priority flows (e.g., predictive

A major use case for networking in industrial environments is the control
networks where periodic control loops operate between a collection of sensors
that measure a physical property (such as the temperature of a fluid), a
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) that decides on an action (such as "warm
up the mix"), and actuators that perform the required action (such as the
injection of power in a resistor).

          <t>Process Control designates continuous processing operations, like
          heating oil in a refinery or mixing up soda. Control loops in
          the Process Control industry operate at a very low rate, typically
          four times per second. Factory Automation, on the other hand, deals
          with discrete goods, such as individual automobile parts, and
          requires faster loops, to the rate of milliseconds.  Motion control
          that monitors dynamic activities may require even faster rates on
          the order of and below the millisecond.
          </t>
          <t>In all those cases, a packet must flow reliably between the
          sensor and the PLC, be processed by the PLC, and be sent to the
          actuator within the control loop period. In some particular use
          cases that inherit from analog operations, jitter might also alter
          the operation of the control loop. A rare packet loss is usually
          admissible, but typically, a loss of multiple packets in a row will
          cause an emergency halt of the production and incur a high cost for
          the manufacturer.

          <t>A secondary use case deals with monitoring and diagnostics. This
          data is essential to improve the performance of a production line,
          e.g., by optimizing real-time processing or by maintenance windows
          using Machine Learning predictions. For the lack of wireless
          technologies, some specific industries such as Oil and Gas have been
          using serial cables, literally by the millions, to perform their
          process optimization over the previous decades. However, few
          industries would afford the associated cost. One of the goals of the
          Industrial Internet of Things is to provide the same benefits to all
          industries, including SmartGrid, transportation, building,
          commercial, and medical. This requires a cheap, available, and

          <t>Inside the factory, wires may already be available to operate the

          rich and asynchronous, meaning that it may influence the
          deterministic nature of the control operations and impact the
          production. On the other hand, this information must be reported to
          the operators over IP, which means the potential for a security
          breach via the interconnection of the Operational Technology

        <t>Wires used on a robot arm are prone to breakage, after a few
        thousand flexions, a lot faster than a power cable that is wider in
        diameter and more resilient. In general, wired networking and mobile
        parts are not a good match, mostly in the case of fast and recurrent
        activities, as well as rotation.
        </t>
        <t>When refurbishing older premises that were built before the
        Internet age, power is usually available everywhere, but data is
        not. It is often impractical, time consuming and expensive to deploy
        an Ethernet fabric across walls and between buildings. Deploying a
        wire may take months and cost tens of thousands of US Dollars.
        </t>
        <t>Even when wiring exists, like in the case of an existing control
        network, asynchronous IP packets, such as diagnostics, may not be
        welcome for operational and security reasons. For those packets, the
        option to create a parallel wireless network offers a credible
        solution that can scale with the many sensors and actuators that equip
        every robot, valve, and fan that are deployed on the factory floor. It
        may also help detect and prevent a failure that could impact the
        production, like the degradation (vibration) of a cooling fan on the
        ceiling. IEEE Std. 802.15.4 TSCH <xref target="RFC7554"

        format="default">"6TiSCH Architecture"</xref> serves that requirement,
        the work at 6TiSCH was focused on best-effort IPv6 packet flows. RAW
        should be able to lock so-called "hard cells" (i.e., scheduled cells
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology" format="default"/>) for use
        by a centralized scheduler and leverage time and spatial diversity

        <t>Over recent years, major industrial protocols
        have been migrating towards Ethernet and IP. (For example, <xref target="ODVA"/> with

        supports network technologies built on the Common Industrial Protocol

        application over any network that has the physical capacity to
        transport the industrial flow, regardless of the MAC/PHY technology,
        wired, or wireless, and across technologies. RAW mechanisms should be
        able to set up a Track over a wireless access segment and a wired or
        wireless backbone to report both sensor data and critical monitoring
        within a bounded latency and should be able to maintain the high
        reliability of the flows over time. It is also important to ensure
        that RAW solutions are interoperable with existing wireless solutions
        in place and with legacy equipment whose capabilities can be extended

        <t>Gaming is evolving towards wireless, as players demand being able
        to play anywhere, and the game requires a more immersive experience
        including body movements. Besides, the industry is changing towards
        playing from mobile phones, which are inherently connected via
        wireless technologies.
Wireless controllers are the rule in modern gaming, with increasingly
sophisticated interactions (e.g., haptic feedback, augmented reality).

          interconnect different users, the communication requirements of this
          use case might be considered as latency critical due to the need of

          part of the communication path is not wireless, and DetNet
          mechanisms cannot be applied easily (e.g., when the public Internet

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Use Case Description</name>
        <t>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular for many
        different applications, including military and civil use cases. The
        term "drone" is commonly used to refer to a UAV.
        </t>
        <t>
UAVs can be used to perform aerial surveillance activities, traffic monitoring
(i.e., the Spanish traffic control has recently introduced a fleet of drones
for quicker reactions upon traffic congestion related events <xref
target="DGT2021" format="default"/>), support of emergency situations, and
even transporting of small goods (e.g., medicine in rural areas). Note that
the surveillance and monitoring application would have to comply with local
regulations regarding location privacy of users. Different considerations have
to be applied when surveillance is performed for traffic rules enforcement
(e.g., generating fines), as compared to when traffic load is being monitored.
        </t>
        <t>Many types of vehicles, including UAVs but also others, such as
        cars, can travel in platoons, driving together with shorter distances
        between vehicles to increase efficiency. Platooning imposes certain
        vehicle-to-vehicle considerations, most of these are applicable to
        both UAVs and other vehicle types.</t>
        <t>UAVs and other vehicles typically have various forms of wireless
        connectivity:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Cellular: for communication with the control center, remote
          maneuvering, and monitoring of the drone;</li>
          <li>IEEE 802.11: for inter-drone communications (i.e., platooning)
          and providing connectivity to other devices (i.e., acting as Access
          Point).</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Note that autonomous cars share many of the characteristics of the
        aforementioned UAV case. Therefore, it is of interest for RAW.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Specifics</name>
        <t>Some of the use cases and tasks involving UAVs require coordination
        among UAVs.  Others involve complex computing tasks that might not be
        performed using the limited computing resources that a drone typically
        has. These two aspects require continuous connectivity with the
        control center and among UAVs.
        </t>
        <t>Remote maneuvering of a drone might be performed over a cellular
        network in some cases, but there are situations that need very
        low latency and deterministic behavior of the connectivity. Examples
        involve platooning of drones or sharing of computing resources among
        drones (like a drone offloading some function to a neighboring drone).

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Use Case Description</name>
        <t>The edge robotics scenario consists of several robots, deployed in
        a given area (like a shopping mall) and inter-connected via an access
        network to a network edge device or a data center. The robots are
        connected to the edge so that complex computational activities are not
        executed locally at the robots but offloaded to the edge. This brings
        additional flexibility in the type of tasks that the robots perform,
        reduces the costs of robot-manufacturing (due to their lower
        complexity), and enables complex tasks involving coordination among
        robots (that can be more easily performed if robots are centrally
        controlled).
        </t>
        <t>
Simple examples of the use of multiple robots are cleaning, video surveillance
(note that this have to comply with local regulations regarding user privacy
at the application level), search and rescue operations, and delivering of
goods from warehouses to shops.  Multiple robots are simultaneously instructed
to perform individual tasks by moving the robotic intelligence from the robots
to the network's edge. That enables easy synchronization, scalable solution,
and on-demand option to create flexible fleet of robots.
