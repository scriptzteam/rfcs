      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This specification describes an interoperable regular expression (abbreviated as "regexp") flavor, I-Regexp.</t>
      <t>I-Regexp does not provide advanced regular expression features such as capture groups, lookahead, or backreferences.
It supports only a Boolean matching capability, i.e., testing whether a given regular expression matches a given piece of text.</t>
      <t>I-Regexp supports the entire repertoire of Unicode characters (Unicode
scalar values); both the I-Regexp strings themselves and the strings
they are matched against are sequences of Unicode scalar values (often
represented in UTF-8 encoding form <xref target="STD63"/> for interchange).</t>
      <t>I-Regexp is a subset of XML Schema Definition (XSD) regular expressions <xref target="XSD-2"/>.</t>
      <t>This document includes guidance for converting I-Regexps for use with several well-known regular expression idioms.</t>
      <t>The development of I-Regexp was motivated by the work of the JSONPath Working Group (WG). The WG wanted to include support for the use of regular expressions in JSONPath filters 
in its specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base"/>, but was unable to find a useful
specification for regular expressions that would be interoperable across the popular libraries.</t>
      <section anchor="terminology">
        <name>Terminology</name>
        <t>This document uses the abbreviation "regexp" for what is usually
called a "regular expression" in programming.
The term "I-Regexp" is used as a noun meaning a character string (sequence of
Unicode scalar values) that conforms to the requirements
in this specification; the plural is "I-Regexps".</t>
        <t>This specification uses Unicode terminology; a good entry point is provided by <xref target="UNICODE-GLOSSARY"/>.</t>
        <t>
    The key words "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>", "<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL
    NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>",
    "<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>", and "<bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>

<t>The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as ABNF,
as described in <xref target="RFC5234"/> and <xref target="RFC7405"/>, where the "characters" of
<xref section="2.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC5234"/> are Unicode scalar values.</t>

      <name>Objectives</name>
      <t>I-Regexps should handle the vast majority of practical cases where a
matching regexp is needed in a data-model specification or a query-language expression.</t>
      <t>At the time of writing, an editor of this document conducted a survey of the regexp syntax
used in recently published RFCs. All examples found there should be covered by I-Regexps,
both syntactically and with their intended semantics.
The exception is the use of multi-character escapes, for which
workaround guidance is provided in <xref target="mapping"/>.</t>

        <name>Checking Implementations</name>
	
        <t>A <em>checking</em> I-Regexp implementation is one that checks a supplied
regexp for compliance with this specification and reports any problems.
Checking implementations give their users confidence that they didn't
accidentally insert syntax that is not interoperable, so checking is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.
Exceptions to this rule may be made for low-effort implementations
that map I-Regexp to another regexp library by simple steps such as
performing the mapping operations discussed in <xref target="mapping"/>.  Here, the
effort needed to do full checking might dwarf the rest of the
implementation effort.
Implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> document whether or not they are checking.</t>
        <t>Specifications that employ I-Regexp may want to define in which
cases their implementations can work with a non-checking I-Regexp
implementation and when full checking is needed, possibly in the
process of defining their own implementation classes.</t>

XSD 1.1 is less widely implemented than XSD 1.0, and implementations
of XSD 1.0 are likely to include these bugfixes; for the intents

    <section anchor="background">
      <name>Motivation and Background</name>
      <t>While regular expressions originally were intended to describe a
formal language to support a Boolean matching function, they
have been enhanced with parsing functions that support the extraction
and replacement of arbitrary portions of the matched text. With this
accretion of features, parsing-regexp libraries have become
more susceptible to bugs and surprising performance degradations that
can be exploited in denial-of-service attacks by
an attacker who controls the regexp submitted for
processing. I-Regexp is designed to offer interoperability and to be
less vulnerable to such attacks, with the trade-off that its only
function is to offer a Boolean response as to whether a character
sequence is matched by a regexp.</t>
      <section anchor="subsetting">
        <name>Implementing I-Regexp</name>
        <t>XSD regexps are relatively easy to implement or map to widely
implemented parsing-regexp dialects, with these notable
exceptions:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Character class subtraction.  This is a very useful feature in
          many specifications, but it is unfortunately mostly absent from
          parsing-regexp dialects. Thus, it is omitted from I-Regexp.</li>
          <li>Multi-character escapes.  <tt>\d</tt>, <tt>\w</tt>, <tt>\s</tt>
          and their uppercase complement classes exhibit a large amount of
          variation between regexp flavors.  Thus, they are omitted from
          I-Regexp.</li>
          <li>Not all regexp implementations support access to Unicode
          tables that enable executing constructs such as <tt>\p{Nd}</tt>,
          although the <tt>\p</tt>/<tt>\P</tt> feature in general is now quite
          widely available. While, in principle, it is possible to translate
          these into character-class matches, this also requires access to
          those tables. Thus, regexp libraries in severely constrained
          environments may not be able to support I-Regexp conformance.</li>

    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>While technically out of the scope of this specification, Section <xref target="RFC3629" section="10" sectionFormat="bare"> "Security Considerations"</xref> of RFC 3629 <xref target="STD63"/> applies to implementations.
Particular note needs to be taken of the last paragraph of Section <xref target="RFC3629" section="3" sectionFormat="bare"> "UTF-8 definition" </xref> of RFC 3629 <xref target="STD63"/>; an I-Regexp implementation may need to
mitigate limitations of the platform implementation in this regard.</t>
      <t>As discussed in <xref target="background"/>, more complex regexp libraries may
contain exploitable bugs, which can lead to crashes and remote code
execution.  There is also the problem that such libraries often have
performance characteristics that are hard to predict, leading to attacks
that overload an implementation by matching against an expensive
attacker-controlled regexp.</t>
      <t>I-Regexps have been designed to allow implementation in a way that is
resilient to both threats; this objective needs to be addressed
throughout the implementation effort. Non-checking implementations (see <xref target="checking"/>) are likely to expose
security limitations of any regexp engine they use, which may be less
problematic if that engine has been built with security considerations
in mind (e.g., <xref target="RE2"/>).  In any case, a checking implementation is still <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.</t>
      <t>Implementations that specifically implement the I-Regexp subset can,
with care, be designed to generally run in linear time and space in
the input and to detect when that would not be the case (see below).</t>
      <t>Existing regexp engines should be able to easily handle most I-Regexps
(after the adjustments discussed in <xref target="mapping"/>), but may consume
excessive resources for some types of I-Regexps or outright reject
them because they cannot guarantee efficient execution.
(Note that different versions of the same regexp library may be more or
      less vulnerable to excessive resource consumption for these cases.)</t>
      
      <t>Specifically, range quantifiers (as in <tt>a{2,4}</tt>) provide particular
challenges for both existing and I-Regexp focused implementations.
Implementations may therefore limit range quantifiers in composability
(disallowing nested range quantifiers such as <tt>(a{2,4}){2,4}</tt>) or
range (disallowing very large ranges such as <tt>a{20,200000}</tt>), or detect
and reject any excessive resource consumption caused by range quantifiers.</t>
      <t>I-Regexp implementations that are used to evaluate regexps from
untrusted sources need to be robust in these cases.
Implementers using existing regexp libraries are encouraged:</t>

<ul>
  <li>to check
their documentation to see if mitigations are configurable, such as
  limits in resource consumption, and</li>
  <li>to document their own degree of
robustness resulting from employing such mitigations.</li></ul>
