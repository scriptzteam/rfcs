  <t>
    
   Intent is an abstract, high-level policy used to operate a network.
   An intent-based management system includes an interface for users to
   input requests and an engine to translate the intents into the
   network configuration and manage their life cycle.</t>
      <t>
   This document mostly discusses the concept of network intents, but
   other types of intents are also considered. Specifically, this document
   highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify
   and encode intent, and the associated intent taxonomy; it also defines
   relevant intent terms where necessary, provides a
   foundation for intent-related research, and facilitates solution
   development.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      
      <t>
   The vision of intent-based networks has attracted a lot of attention
   because it promises to simplify the management of networks by human
   operators. This is done by simply specifying what should happen on
   the network without giving any instructions on how to do it. This
   promise caused many researcher-led activities and telecom companies to
   start researching this new vision and many Standards Development
   Organizations (SDOs) to propose different intent frameworks.</t>
      <t>
   This document proposes an intent classification methodology and an
   intent taxonomy. The scope of these proposals is to ensure a common
   understanding in the research community in terms of what the
   intent users, intent types, or intent solutions, etc., are for specific
   scenarios that are being considered.</t>
      <t>
   The document represents the consensus of the Network Management
   Research Group (NMRG). It has been reviewed extensively by the
   Research Group (RG) members who are actively involved in the research
   and development of the technology covered by this document. It is not
   an IETF product and is not a standard.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-1.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Research Activities</name>
        <t>
   Intent-based networking is an active research topic spanning
   across different areas that could benefit from an intent
   classification and taxonomy.</t>

 <t>Some examples include:
 </t>

 <ul>
   <li>
     intent expression and recognition (<xref
   target="Bezahaf21" format="default"/>, <xref target="Bezahaf19"
   format="default"/>, <xref target="Jacobs18" format="default"/>).
The use of a common classification could provide consistency in the
understanding of the various forms of intent expressions being proposed and
investigated.

     
       </li>

       <li>
the orchestration of cognitive autonomous radio access networks (RANs) <xref
target="Banerjee21" format="default"/> where intents are
classified based on their content.

	 
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    intent network verification <xref target="Tian19"
	    format="default"/>, where the authors are working to propose new
	    intent language.

   </li>

 </ul>


        <t>

   Furthermore, this document is already proving to be extremely relevant to the
   research community as it has been used as the basis for proposing
   self-generated Intent-based systems <xref target="Bezahaf19"
   format="default"/>, for advancing Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement solutions based on Internet-Based Networks (IBNs) that rely on defining user intent profiles corresponding to abstract network
   services <xref target="Leivadeas21" format="default"/>, for improving
   existing solutions in provisioning intent-based networks, for proposing new
   approaches to service management <xref target="Davoli21"
   format="default"/>, and even for defining grammars for users to specify the
   high-level requirements for blockchain selection in the form of intent
   <xref target="Padovan20" format="default"/>. As well, the document has been
   mentioned in surveys addressing the topic of intelligent intent-based
   autonomous networks <xref target="Mehmood21" format="default"/> <xref
   target="Szilagyi21" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   This document also describes an example on how this proposal has been
   successfully applied in an academic environment <xref target="POC-IBN"
   format="default"/> by researchers in the area of Software-Defined Networking / Network Function Virtualization (SDN/NFV) for defining the
   scope of their project. The specific problem addressed by researchers is how
   to apply intent concepts at different levels that correspond to different
   stakeholders.</t>
        <t>
   The IEEE Communications Society Technical Committee on Network Operation and
   Management (IEEE-CNOM), IRTF Network Management Research Group, and IFIP WG6.6 have developed a taxonomy
   for network and service management <xref target="IFIP-NSM"
   format="default"/> that is used by the research community in network
   management and operations to structure the research area through a
   well-defined set of keywords and to improve quality of reviews in
   submissions to journals, conferences, and workshops. The proposed intent
   taxonomy may be contributed as an extension to this taxonomy for intent-driven management.</t>

        <name>Standards and Open-Source Activities</name>


	<t>
   Several SDOs and open-source projects, such as the IRTF NMRG, Open Networking
   Foundation (ONF) <xref target="ONF" format="default"/> / Open Network
   Operating System (ONOS) <xref target="ONOS" format="default"/>, European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) / Experiential Networked
   Intelligence (ENI), and TMF with its autonomous networks, have proposed intents
   for defining a set of network operations to execute in a declarative
   manner.</t>


   <t>
   More recently, the IRTF NMRG is working on "Intent-Based Networking -
   Concepts and Definitions" <xref target="RFC9315" format="default"/>. This document clarifies
   the concept of "Intent" and provides an overview of the functionality that
   is associated with it.  The goal is to contribute towards a common and
   shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used
   as the foundation to guide further definition of associated research and
   engineering problems and their solutions.</t>
        <t>
   The present document, together with <xref target="RFC9315" format="default"/>, aims to become the
   foundation for future intent-related topic discussions regarding the
   NMRG.</t>

   <t>
   The SDOs usually come up with their own way of specifying an intent and
   their own understanding of what an intent is.


   Additionally, each SDO defines a set of terms and level of abstraction, its intent users, and the applications and usage scenarios.

   </t>
        <t>
   However, most intent approaches proposed by SDOs share the same features:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>It must be declarative in nature, meaning that an intent user
     specifies the goal on the network without specifying how to achieve
     that goal.</li>
          <li>It must be vendor agnostic in the sense that it abstracts the
     network capabilities or the network infrastructure from the intent
     user, and it can be ported across different platforms.</li>
          <li>It must provide an easy-to-use interface, which simplifies the
     interaction of the intent users with the intent system through the usage
     of familiar terminology or concepts.</li>

     <li>
   It should be able to detect and resolve intent conflicts, which include,
   for example, static (compile-time) conflicts and dynamic (run-time)
   conflicts.
</li>
        </ul>

        <name>Scope</name>

        <t>
   The focus of this document is on the definition of criteria enabling
   the categorization of intents from viewpoint of the stakeholders.  Concepts and
   definitions related to IBN are provided in <xref target="RFC9315" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   This document mostly addresses intents in the context of network
   intents; however, other types of intents are not excluded, as
   presented in Sections <xref target="sect-4.4" format="counter"/> and <xref target="sect-6.2" format="counter"/>.</t>
        <t>
   It is impossible to fully differentiate intents only by the common
   characteristics followed by concepts, terms, and intentions. This
   document clarifies what an intent represents for different
   stakeholders through a classification on various dimensions, such as
   solutions, intent users, and intent types. This classification
   ensures common understanding among all participants and is used to
   determine the scope and priority of individual projects,
   proof of concepts (PoCs), research initiatives, or open-source projects.</t>
        <t>
   The scope of intent classification in this document includes
   solutions, intent users, and intent types; the initial
   classification table is made according to this scope. The
   methodology presented can be used to update the classification
   tables by adding or removing different solutions, intent users, or
   intent types to cater to future scenarios, applications, or domains.</t>

      <name>Abstract Intent Requirements</name>
      <t>
   In order to understand the different intent requirements that would
   drive intent classification, we first need to understand what intent
   means for different intent users.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-4.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>What is intent?</name>
        <t>
   The term "Intent" has become very widely used in the industry for different
   purposes; sometimes its use is not even in agreement with SDO-shared principles
   mentioned in <xref target="sect-1" format="default"></xref>. <xref target="RFC9315"
   format="default"/> brings clarification with relation to what an intent is
   and how it differentiates from policies and services.</t>
        <t>
   Different stakeholders have different perspectives of the network;
   therefore, they have different intent requirements. Their intent is sometimes
   technical, non-technical, abstract, or technology specific.  Therefore, it
   is important to start a discussion in the industry and academic communities
   about what intent is for different solutions and intent users. It is also
   imperative to try to propose some intent categories/classifications that
   could be understood by a wider audience. This would help us define intent
   interfaces, domain-specific languages, and models.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-4.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intent Solutions and Intent Users</name>
        <t>
   Intent types are defined by all aspects that are required to profile
   different requirements to easily distinguish between them. However, in order
   to facilitate a clustered classification, we can focus on two aspects: the
   solution and intent user. They can be considered to be the main keys to
   classify intents, as we can easily group requirements by solution and intent
   user.</t>
        <t>
   On the one hand, different solutions and intent users have different
   requirements, expectations, and priorities for intent-based
   networking. Therefore, intent users require different intent types,
   depending on their context, since they participate in different use
   cases. For instance, some intent users are more technical and require
   intents that expose more technical information. Other intent users do not
   have knowledge of the network infrastructure and require intents that shield
   them from different networking concepts and technologies.</t>
        <t>
   The following are the solutions and intent users that intent-based
   networking needs to support:</t>
        <table anchor="tab-intent-solutions-and-intent-users" align="center">
          <name>Intent Solutions and Intent Users</name>
          <thead>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <t>
   These intent solutions and intent users represent a starting point
   for the classification and are expendable through the methodology
   presented in <xref target="sect-6.1"/>.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">

	  <li>For carrier network scenarios, for example, if a
     customer/subscriber wants to watch high-definition video, then the
     intent is to convert the video image to 1080p.</li>
          <li>For DC network scenarios, administrators have their own clear
     network intent such as load balancing. For all traffic flows that
     need NFV service chaining, they can restrict the maximum load of any VNF
     node / container below 50% and the maximum load of any network link
     below 70%.</li>
          <li>For enterprise network scenarios, when hosting a video conference,
     multiple remote accesses are required. An example of the intent
     from the network administrator is as follows: for any end user of this
     application, the arrival time of hologram objects of all the
     remote tele-presenters should be synchronized within 50 ms to reach
     the destination viewer for each conversation session.</li>
        </ul>

      <section anchor="sect-4.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Benefits of Intents for Different Stakeholders</name>
        <t>
   Current network APIs and CLIs are too complex because they are highly
   integrated with the low-level concepts exposed by networks.


 Customers, application developers, and end users must not be required to set
 IP addresses, VLANs, subnets, or ports, whereas operators may still want to
 have both more technical and network visibility.


	All stakeholders would benefit from simpler interfaces, such as:</t>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>request gold VPN service between sites A, B, and C</li>
          <li>provide CE redundancy for the customer sites</li>
          <li>add access rules to the network service</li>
        </ul>
        <t>

   Operators and administrators manually troubleshoot and fix their networks
   and services. They instead want to:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>simplify and automate network operations</li>
          <li>simplify definitions of network services</li>
          <li>provide simple customer APIs for value-added services (operators)</li>
          <li>be informed if the network or service is not behaving as requested</li>
          <li>enable automatic optimization and correction for selected scenarios</li>
          <li>have systems that learn from historic information and behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   Currently, intent users cannot build their own services and policies
   without becoming technical experts and performing manual maintenance
   actions. They instead want to be able to:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>build their own network services with their own policies via
      simple interfaces, without becoming networking experts</li>
          <li>have their network services up and running based on intent and
      automation only, without any manual actions or maintenance</li>
        </ul>

      <section anchor="sect-4.4" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intent Types That Need to Be Supported</name>
        <t>
   Next to the intent solutions and intent users, another way to
   categorize the intent is through the intent types. The following
   intent types and subtypes need to be supported in order to address
   the requirements from different solutions and intent users.</t>

   It is important to mention all of the previously mentioned types and
   subtypes may affect other intents. For example, operational task intent can
   modify many other intents. The task itself is short lived, but the
   modification of other intents has an impact on their life cycle, so those
   changes must continue to be continuously monitored and
   self corrected/optimized.</t>

      <name>Functional Characteristics and Behavior</name>
      <t>
   Intent can be used to operate immediately on a target (much like
   issuing a command) or whenever it is appropriate (e.g., in response
   to an event). In either case, intent has a number of behaviors that
   serve to further organize its purpose, as described by the following
   subsections.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-5.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Abstracting Intent Operation</name>
        <t>
   The modeling of intents can be abstracted using the following three-tuple:</t>
        <t>{Context, Capabilities, Constraints}</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Context grounds the intent and determines if it is relevant or
     not for the current situation. Thus, context selects intents based
     on applicability.</li>
          <li>Capabilities describe the functionality that the intent can
     perform.  Capabilities take different forms depending on the
     expressivity of the intent as well as the programming paradigm(s)
     used.</li>
          <li>Constraints define any restrictions on the capabilities to be used
     for that particular context.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   Metadata can be attached via strategy templates to each of the
   elements of the three-tuple and may be used to describe how the
   intent should be used and how it operates as well as prescribe any
   operational dependencies that must be taken into account.</t>
        <t>
   Although different intent categories share the same abstracted intent
   model, each category will have its own specific context, capabilities,
   and constraints.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-5.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intent User Types</name>
        <t>
   Expanding on the introduction in <xref target="sect-4.2"/>, intent user
   types represent the intent users that define and issue the intent request.
   Depending on the intent solutions, there are specific intent users.
   Examples of intent users are customers, network operators, service
   operators, enterprise administrators, cloud administrators, underlay
   network administrators, or application developers.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Customers and end users do not necessarily know the functional and
     operational details of the network that they are using.
     Furthermore, they lack skills to understand such details; in fact,
     such knowledge is typically not relevant to their job. In
     addition, the network may not expose these details to its intent
     users. This class of intent users focuses on the applications that
     they run and uses services offered by the network.  Hence, they
     want to specify policies that provide consistent behavior
     according to their business needs. They do not have to worry about
     how the intents are deployed onto the underlying network and
     especially whether the intents need to be translated to different
     forms to enable network elements to understand them.</li>
          <li>Application developers work in a set of abstractions defined by
     their application and programming environment(s). For example,
     many application developers think in terms of objects (e.g., a
     VPN).  While this makes sense to the application developer, most
     network devices do not have a VPN object per se; rather, the VPN
     is formed through a set of configuration statements for that
     device in concert with configuration statements for the other
     devices that together make up the VPN. Hence, the view of
     application developers matches the services provided by the
     network but may not directly correspond to other views of other
     intent users.</li>
          <li>Network operators may have the knowledge of the underlying
     network. However, they may not understand the details of the
     applications and services of customers.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-5.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intent Scope</name>
        <t>
   Intents are used to manage the behavior of the networks they are
   applied to and all intents are applied within a specific scope, such
   as:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>connectivity scope, if the intent creates or modifies a connection</li>
          <li>security/privacy scope, if the intent specifies the security
     characteristics of the network, customers, or end users</li>
          <li>application scope, when the intent specifies the applications to
     be affected by the intent request</li>
          <li>QoS scope, when the intent specifies the QoS characteristics of
     the network</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   These intent scopes are expendable through the methodology presented
   in <xref target="sect-6.1"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-5.4" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intent Network Scope</name>
        <t>
   Regardless of the intent user type, their intent request affects
   the network, or network components, which are representing the intent
   targets.</t>
        <t>
   Thus, the intent network scope, or policy target as known in the area of
   declarative policy, can represent VNFs or PNFs, physical network
   elements, campus networks, SD-WANs, RANs,
   cloud edges, cloud cores, branches, etc.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-5.5" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intent Abstraction</name>
        <t>
   Intent can be classified by whether it is necessary to feed back
   technical network information or non-technical information to the
   intent user after the intent is executed. As well, intent abstraction
   covers the level of technical details in the intent itself.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Non-technical intent users do not care how the intent is
     executed nor do they care about the details of the network. As a result, they do not
     need to know the configuration information of the underlying
     network. They only focus on whether the intent execution result
     achieves the goal and the execution effect such as the quality of
     completion and the length of execution. In this scenario, we refer
     to an abstraction without technical feedback.</li>
          <li>Administrators, such as network administrators, perform
     intents, such as allocating network resources, selecting
     transmission paths, handling network failures, etc. They require
     multiple feedback indicators for network resource conditions,
     congestion conditions, fault conditions, etc., after execution. In
     this case, we refer to an abstraction with technical feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   As per the definition of "intent" provided in <xref target="RFC9315" format="default"/>, lower-level intents are not
   considered to qualify as intents. However, we kept this classification to
   identify any PoCs / Demos / Use Cases that still either require or implement
   a lower level of abstraction for intents.</t>

   on the Autonomous Network Level of the overall solution, we may have
   different intent requirements and types. For example, at lower levels, the

   <ul spacing="normal">
     <li>automatically converted to configuration policies only

      <name>Intent Classification</name>
      <t>
   This section proposes an approach to intent classification that may help
   to classify mainstream intent-related demos/tools.</t>
      <t>
   The three classifications in this document have been proposed from
   scratch (following the methodology presented) through three
   iterations: one for a carrier network intent solution, one for a DC
   intent solution, and one for an enterprise intent solution. For each
   intent solution, we identified the specific intent users and intent
   types.  Then, we further identified intent scope, network scope,
   abstractions, and life-cycle requirements.</t>
      <t>
   These classifications and the generated tables can be easily
   extended.

   For example, for the DC intent solution, a new category "resource scope" is
   identified, and the classification table has
   been extended accordingly.</t>
      <t>
   In the future, as new scenarios, applications, and domains emerge, new classifications and taxonomies can be identified,
   following the proposed methodology.</t>
      <t>
   The intent classifications have been documented to the best of our
   knowledge at the time of writing. Additional classifications will most
   likely come to light in the future.</t>
      <t>
   The output of the intent classification is the intent taxonomy
   introduced in the subsections of this section.</t>
   <t>
   Thus,  the subsections of <xref target="sect-6" format="default"/> introduce the proposed intent
   classification methodology, the consolidated intent taxonomy
   for three intent solutions, and the concrete examples of intent
   classifications for three different intent solutions (e.g., carrier
   network, data center, and enterprise) that were derived using the
   proposed methodology and can be filled in for PoCs, demos,
   research projects, or future documents.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-6.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intent Classification Methodology</name>
        <t>
   This section describes the methodology used to derive the initial
   classification proposed in the document. The proposed methodology can be
   used to create new intent classifications from scratch by analyzing
   the solution knowledge. As well, the methodology can be used to
   update existing classification tables by adding or removing different
   solutions, intent users, or intent types in order to cater to future
   scenarios, applications, or domains.</t>

   The intent classification workflow starts from the solution
   knowledge, which can provide information on requirements, use cases,
   technologies used, network properties, intent users that define and
   issue the intent request, and requirements. The following defines
   the steps to classify an intent:

        </t>

        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
   Receive the information provided in the solution knowledge as
   input for identifying the intent solution (e.g., carrier, enterprise,
   and data center). Intent solutions are reviewed against the existing
   classification and can either be used if present or added if not
   there; if not needed, they can be removed from the classification (R1-U1).</li>
          <li>
   Identify the intent user types (e.g., customer, network operators, service
   operators, etc.).  Review the existing intent classification. Then use the intent
   user type if present; add it if it is not there or remove it if not needed
   (R2-U2).</li>
          <li>
   Identify the types of intent (e.g., network intent, customer
   service intent).  Review the existing classification and
   then use, add, or remove the intent type (R3-U3).</li>
          <li>
   Identify the intent scopes (e.g., connectivity, application) based
   on the solution knowledge.  Then, review the existing classification.
   Use, add, or remove the identified intent scope (R4-U4).</li>
          <li>
   Identify the network scopes (e.g., campus, radio access).  Then,
   review the existing classification.  Either use, add, or remove the
   identified network scope (R5-U5).</li>
          <li>
   Identify the abstractions (e.g., technical, non-technical).
   Then, review the existing classification and either use, add, or remove the
   abstractions (R6-U6).</li>
          <li>
   Identify the life-cycle requirements (e.g., persistent, transient).
   Then, review the existing classification.  Either use, add, or remove the
   life-cycle requirements (R7-U7).</li>
   <li>
     
Identify any new categories. Use and add the newly identified categories. New
categories can be identified as new domains or applications emerge or as new
areas of concern (e.g., privacy, compliance) arise that are not listed in the
current methodology.</li>

        <section anchor="sect-6.3.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Intent Classification Example</name>

          <t>
	    This section contains an example of how the methodology described in
   <xref target="sect-6.1"/> can be used in order to classify intents introduced in the "A
   Multi-Level Approach to IBN" PoC demonstration <xref target="POC-IBN"
   format="default"/>. This PoC is led by academics carrying out research in the
   area of SDN/NFV, and the specific problem they are addressing is the application of
   the intent concept at different levels that correspond to different
   stakeholders. For this research work, they considered two types of intents:
   slice intents and service chain intents.</t>
   <t>
     
   In this PoC <xref target="POC-IBN" format="default"/>, a slice intent
   expresses a request for a network slice with two types of components: a set
   of top-layer virtual functions and a set of virtual switches and/or
   routers of L2/L3 VNFs. A service chain intent expresses a request for a
   service operated through a chain of service components running in L4-L7
   virtual functions.</t>
          <t>
   Following the intent classification methodology described
   step by step in <xref target="sect-6.1"/>, the following can be derived:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>The intent solution for both intents is carrier network.</li>
            <li>The intent user type is network operator for the slice intent and
     service operator for the service chain intent.</li>
            <li>The type of intent is a network service intent for the slice
     intent and a customer service intent for the service chain intent.</li>
            <li>The intent scopes are connectivity and application.</li>
            <li>The network scope is VNF, cloud edge, and cloud core.</li>
            <li>The abstractions are with technical feedback for the slice intent
     and without technical feedback for the service chain intent.</li>
            <li>The life cycle is persistent.</li>
          </ol>
          <t>
   The following table shows how to represent this information in a
   tabular form. The "X" in the table refers to the slice intent;
   the "Y" in the table refers to the service chain intent. </t>

          <name>Intent Classification Example</name>
          <t>
   This section depicts an example on how the methodology described in <xref target="sect-6.1"/>
   can be used by the research community to classify intents. As
   mentioned in <xref target="sect-6.3.3"/>, a successful use of the classification proposed in this
   document is introduced in the PoC demonstration titled "A Multi-Level Approach to IBN" <xref target="POC-IBN" format="default"/>. The PoC is led by
   academics carrying out research in the area of SDN/NFV; the specific problem
   they are addressing is the application of the intent concept at different levels that
   correspond to different stakeholders.</t>
          <t>
   For their research work, they considered two types of intents: slice
   intents and service chain intents. For the data center solution, only
   the slice intent is relevant.</t>
          <t>
   As already mentioned in <xref target="sect-6.3.3"/>, a slice intent expresses a
   request for a network slice with two types of components: a set of
   top-layer virtual functions and a set of virtual switches and/or
   routers of L2/L3 VNFs.</t>
          <t>
   Following the intent classification methodology described
   step by step in <xref target="sect-6.1"/>, we identify the following:</t>

   <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>The intent solution is data center.</li>
            <li>The intent user type is the cloud administrator for the slice
     intent and service chain intent.</li>
            <li>The type of intent is a cloud management intent for the slice
     intent.</li>
            <li>The intent scopes are connectivity and application.</li>
            <li>The network scope is logical; the resource scope is virtual.</li>
            <li>The abstractions are with technical feedback for the slice intent.</li>
            <li>The life cycle is persistent.</li>
          </ol>
          <t>
   The following table shows how to represent this information in a
   tabular form; the "X" in the table refers to the slice intent.</t>

      <name>Conclusions</name>
      <t>
   This document is aligned with the RG objectives and supports
   investigations into intent-based networking by proposing an intent
   categorization methodology and taxonomy. It brings clarification to
   what an intent represents for different stakeholders through the
   proposal of an intent classification approach, ensuring that a
   common understanding among all the participants exists. This,
   together with the proposed intent taxonomy provides a solid
   foundation for future intent-related discussions within the NMRG.</t>
      <t>
   The benefits of this intent classification document in the research community
   have been demonstrated through a PoC implementation <xref target="POC-IBN"
   format="default"/> in which the document's concepts have been applied at different levels
   corresponding to different stakeholders.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sect-8" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
   This document identifies security and privacy as categories of
   the intent scope. The intents could be solely security intents and
   privacy intents, or security can be embedded in the intents that
   include also connectivity, application, and QoS scope.</t>
      <t>
   Security and privacy scope is when the intent specifies the security
   characteristics of the network, customers, or end users, and privacy
   for customers and end users.</t>
   <t>
     
   More details of these security intents will be described in future
   documents that specify architecture, functionality, user intents, and
   models. An analysis of the security considerations of the
   overall intent-based system is provided in <xref target="RFC9315" sectionFormat="of" section="9"  format="default"/>.</t>
