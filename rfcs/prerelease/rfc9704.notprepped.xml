    <abstract>
      <t>When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domain names can
      be resolved authoritatively by a network-provided DNS resolver. DNS clients
      that are not configured to use this resolver by default can use it for
      these specific domains only. This specification defines a mechanism for domain owners
      to inform DNS clients about local resolvers that are authorized to answer
      authoritatively for certain subdomains.</t>

    <section anchor="intro">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>To resolve a DNS query, there are three main behaviors that an
      implementation can apply: (1) answer from a local database, (2) query
      the relevant authorities and their parents, or (3) ask a server to query
      those authorities and return the final answer. Implementations that use
      these behaviors are called "authoritative nameservers", "full/recursive
      resolvers", and "forwarders" (or "stub resolvers"), respectively. However, an
      implementation can also implement a mixture of these behaviors,
      depending on local policy, for each query. Such an implementation
      is termed a "hybrid resolver".</t>
      <t>Most DNS resolvers are hybrids of some kind. For example, stub
      resolvers support a local "hosts file" that preempts query
      forwarding, and most DNS forwarders and full resolvers can also serve
      responses from a local zone file. Other standardized hybrid resolution
      behaviors include <xref target="RFC8806">using a local root</xref>, <xref
      target="RFC6762">Multicast DNS (mDNS)</xref>, and <xref target="RFC7686">NXDOMAIN
      synthesis for .onion</xref>.</t>
      <t>Networks usually offer clients a DNS resolver using means such as
      DHCP offers or IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs). Although this resolver is
      formally specified as a recursive resolver (e.g., see <xref section="5.1"
      target="RFC8106"/>), some networks provide a hybrid resolver
      instead. If this resolver acts as an authoritative server for some names
      and -- depending on the source of the query -- provides different answers for those domains, the network is said to be using "split-horizon DNS", because those
      names resolve in this way only from inside the network.</t>
      <t>DNS clients that use pure stub resolution, sending all queries to
      the network-provided resolver, will always receive the split-horizon
      results. Conversely, clients that send all queries to a different
      resolver or implement pure full resolution locally will never receive
      them. Clients that strictly implement either of these resolution behaviors are out of scope for
      this specification. Instead, this specification enables hybrid clients
      to access split-horizon results from a network-provided hybrid resolver,
      while using a different resolution method for some or all other
      names.</t>
      <t>There are several existing mechanisms for a network to provide
      clients with "local domain hints", listing domain names that are given
      special treatment in this network (e.g., <xref target="RFC6731">
      "Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) selection"</xref>, <xref target="RFC5986">
      "access network domain name"</xref>, and "Client Fully Qualified Domain Name
 (FQDN)" <xref
      target="RFC4702"/> <xref target="RFC4704"/> in DHCP; "dnsZones" in
      Provisioning Domains (PvDs) <xref target="RFC8801"/>; and <xref
      target="RFC8598">"INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN"</xref> in Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)).
      However, none of the local domain hint mechanisms enable clients to
      determine whether this special treatment is authorized by the domain
      owner. Instead, these specifications require clients to make their own
      determinations about whether to trust and rely on these hints.</t>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism between domain names, networks,
      and clients that allows the network to establish its authority over a
      domain to a client (<xref target="establishing"/>). Clients can
      use this protocol to confirm that a local domain hint was authorized by
      the domain owner (<xref target="validating"/>), which might influence
      its processing of that hint.  This process requires cooperation between
      the local DNS zone and the public zone.</t>
      <t>In this specification, network operators securely identify the local DNS
      servers, and clients check each local domain hint against a globally
      valid parent zone.</t>

      <t>The protocol is applicable to any type of network offering

      scope of this document and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be validated using the mechanism described in this document. </t>
      <t>The use of this specification is limited to DNS servers that support authenticated encryption and
      split-horizon DNS names that are rooted in the global DNS.</t>

      <t>A participating network <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> offer one or more

      Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) <xref target="RFC9463"/>,
      Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) <xref target="RFC9462"/>, or an
      equivalent mechanism (see <xref target="vpn"/>).</t>
      <t>To establish local authority, the network <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> convey one or more
      "authorization claims" to the client.  An authorization claim is an
      abstract structure comprising:</t>
      <ul>
        <li>An Authentication Domain Name (ADN) of a local encrypted resolver.</li>
        <li>The DNS name of the authorizing parent zone.</li>
        <li>A set of subdomains of this parent zone that are claimed by
            the named local resolver (potentially including the entire parent
            zone). To claim the entire parent zone, the claimed subdomain
            will be represented as an asterisk symbol ("*").</li>
        <li>A ZONEMD Hash Algorithm (<xref section="5.3" target="RFC8976"/>).
           For interoperability purposes, implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the

           <xref section="2.2.3" target="RFC8976"/>. </li>
        <li>A high-entropy salt, up to 255 octets.</li>

      <t>If the local encrypted resolver is identified by name (e.g., using DNR), that
      identifying name <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the name used in any corresponding authorization
      claim.  Otherwise (e.g., DDR using IP addresses), the resolver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      present a validatable certificate containing a subjectAltName that
      matches the authorization claim using the validation techniques for
      matching as described in <xref target="RFC9525"/>.</t>
      <t>The network then provides each authorization claim to the parent zone operator.
      If the contents are approved, the parent zone operator computes a "Verification Token"
      according to the following procedure:</t>
      <ol>
        <li>Convert all subdomains into canonical form and sort them in canonical

        <li>Let $TOKEN = hash(len($SALT) || $SALT || $X), where "||" denotes concatenation and hash is the ZONEMD Hash Algorithm.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>The zone operator then publishes a "Verification Record" with the

<ul>
        <li>Type = TXT</li>
        <li>Owner Name = Concatenation of the ADN, "_splitdns-challenge", and
            the parent zone name</li>
        <li>Contents = "key/value" pairs, e.g., "token=base64url($TOKEN)" (without padding)</li>
      </ul>
      <t>By publishing this record, the parent zone authorizes the local
      encrypted resolver to serve these subdomains authoritatively.</t>
      <section>
        <name>Example</name>
        <t>Consider the following authorization claim:</t>

      If the resolution produces an RRset containing the expected token for this

        of the network over an encrypted transport.  That resolution strategy is
        considered tamperproof because any actor who could modify the
        response could already modify all of the user's other DNS responses.
        If the client cannot obtain a response from the external resolver within a

        <t>To ensure that this assumption holds, clients <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
        relax the acceptance rules they would otherwise apply when using this
        resolver. For example, if the client would check the Authenticated Data (AD)
        bit or validate RRSIGs locally when using this resolver, it must also do so
        when resolving TXT records for this purpose. The client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>

      <name>Operational Efficiency in Split-Horizon Deployments</name>
        <t>In many split-horizon deployments, all non-public domain names are
        placed in a separate child zone (e.g., <tt>internal.example.com</tt>).
        In this configuration, the message flow is similar to the flow described in <xref
        target="example-verify-external"/>, except that queries for hosts not within the
        subdomain (e.g., <tt>www.example.com</tt>) are sent to the
        external resolver rather than the resolver for <tt>internal.example.com</tt>.</t>
        <t>As specified in <xref target="example-verify-external"/>, the internal DNS
        server will need a certificate signed by a Certification Authority (CA) trusted by the
        client.</t>
        <t>Although placing internal domains inside a child domain is not necessary to prevent leakage,
        such placement reduces the frequency of changes to the Verification Record. This document
        recommends that the internal domains be kept in a child zone of the local domain hints
        advertised by the network. For example, if the PvD "dnsZones" entry is
        "internal.example.com" and the network-provided DNS resolver is "ns1.internal.example.com",
        the network operator can structure the internal domain names as
        "private1.internal.example.com", "private2.internal.example.com",
        etc. The network-designated resolver will be used to resolve the subdomains of
        the local domain hint "*.internal.example.com".</t>

      <t>When the endpoint is using a VPN tunnel and the tunnel is IPsec, the encrypted DNS resolver hosted by

      using the ENCDNS_IP* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
      defined in <xref target="RFC9464"/>. The VPN client
      can use the mechanism defined in <xref target="validating"/> to validate that the discovered
      encrypted DNS resolver is authorized to answer for the claimed subdomains.</t>

      <name>Authorization Claim Update</name>
      <t>A Verification Record is only valid until it expires. Expiry occurs when the Time To Live (TTL)

      fetch the Verification Records again and repeat the verification procedure. This ensures the
      availability of updated and valid Verification Records.</t>
      <t>A new Verification Record must be added to the RRset before the corresponding authorization
      claim is updated.  After the claim is updated, the following procedures can be used:</t>
      <ol>
        <li>DHCP reconfiguration can be initiated by a DHCP server that has previously communicated with a DHCP client and
   negotiated for the DHCP client to listen for Reconfigure messages, to prompt the DHCP client to
        dynamically request the updated authorization claim. This process avoids the need for
        the client to wait for its current lease to complete and request a new one, enabling the lease
        renewal to be driven by the DHCP server.</li>
        <li>The sequence number in the RA PvD Option
        can be incremented, requiring clients to fetch PvD Additional Information from the HTTPS
        server due to the updated sequence number in the new RA (<xref target="RFC8801" section="4.1"
        sectionFormat="of"/>).</li>

    <section anchor="Security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The ADNs of authorized local encrypted resolvers are
      revealed in the owner names of Verification Records.  This makes it easier for
      domain owners to understand which resolvers they are currently authorizing to
      implement split DNS. However, this could create a confidentiality issue if the
      local encrypted resolver's name contains sensitive information or is part of a
      secret subdomain. To mitigate the impact of such leakage, local resolvers should
      be given names that do not reveal any sensitive information.</t>

      (see <xref target="RFC7696"/>) is achieved by providing implementations with
      the flexibility to choose hashing algorithms from the "ZONEMD Hash Algorithms" registry
      (<xref target="RFC8976" section="5.3" sectionFormat="of"/>).</t>
      <t>The entropy of a salt depends on a high-quality pseudorandom number generator.
      For further discussion on random number generation, see <xref target="RFC4086"/>.
      The salt <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be regenerated whenever the authorization claim is updated.</t>

        <t>The keys defined in this document are mandatory. Any new assignments of keys will be considered
        as optional for the purpose of the mechanism described in this document.</t>
        <t>New assignments in the "PvD Split DNS Claims" registry will be
        administered by IANA through Expert Review <xref target="RFC8126"/>. Experts are
        requested to ensure that defined keys do not overlap in names or semantics.</t>
        <section>
          <name>Guidelines for the Designated Experts</name>
          <t>It is suggested that multiple designated experts be appointed for
          registry change requests.</t>

          <t>Criteria that should be applied by the designated experts include
          determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
          entries and whether the registration description is clear and fits
          the purpose of this registry.</t>

          <t>Registration requests are evaluated within a three-week review period
          on the advice of one or more designated experts. Within the review
          period, the designated experts will either approve or deny the
          registration request, communicating this decision to IANA. Denials
          should include an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to
          how to make the request successful.</t>
