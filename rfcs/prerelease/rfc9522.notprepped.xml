      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document describes the principles of Internet traffic
      engineering (TE).  The objective of the document is to articulate the
      general issues and principles for Internet TE and, where appropriate, to
      provide recommendations, guidelines, and options for the development of
      preplanned (offline) and dynamic (online) Internet TE capabilities and
      support systems.</t>
      <t>Even though Internet TE is most effective when applied end-to-end,
      the focus of this document is TE within a given domain (such as an
      Autonomous System (AS)).  However, because a preponderance of Internet
      traffic tends to originate in one AS and terminate in
      another, this document also provides an overview of aspects pertaining
      to inter-domain TE.</t>
      <t>This document provides terminology and a taxonomy for describing and
     understanding common Internet TE concepts.</t>
      <t>This work was first published as <xref target="RFC3272"
      format="default"/> in May 2002.  This document obsoletes <xref
      target="RFC3272" format="default"/> by making a complete update to bring
      the text in line with best current practices for Internet TE and to
      include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF.  It is worth
      noting around three-fifths of the RFCs referenced in this document
      postdate the publication of <xref target="RFC3272" format="default"/>.
      <xref target="CHANGES" format="default"/> provides a summary of changes
      between <xref target="RFC3272" format="default"/> and this document.</t>
      <section anchor="WHATTE" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>What is Internet Traffic Engineering?</name>
        <t>One of the most significant functions performed in the Internet is
        the routing and forwarding of traffic from ingress nodes to egress
        nodes.  Therefore, one of the most distinctive functions performed by
        Internet traffic engineering is the control and optimization of these
        routing and forwarding functions, to steer traffic through the
        network.</t>
        <t>Internet traffic engineering is defined as that aspect of Internet
        network engineering dealing with the issues of performance evaluation
        and performance optimization of operational IP networks.  Traffic
        engineering encompasses the application of technology and scientific
        principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and control
        of Internet traffic <xref target="RFC2702" format="default"/> <xref
        target="AWD2" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>It is the performance of the network as seen by end users of
        network services that is paramount.  The characteristics visible to
        end users are the emergent properties of the network, which are the
        characteristics of the network when viewed as a whole.  A central goal
        of the service provider, therefore, is to enhance the emergent
        properties of the network while taking economic considerations into
        account.  This is accomplished by addressing traffic-oriented
        performance requirements while utilizing network resources without
        excessive waste and in a reliable way.  Traffic-oriented performance
        measures include delay, delay variation, packet loss, and
        throughput.</t>
        <t>Internet TE responds to network events (such as link or node
        failures, reported or predicted network congestion, planned
        maintenance, service degradation, planned changes in the traffic
        matrix, etc.).  Aspects of capacity management respond at intervals
        ranging from days to years.  Routing control functions operate at
        intervals ranging from milliseconds to days.  Packet-level processing
        functions operate at very fine levels of temporal resolution (up to
        milliseconds) while reacting to statistical measures of the real-time
        behavior of traffic.</t>
        <t>Thus, the optimization aspects of TE can be viewed from a control
        perspective and can be both proactive and reactive.  In the proactive
        case, the TE control system takes preventive action to protect against
        predicted unfavorable future network states, for example, by
        engineering backup paths.  
It may also take action that will lead to a
        more desirable future network state.  In the reactive case, the
        control system responds to correct issues and adapt to network
        events, such as routing after failure.</t>
        <t>Another important objective of Internet TE is to facilitate
        reliable network operations <xref target="RFC2702" format="default"/>.
        Reliable network operations can be facilitated by providing mechanisms
        that enhance network integrity and by embracing policies emphasizing
        network survivability.  This reduces the vulnerability of services to
        outages arising from errors, faults, and failures occurring within the
        network infrastructure.</t>
        <t>The optimization aspects of TE can be achieved
       through capacity management and traffic management.  In this
       document, capacity management includes capacity planning, routing
       control, and resource management.  Network resources of particular
       interest include link bandwidth, buffer space, and computational
       resources.  In this document, traffic management includes:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal">
	  <li>Nodal traffic control functions, such as traffic conditioning,
	  queue management, and scheduling.</li>
          <li>Other functions that regulate the flow of traffic through
          the network or that arbitrate access to network resources between
          different packets or between different traffic flows.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>One major challenge of Internet TE is the realization of automated
        control capabilities that adapt quickly and cost-effectively to
        significant changes in network state, while still maintaining
        stability of the network.  Performance evaluation can assess the
        effectiveness of TE methods, and the results of this evaluation can be
        used to identify existing problems, guide network reoptimization, and
        aid in the prediction of potential future problems.  However, this
        process can also be time-consuming and may not be suitable to act on
        short-lived changes in the network.</t>
        <t>Performance evaluation can be achieved in many different ways.  The
       most notable techniques include analytic methods, simulation, and
       empirical methods based on measurements.</t>
        <t>Traffic engineering comes in two flavors:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A background process that constantly monitors traffic and
          network conditions and optimizes the use of resources to
          improve performance.</li>
          <li>A form of a pre-planned traffic distribution that is considered
          optimal.</li>
        </ul>

        <t>In the latter case, any deviation from the optimum distribution
        (e.g., caused by a fiber cut) is reverted upon repair without further
        optimization.  However, this form of TE relies upon the notion that
        the planned state of the network is optimal.  Hence,
        there are two levels of TE in such a mode: </t>
<ul spacing="normal">
	<li>The TE-planning task to enable optimum traffic distribution.</li>
	<li>The routing and forwarding tasks that keep traffic flows
	  attached to the pre-planned distribution.</li>
	</ul>	  
        <t>As a general rule, TE concepts and mechanisms must be sufficiently
        specific and well-defined to address known requirements but
        simultaneously flexible and extensible to accommodate
        unforeseen future demands (see <xref target="HIGHOBJ"
        format="default"/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="COMPONENTS" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Components of Traffic Engineering</name>
        <t>As mentioned in <xref target="WHATTE" format="default"/>, Internet
        traffic engineering provides performance optimization of IP networks
        while utilizing network resources economically and reliably.  Such
        optimization is supported at the control/controller level and within
        the data/forwarding plane.</t>
        <t>The key elements required in any TE solution are as follows:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Policy</li>
          <li>Path steering</li>
          <li>Resource management</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Some TE solutions rely on these elements to a lesser or greater
        extent.  Debate remains about whether a solution can truly be
        called "TE" if it does not include all of these elements.  For the sake
        of this document, we assert that all TE solutions must include some
        aspects of all of these elements.  Other solutions can be classed as
        "partial TE" and also fall in scope of this document.</t>
        <t>Policy allows for the selection of paths (including next hops)
        based on information beyond basic reachability.  Early definitions of
        routing policy, e.g., <xref target="RFC1102" format="default"/> and
        <xref target="RFC1104" format="default"/>, discuss routing policy
        being applied to restrict access to network resources at an aggregate
        level.  BGP is an example of a commonly used mechanism for applying
        such policies; see <xref target="RFC4271" format="default"/> and <xref
        target="RFC8955" format="default"/>.  In the TE context, policy
        decisions are made within the control plane or by controllers in the
        management plane and govern the selection of paths.  Examples can be
        found in <xref target="RFC4655" format="default"/> and <xref
        target="RFC5394" format="default"/>.  TE solutions may cover the
        mechanisms to distribute and/or enforce policies, but definition of
        specific policies is left to the network operator.</t>
        <t>Path steering is the ability to forward packets using more
        information than just knowledge of the next hop.  Examples of path
        steering include IPv4 source routes <xref target="RFC0791"
        format="default"/>, RSVP-TE explicit routes <xref target="RFC3209"
        format="default"/>, Segment Routing (SR) <xref target="RFC8402"
        format="default"/>, and Service Function Chaining <xref
        target="RFC7665" format="default"/>.  Path steering for TE can be
        supported via control plane protocols, by encoding in the data plane
        headers, or by a combination of the two.  This includes when control
        is provided by a controller using a network-facing control
        protocol.</t>
        <t>Resource management provides resource-aware control and forwarding.
        Examples of resources are bandwidth, buffers, and queues, all of which
        can be managed to control loss and latency.</t>
        <t>Resource reservation is the control aspect of resource management.
        It provides for domain-wide consensus about which network resources
        are used by a particular flow.  This determination may be made at a
        very coarse or very fine level.  Note that this consensus exists at
        the network control or controller level but not within the data plane.
        It may be composed purely of accounting/bookkeeping, but it typically
        includes an ability to admit, reject, or reclassify a flow based on
        policy. Such accounting can be done based on any combination of a
        static understanding of resource requirements and the use of dynamic
        mechanisms to collect requirements (e.g., via RSVP-TE <xref
        target="RFC3209" format="default"/>) and resource availability (e.g.,
        via OSPF extensions for GMPLS <xref target="RFC4203"
        format="default"/>).</t>
          <t>Resource allocation is the data plane aspect of resource
          management.  It provides for the allocation of specific node and
          link resources to specific flows.  Example resources include
          buffers, policing, and rate-shaping mechanisms that are typically
          supported via queuing.  Resource allocation also includes the matching of a flow (i.e.,
          flow classification) to a particular set of allocated resources.
          The method of flow classification and granularity of resource
          management is technology-specific. Examples include Diffserv with
          dropping and remarking <xref target="RFC4594" format="default"/>,
          MPLS-TE <xref target="RFC3209" format="default"/>, GMPLS-based Label
          Switched Paths (LSPs) <xref target="RFC3945" format="default"/>, as
          well as controller-based solutions <xref target="RFC8453"
          format="default"/>.  This level of resource control, while optional,
          is important in networks that wish to support network congestion
          management policies to control or regulate the offered traffic to
          deliver different levels of service and alleviate network
          congestion problems. It is also important in networks that wish to control the
          latency experienced by specific traffic flows.</t>

      <section anchor="SCOPE" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Scope</name>
        <t>The scope of this document is intra-domain TE because this is the
        practical level of TE technology that exists in the Internet at the
        time of writing.  That is, this document describes TE within a given
        AS in the Internet.  This document discusses concepts
        pertaining to intra-domain traffic control, including such issues as
        routing control, micro and macro resource allocation, and control
        coordination problems that arise consequently.</t>
        <t>This document describes and characterizes techniques already in use
        or in advanced development for Internet TE.  The way these techniques
        fit together is discussed and scenarios in which they are useful are
        identified.</t>
        <t>Although the emphasis in this document is on intra-domain traffic
        engineering, an overview of the high-level considerations pertaining
        to inter-domain TE is provided in <xref target="INTER"
        format="default"/>.  Inter-domain Internet TE is crucial to the
        performance enhancement of the world-wide Internet infrastructure.</t>
        <t>Whenever possible, relevant requirements from existing IETF
        documents and other sources are incorporated by reference.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="TERMS" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Terminology</name>
	<t>This section provides terminology that is useful for Internet TE.
        The definitions presented apply to this document.  These terms may
        have other meanings elsewhere.</t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Busy hour:</dt>
          <dd>A one-hour period within a specified interval of time (typically
          24 hours) in which the traffic load in a network or sub-network is
          greatest.</dd>
          <dt>Congestion:</dt>
          <dd>A state of a network resource in which the traffic incident on
          the resource exceeds its output capacity over an interval of time.
          A small amount of congestion may be beneficial to ensure that
          network resources are run at full capacity, and this may be
          particularly true at the network edge where it is desirable to
          ensure that user traffic is served as much as possible.  Within the
          network, if congestion is allowed to build (such as when input
          traffic exceeds output traffic in a sustained way), it will have a
          negative effect on user traffic.</dd>
          <dt>Congestion avoidance:</dt>
          <dd>An approach to congestion management that attempts to obviate
          the occurrence of congestion.  It is chiefly relevant to network
          congestion, although it may form a part of demand-side congestion
          management.</dd>
          <dt>Congestion response:</dt>
          <dd>An approach to congestion management that attempts to remedy
          congestion problems that have already occurred.</dd>
          <dt>Constraint-based routing:</dt>
          <dd>A class of routing protocols that takes specified traffic
          attributes, network constraints, and policy constraints into account
          when making routing decisions.  Constraint-based routing is
          applicable to traffic aggregates as well as flows.  It is a
          generalization of QoS-based routing.</dd>
          <dt>Demand-side congestion management:</dt>
          <dd>A congestion management scheme that addresses congestion
          problems by regulating or conditioning the offered load.</dd>
          <dt>Effective bandwidth:</dt>
          <dd>The minimum amount of bandwidth that can be assigned to a flow
          or traffic aggregate in order to deliver "acceptable service
          quality" to the flow or traffic aggregate.  See <xref target="KELLY"
          format="default"/> for a more mathematical definition.</dd>
          <dt>Egress node:</dt>
          <dd>The device (router) at which traffic leaves a network toward a
          destination (host, server, etc.) or to another network.</dd>
          <dt>End-to-end:</dt>
          <dd>This term is context-dependent and often applies to the life of
          a traffic flow from original source to final destination.
In contrast, edge-to-edge is often used to describe the traffic flow from the
entry of a domain or network to the exit of that domain or network.  However,
in some contexts (for example, where there is a service interface between a
network and the client of that network or where a path traverses multiple
domains under the control of a single process), end-to-end is used to refer to
the full operation of the service that may be composed of concatenated
edge-to-edge operations.  Thus, in the context of TE, the term "end-to-end"
may refer to the full TE path but not to the complete path of the traffic from
source application to ultimate destination.</dd>
          <dt>Hotspot:</dt>
          <dd>A network element or subsystem that is in a considerably higher
          state of congestion than others.</dd>
          <dt>Ingress node:</dt>
          <dd>The device (router) at which traffic enters a network from a
          source (host) or from another network.</dd>
          <dt>Metric:</dt>
          <dd>A parameter defined in terms of standard units of
          measurement.</dd>
          <dt>Measurement methodology:</dt>
          <dd>
           A repeatable measurement technique used to derive one or
           more metrics of interest.</dd>
          <dt>Network congestion:</dt>
          <dd>
           Congestion within the network at a specific node or a specific link
           that is sufficiently extreme that it results in
           unacceptable queuing delay or packet loss.  Network congestion can
           negatively impact end-to-end or edge-to-edge traffic flows, so TE
           schemes may be deployed to balance traffic in the network and
           deliver congestion avoidance.</dd>
          <dt>Network survivability:</dt>
          <dd>
           The capability to provide a prescribed level of QoS for
           existing services after a given number of failures occur
           within the network.</dd>
          <dt>Offered load:</dt>
          <dd>Offered load is also sometimes called "offered traffic load". It
          is a measure of the amount of traffic being presented to be carried
          across a network compared to the capacity of the network to carry
          it. This term derives from queuing theory, and an offered load of 1
          indicates that the network can carry, but only just manage to carry,
          all of the traffic presented to it.</dd>
          <dt>Offline traffic engineering:</dt>
          <dd>
           A traffic engineering system that exists outside of the
           network.</dd>
          <dt>Online traffic engineering:</dt>
          <dd>
           A traffic-engineering system that exists within the network,
           typically implemented on or as adjuncts to operational
           network elements.</dd>
          <dt>Performance measures:</dt>
          <dd>
           Metrics that provide quantitative or qualitative measures of
           the performance of systems or subsystems of interest.</dd>
          <dt>Performance metric:</dt>
          <dd>
           A performance parameter defined in terms of standard units
           of measurement.</dd>
          <dt>Provisioning:</dt>
          <dd>
           The process of assigning or configuring network resources to
           meet certain requests.</dd>
          <dt>Quality of Service (QoS):</dt>
          <dd>
           QoS <xref target="RFC3198" format="default"/> refers to the
           mechanisms used within a network to achieve specific goals for the
           delivery of traffic for a particular service according to the
           parameters specified in a Service Level Agreement.  "Quality"
           is characterized by service availability, delay, jitter, throughput,
           and packet loss ratio.  At a network resource level, "Quality of
           Service" refers to a set of capabilities that allow a service
           provider to prioritize traffic, control bandwidth, and network
           latency.</dd>
          <dt>QoS routing:</dt>
          <dd>
           Class of routing systems that selects paths to be used by a
           flow based on the QoS requirements of the flow.</dd>
          <dt>Service Level Agreement (SLA):</dt>
          <dd>
           A contract between a provider and a customer that guarantees
           specific levels of performance and reliability at a certain

          <dd>
           A stream of packets between two endpoints that can be

      <name>Background</name>
      <t>The Internet aims to convey IP packets from ingress nodes to egress nodes
     efficiently, expeditiously, and economically.  Furthermore, in a
     multi-class service environment (e.g., Diffserv capable networks; see
     <xref target="DIFFSERV" format="default"/>), the resource-sharing parameters of the
     network must be appropriately determined and configured according to
     prevailing policies and service models to resolve resource contention
     issues arising from mutual interference between packets traversing
     the network.  Thus, consideration must be given to resolving
     competition for network resources between traffic flows belonging to
     the same service class (intra-class contention resolution) and traffic
     flows belonging to different classes (inter-class contention
     resolution).</t>

        <t>The context of Internet traffic engineering includes the following sub-contexts:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	  <li>A network domain context that defines the scope under

        <t>The context of Internet TE and the different problem
       scenarios are discussed in the following subsections.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="NWCTXT" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Network Domain Context</name>
        <t>IP networks range in size from small clusters of routers situated
        within a given location to thousands of interconnected routers,
        switches, and other components distributed all over the world.</t>
        <t>At the most basic level of abstraction, an IP network can be
        represented as a distributed dynamic system consisting of:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>a set of interconnected resources that provide transport
          services for IP traffic subject to certain constraints</li>
          <li>a demand system representing the offered load to be transported
          through the network</li>
          <li>a response system consisting of network processes, protocols,
          and related mechanisms that facilitate the movement of traffic
          through the network (see also <xref target="AWD2"
          format="default"/>)</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The network elements and resources may have specific
        characteristics restricting the manner in which the traffic demand is
        handled.  Additionally, network resources may be equipped with traffic
        control mechanisms managing the way in which the demand is serviced.
        Traffic control mechanisms may be used to:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>control packet processing activities within a given
          resource</li>
          <li>arbitrate contention for access to the resource by different
          packets</li>
          <li>regulate traffic behavior through the resource</li>
        </ul>
        <t>A configuration management and provisioning system may allow the
        settings of the traffic control mechanisms to be manipulated by
        external or internal entities in order to exercise control over the
        way in which the network elements respond to internal and external
        stimuli.</t>
        <t>The details of how the network carries packets are specified in the
        policies of the network administrators and are installed through
        network configuration management and policy-based provisioning
        systems.  Generally, the types of service provided by the network also
        depend upon the technology and characteristics of the network elements
        and protocols, the prevailing service and utility models, and the
        ability of the network administrators to translate policies into
        network configurations.</t>
        <t>Internet networks have two significant characteristics:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>They provide real-time services.</li>
          <li>Their operating environments are very dynamic.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The dynamic characteristics of IP and IP/MPLS networks can be
        attributed in part to fluctuations in demand, the interaction between
        various network protocols and processes, the rapid evolution of the
        infrastructure that demands the constant inclusion of new technologies
        and new network elements, and the transient and persistent faults that
        occur within the system.</t>
        <t>Packets contend for the use of network resources as they are
        conveyed through the network.  A network resource is considered to be
        congested if, for an interval of time, the arrival rate of packets
        exceeds the output capacity of the resource.  Network congestion may
        result in some of the arriving packets being delayed or even
        dropped.</t>
        <t>Network congestion increases transit delay and delay variation, may
        lead to packet loss, and reduces the predictability of network
        services.  Clearly, while congestion may be a useful tool at ingress
        edge nodes, network congestion is highly undesirable.  Combating
        network congestion at a reasonable cost is a major objective of
        Internet TE, although it may need to be traded with other objectives to
        keep the costs reasonable.</t>
        <t>Efficient sharing of network resources by multiple traffic flows is
        a basic operational premise for the Internet.  A fundamental challenge
        in network operation is to increase resource utilization while
        minimizing the possibility of congestion.</t>
        <t>The Internet has to function in the presence of different classes
        of traffic with different service requirements.  This requirement is
        clarified in the architecture for Differentiated Services (Diffserv)
        <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/>.  That document describes
        how packets can be grouped into behavior aggregates such that each
        aggregate has a common set of behavioral characteristics or a common
        set of delivery requirements.  Delivery requirements of a specific set
        of packets may be specified explicitly or implicitly.  Two of the most
        important traffic delivery requirements are:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Capacity constraints can be expressed statistically as peak
          rates, mean rates, burst sizes, or as some deterministic notion of
          effective bandwidth.</li>
          <li><t>QoS requirements can be expressed in terms of:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>integrity constraints, such as packet loss</li>
              <li>temporal constraints, such as timing restrictions for the
              delivery of each packet (delay) and timing restrictions for the
              delivery of consecutive packets belonging to the same traffic
              stream (delay variation)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="PRBCTXT" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Problem Context</name>
        <t>There are several problems associated with operating a
       network like those described in the previous section.  This section analyzes
       the problem context in relation to TE.  The
       identification, abstraction, representation, and measurement of
       network features relevant to TE are significant
       issues.</t>
        <t>A particular challenge is to formulate the problems that traffic
       engineering attempts to solve.  For example:
        </t>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>How to identify the requirements on the solution space</li>
          <li>How to specify the desirable features of solutions</li>
          <li>How to actually solve the problems</li>
          <li>How to measure and characterize the effectiveness of
            solutions</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Another class of problems is how to measure and estimate
       relevant network state parameters.  Effective TE
       relies on a good estimate of the offered traffic load as well as a
       view of the underlying topology and associated resource constraints.
       Offline planning requires a full view of the topology of the network
       or partial network that is being planned.</t>
        <t>Still another class of problem is how to characterize the state of
        the network and how to evaluate its performance.  The performance
        evaluation problem is two-fold: one aspect relates to the evaluation
        of the system-level performance of the network, and the other aspect
        relates to the evaluation of resource-level performance, which
        restricts attention to the performance analysis of individual network
        resources.</t>
        <t>In this document, we refer to the system-level characteristics of
        the network as the "macro-states" and the resource-level
        characteristics as the "micro-states."  The system-level
        characteristics are also known as the emergent properties of the
        network.  Correspondingly, we refer to the TE schemes dealing with
        network performance optimization at the systems level as "macro-TE"
        and the schemes that optimize at the individual resource level as
        "micro-TE."  Under certain circumstances, the system-level performance
        can be derived from the resource-level performance using appropriate
        rules of composition, depending upon the particular performance
        measures of interest.</t>
        <t>Another fundamental class of problem concerns how to effectively
       optimize network performance.  Performance optimization may entail
       translating solutions for specific TE problems into
       network configurations.  Optimization may also entail some degree of
       resource management control, routing control, and capacity
       augmentation.</t>
        <section anchor="CONGEST" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Congestion and Its Ramifications</name>
          <t>Network congestion is one of the most significant problems in an operational
         IP context.  A network element is said to be congested if it
         experiences sustained overload over an interval of time.  Although congestion
         at the edge of the network may be beneficial in ensuring that the network
         delivers as much traffic as possible, network congestion
         almost always results in degradation of service quality to end users.
         Congestion avoidance and response schemes can include demand-side policies and
         supply-side policies.  Demand-side policies may restrict access to
         congested resources or dynamically regulate the demand to alleviate
         the overload situation.  Supply-side policies may expand or augment
         network capacity to better accommodate offered traffic.  Supply-side
         policies may also reallocate network resources by redistributing
         traffic over the infrastructure.  Traffic redistribution and resource
         reallocation serve to increase the effective capacity of the network.</t>
          <t>The emphasis of this document is primarily on congestion management
         schemes falling within the scope of the network, rather than on
         congestion management systems dependent upon sensitivity and
         adaptivity from end systems.  That is, the aspects that are
         considered in this document with respect to congestion management are
         those solutions that can be provided by control entities operating on
         the network and by the actions of network administrators and network
         operations systems.</t>

      <section anchor="SLNCTXT" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Solution Context</name>
        <t>The solution context for Internet TE involves analysis,
        evaluation of alternatives, and choice between alternative courses
        of action.  Generally, the solution context is based on making
        inferences about the current or future state of the network and making
        decisions that may involve a preference between alternative sets of
        action.  More specifically, the solution context demands reasonable
        estimates of traffic workload, characterization of network state,
        derivation of solutions that may be implicitly or explicitly
        formulated, and possibly instantiation of a set of control
        actions.  Control actions may involve the manipulation of parameters
        associated with routing, control over tactical capacity acquisition,
        and control over the traffic management functions.</t>
        <t>The following list of instruments may be applicable to the solution
       context of Internet TE:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A set of policies, objectives, and requirements (which may be
          context dependent) for network performance evaluation and
          performance optimization.</li>
          <li>A collection of online and, in some cases, possibly offline tools
          and mechanisms for measurement, characterization, modeling,
          control of traffic, control over the placement and allocation of
          network resources, as well as control over the mapping or
          distribution of traffic onto the infrastructure.</li>
          <li>A set of constraints on the operating environment, the network
          protocols, and the TE system itself.</li>
          <li>A set of quantitative and qualitative techniques and
          methodologies for abstracting, formulating, and solving TE
          problems.</li>
          <li>A set of administrative control parameters that may be
          manipulated through a configuration management system.  Such a
          system may itself include a configuration control subsystem, a
          configuration repository, a configuration accounting subsystem, and
          a configuration auditing subsystem.</li>
          <li>A set of guidelines for network performance evaluation,
          performance optimization, and performance improvement.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Determining traffic characteristics through measurement or
        estimation is very useful within the realm of the TE solution space.
        Traffic estimates can be derived from customer subscription
        information, traffic projections, traffic models, and actual
        measurements.  The measurements may be performed at different levels,
        e.g., at the traffic-aggregate level or at the flow level.
        Measurements at the flow level or on small traffic aggregates may be
        performed at edge nodes, when traffic enters and leaves the network.
        Measurements for large traffic aggregates may be performed within the
        core of the network.</t>
        <t>To conduct performance studies and to support planning of existing
        and future networks, a routing analysis may be performed to determine
        the paths the routing protocols will choose for various traffic
        demands and to ascertain the utilization of network resources as
        traffic is routed through the network.  Routing analysis captures the
        selection of paths through the network, the assignment of traffic
        across multiple feasible routes, and the multiplexing of IP traffic
        over traffic trunks (if such constructs exist) and over the underlying
        network infrastructure.  A model of network topology is necessary to
        perform routing analysis.  A network topology model may be extracted
        from:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>network architecture documents</li>
          <li>network designs</li>
          <li>information contained in router configuration files</li>
          <li>routing databases such as the link-state database of an Interior
          Gateway Protocol (IGP)</li>
          <li>routing tables</li>
          <li>automated tools that discover and collate network topology
          information</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Topology information may also be derived from servers that monitor
        network state and from servers that perform provisioning
        functions.</t>
        <t>Routing in operational IP networks can be administratively
        controlled at various levels of abstraction, including the manipulation
        of BGP attributes and IGP metrics.  For path-oriented technologies
        such as MPLS, routing can be further controlled by the manipulation of
        relevant TE parameters, resource parameters, and administrative policy
        constraints.  Within the context of MPLS, the path of an explicitly
        routed LSP can be computed and established in
        various ways, including:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>manually</li>
          <li>automatically and online using constraint-based routing processes
          implemented on Label Switching Routers (LSRs)</li>
          <li>automatically and offline using constraint-based routing entities

          <name>Combating the Congestion Problem</name>
          <t>Minimizing congestion is a significant aspect of Internet traffic
          engineering.  This subsection gives an overview of the general
          approaches that have been used or proposed to combat congestion.</t>
          <t>Congestion management policies can be categorized based upon the
          following criteria (see <xref target="YARE95" format="default"/> for
          a more detailed taxonomy of congestion control schemes):</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
              <t>Congestion Management Based on Response Timescales </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>Long (weeks to months): Expanding network capacity by
                adding new equipment, routers, and links takes time and is
                comparatively costly.  Capacity planning needs to take this
                into consideration.  Network capacity is expanded based on
                estimates or forecasts of future traffic development and
                traffic distribution.  These upgrades are typically carried
                out over weeks, months, or maybe even years.</li>
                <li><t>Medium (minutes to days): Several control policies fall
                within the medium timescale category.  Examples include:</t>
                  <ol spacing="normal" type="a">
		    <li>Adjusting routing protocol parameters to route traffic
		    away from or towards certain segments of the network.</li>
                    <li>Setting up or adjusting explicitly routed LSPs in MPLS
                    networks to route traffic trunks away from possibly
                    congested resources or toward possibly more favorable
                    routes.</li>
                    <li>Reconfiguring the logical topology of the network to
                    make it correlate more closely with the spatial traffic
                    distribution using, for example, an underlying
                    path-oriented technology such as MPLS LSPs or optical
                    channel trails.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <t>When these schemes are adaptive, they rely on measurement
                  systems.  A measurement system monitors changes in traffic

                  utilization and then provides feedback to the online or
                  offline TE mechanisms and tools so that they can trigger
                  control actions within the network.  The TE mechanisms and
                  tools can be implemented in a distributed or centralized
                  fashion.  A centralized scheme may have full visibility into
                  the network state and may produce more optimal solutions.
                  However, centralized schemes are prone to single points of
                  failure and may not scale as well as distributed schemes.
                  Moreover, the information utilized by a centralized scheme
                  may be stale and might not reflect the actual state of the
                  network.  It is not an objective of this document to make a
                  recommendation between distributed and centralized schemes;
                  that is a choice that network administrators must make based
                  on their specific needs.</t>

                <li>Short (minutes or less): This category includes
                packet-level processing functions and events that are recorded
                on the order of several round-trip times.  It also includes
                router mechanisms such as passive and active buffer
                management.  All of these mechanisms are used to control
                congestion or signal congestion to end systems so that they
                can adaptively regulate the rate at which traffic is injected
                into the network.  A well-known active queue management
                scheme, especially for responsive traffic such as TCP, is
                Random Early Detection (RED) <xref target="FLJA93"
                format="default"/>.  During congestion (but before the queue
                is filled), the RED scheme chooses arriving packets to "mark"
                according to a probabilistic algorithm that takes into account
                the average queue size.  A router that does not utilize
                Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"
                format="default"/> can simply drop marked packets to alleviate
                congestion and implicitly notify the receiver about the
                congestion.  On the other hand, if the router and the end
                hosts support ECN, they can set the ECN field in the packet
                header, and the end host can act on this information.  Several
                variations of RED have been proposed to support different drop
                precedence levels in multi-class environments <xref
                target="RFC2597" format="default"/>.  RED provides congestion
                avoidance that is better than or equivalent to Tail-Drop (TD)
                queue management (drop arriving packets only when the queue is
                full).  Importantly, RED reduces the possibility of
                retransmission bursts becoming synchronized within the network
                and improves fairness among different responsive traffic
                sessions.  However, RED by itself cannot prevent congestion
                and unfairness caused by sources unresponsive to RED, e.g.,
                some misbehaved greedy connections.  Other schemes have been
                proposed to improve performance and fairness in the presence
                of unresponsive traffic.  Some of those schemes (such as
                Longest Queue Drop (LQD) and Dynamic Soft Partitioning with
                Random Drop (RND) <xref target="SLDC98" format="default"/>)
                were proposed as theoretical frameworks and are typically not
                available in existing commercial products, while others (such
                as Approximate Fair Dropping (AFD) <xref target="AFD03"
                format="default"/>) have seen some implementation.  Advice on
                the use of Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes is provided
                in <xref target="RFC7567" format="default"/>.  <xref
                target="RFC7567" format="default"/> recommends self-tuning AQM
                algorithms like those that the IETF has published in <xref

                and <xref target="RFC9332" format="default"/>, but RED is

                on the initiation of relevant actions to ease a situation.
                Reactive congestion management schemes may also be

                <li>Preventive (predictive/avoidance) policies take proactive

                matrix forecasts).  Some of the policies described for the
                long and medium timescales fall into this category.
                Preventive policies do not necessarily respond immediately to
                existing congestion problems.  Instead, forecasts of traffic
                demand and workload distribution are considered, and action
                may be taken to prevent potential future congestion problems.
                The schemes described for the short timescale can also be used
                for congestion avoidance because dropping or marking packets
                before queues actually overflow would trigger corresponding

Capacity planning aims to provide a physical

      <name>Traffic-Engineering Process Models</name>
      <t>This section describes a generic process model that captures the
      high-level practical aspects of Internet traffic engineering in an
      operational context.  The process model is described as a sequence of
      actions that must be carried out to optimize the performance of an
      operational network (see also <xref target="RFC2702" format="default"/>
      and <xref target="AWD2" format="default"/>).  This process model may be
      enacted explicitly or implicitly, by a software process or by a
      human.</t>
      <t>The TE process model is iterative <xref target="AWD2"

        <name>Components of the Traffic-Engineering Process Model</name>
        <t>The key components of the traffic-engineering process model are as
        follows:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Measurement is crucial to the TE
        function.  The operational state of a network can only be conclusively
        determined through measurement.  Measurement is also critical to the
        optimization function because it provides feedback data that is used
        by TE control subsystems.  This data is used to adaptively optimize
        network performance in response to events and stimuli originating
        within and outside the network.  Measurement in support of the TE
        function can occur at different levels of abstraction.  For example,
        measurement can be used to derive packet-level characteristics, flow-level characteristics, user- or customer-level characteristics, traffic-aggregate characteristics, component-level characteristics, and
        network-wide characteristics.</li>
          <li>Modeling, analysis, and simulation are important aspects of
          Internet TE.  Modeling involves constructing an abstract or physical
          representation that depicts relevant traffic characteristics and
          network attributes.  A network model is an abstract representation
          of the network that captures relevant network features, attributes,
          and characteristics.  Network simulation tools are extremely useful
          for TE.  Because of the complexity of realistic quantitative
          analysis of network behavior, certain aspects of network performance
          studies can only be conducted effectively using simulation.</li>
          <li>Network performance optimization involves resolving network
              issues by transforming such issues into concepts that enable a
              solution, identification of a solution, and implementation of the
              solution.  Network performance optimization can be corrective or
              perfective.  In corrective optimization, the goal is to remedy a
              problem that has occurred or that is incipient.  In perfective
              optimization, the goal is to improve network performance even
              when explicit problems do not exist and are not anticipated.</li>

      <section anchor="TIME" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Time-Dependent versus State-Dependent versus Event-Dependent</name>
        <t>Traffic-engineering methodologies can be classified as
        time-dependent, state-dependent, or event-dependent.  All TE schemes
        are considered to be dynamic in this document.  Static TE implies that
        no TE methodology or algorithm is being applied -- it is a feature of
        network planning but lacks the reactive and flexible nature of
        TE.</t>
        <t>In time-dependent TE, historical information based on periodic
        variations in traffic (such as time of day) is used to pre-program
        routing and other TE control mechanisms.  Additionally, customer
        subscription or traffic projection may be used.  Pre-programmed
        routing plans typically change on a relatively long timescale (e.g.,
        daily).  Time-dependent algorithms do not attempt to adapt to
        short-term variations in traffic or changing network conditions.  An
        example of a time-dependent algorithm is a centralized optimizer where
        the input to the system is a traffic matrix and multi-class QoS
        requirements as described in <xref target="MR99" format="default"/>.
        Another example of such a methodology is the application of data
        mining to Internet traffic <xref target="AJ19" format="default"/>,
        which enables the use of various machine learning algorithms to
        identify patterns within historically collected datasets about
        Internet traffic and to extract information in order to guide
        decision-making and improve efficiency and productivity of
        operational processes.</t>
        <t>State-dependent TE adapts the routing plans based on the current
        state of the network, which provides additional information on
        variations in actual traffic (i.e., perturbations from regular
        variations) that could not be predicted using historical information.
        Constraint-based routing is an example of state-dependent TE operating
        in a relatively long timescale.  An example of operating in a
        relatively short timescale is a load-balancing algorithm described in
        <xref target="MATE" format="default"/>.  The state of the network can
        be based on parameters flooded by the routers.  Another approach is
        for a particular router performing adaptive TE to send probe packets
        along a path to gather the state of that path.  <xref target="RFC6374"
        format="default"/> defines protocol extensions to collect performance
        measurements from MPLS networks.  Another approach is for a management
        system to gather the relevant information directly from network
        elements using telemetry data collection publication/subscription
        techniques <xref target="RFC7923" format="default"/>.  Timely
        gathering and distribution of state information is critical for
        adaptive TE.  While time-dependent algorithms are suitable for
        predictable traffic variations, state-dependent algorithms may be
        needed to increase network efficiency and to provide resilience to
        adapt to changes in network state.</t>
	<t>Event-dependent TE methods can also be used for TE path selection.
	Event-dependent TE methods are distinct from time-dependent and
	state-dependent TE methods in the manner in which paths are selected.
	These algorithms are adaptive and distributed in nature, and they
	typically use learning models to find good paths for TE in a network.
	While state-dependent TE models typically use available-link-bandwidth
	(ALB) flooding <xref target="E.360.1" format="default"/> for TE path
	selection, event-dependent TE methods do not require ALB flooding.
	Rather, event-dependent TE methods typically search out capacity by
	learning models, as in the success-to-the-top (STT) method <xref
	target="RFC6601" format="default"/>. ALB flooding can be resource
	intensive, since it requires link bandwidth to carry routing protocol
	link-state advertisements and processor capacity to process those
	advertisements; in addition, the overhead of the ALB advertisements and
	their processing can limit the size of the area and AS.  Modeling
	results suggest that event-dependent TE methods could lead to a
	reduction in ALB flooding overhead without loss of network throughput
	performance <xref target="I-D.ietf-tewg-qos-routing"
	format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>A fully functional TE system is likely to use all aspects of
        time-dependent, state-dependent, and event-dependent methodologies as
        described in <xref target="HYBRID" format="default"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="OFFON" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Offline versus Online</name>
        <t>Traffic engineering requires the computation of routing plans.  The
        computation may be performed offline or online.  The computation can
        be done offline for scenarios where routing plans need not be executed
        in real time.  For example, routing plans computed from forecast
        information may be computed offline.  Typically, offline computation
        is also used to perform extensive searches on multi-dimensional
        solution spaces.</t>
        <t>Online computation is required when the routing plans must adapt to
        changing network conditions as in state-dependent algorithms.  Unlike
        offline computation (which can be computationally demanding), online
        computation is geared toward relatively simple and fast calculations
        to select routes, fine-tune the allocations of resources, and perform
        load balancing.</t>

      <section anchor="CENTRAL" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Centralized versus Distributed</name>
        <t>Under centralized control, there is a central authority that
        determines routing plans and perhaps other TE control parameters on
        behalf of each router.  The central authority periodically collects
        network-state information from all routers and sends routing
        information to the routers.  The update cycle for information exchange
        in both directions is a critical parameter directly impacting the
        performance of the network being controlled.  Centralized control may
        need high processing power and high bandwidth control channels.</t>
        <t>Distributed control determines route selection by each router
        autonomously based on the router's view of the state of the network.
        The network state information may be obtained by the router using a
        probing method or distributed by other routers on a periodic basis
        using link-state advertisements.  Network state information may also
        be disseminated under exception conditions.  Examples of protocol
        extensions used to advertise network link-state information are
        defined in <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/>, <xref
        target="RFC6119" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC7471"

        <section anchor="HYBRID" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Hybrid Systems</name>
          <t>In practice, most TE systems will be a hybrid of central and
          distributed control.  For example, a popular MPLS approach to TE is
          to use a central controller based on an active, stateful Path
          Computation Element (PCE) but to use routing and signaling protocols
          to make local decisions at routers within the network.  Local
          decisions may be able to respond more quickly to network events but
          may result in conflicts with decisions made by other routers.</t>
          <t>Network operations for TE systems may also use a hybrid of
          offline and online computation.  TE paths may be precomputed based
          on stable-state network information and planned traffic demands but
          may then be modified in the active network depending on variations
          in network state and traffic load.  Furthermore, responses to
          network events may be precomputed offline to allow rapid reactions
          without further computation or may be derived online depending on
          the nature of the events.</t>

        <section anchor="SDN" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Considerations for Software-Defined Networking</name>
          <t>As discussed in <xref target="ACTN" format="default"/>, one of
          the main drivers for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a
          decoupling of the network control plane from the data plane <xref
          target="RFC7149" format="default"/>. However, SDN may also combine
          centralized control of resources and facilitate
          application-to-network interaction via an Application Programming
          Interface (API), such as the one described in <xref target="RFC8040"
          format="default"/>. Combining these features provides a flexible
          network architecture that can adapt to the network requirements of a
          variety of higher-layer applications, a concept often referred to as
          the "programmable network" <xref target="RFC7426"
          format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>The centralized control aspect of SDN helps improve network
          resource utilization compared with distributed network control,
          where local policy may often override network-wide optimization
          goals.  In an SDN environment, the data plane forwards traffic to
          its desired destination. However, before traffic reaches the data
          plane, the logically centralized SDN control plane often determines
          the path the application traffic will take in the network.
          Therefore, the SDN control plane needs to be aware of the underlying
          network topology, capabilities, and current node and link resource
          state.</t>
          <t>Using a PCE-based SDN control framework <xref target="RFC7491"
          format="default"/>, the available network topology may be discovered
          by running a passive instance of OSPF or IS-IS, or via BGP Link
          State (BGP-LS) <xref target="RFC9552" format="default"/>), to
          generate a Traffic Engineering Database (TED) (see <xref
          target="STATE" format="default"/>).  The PCE is used to compute a
          path (see <xref target="PCE" format="default"/>) based on the TED
          and available bandwidth, and further path optimization may be based
          on requested objective functions <xref target="RFC5541"
          format="default"/>.  When a suitable path has been computed, the
          programming of the explicit network path may be either performed
          using a signaling protocol that traverses the length of the path
          <xref target="RFC3209" format="default"/> or performed per-hop with
          each node being directly programmed <xref target="RFC8283"
          format="default"/> by the SDN controller.</t>
          <t>By utilizing a centralized approach to network control,
          additional network benefits are also available, including Global
          Concurrent Optimization (GCO) <xref target="RFC5557"
          format="default"/>.  A GCO path computation request will
          simultaneously use the network topology and a set of new path
          signaling requests, along with their respective constraints, for
          optimal placement in the network.  Correspondingly, a GCO-based
          computation may be applied to recompute existing network paths to
          groom traffic and to mitigate congestion.</t>

<blockquote>
	  A set of operational goals (that a network should meet) and outcomes

            <name>Integrated Services</name>
            <t>The IETF developed the Integrated Services (Intserv) model that
            requires resources, such as bandwidth and buffers, to be reserved
            a priori for a given traffic flow to ensure that the QoS requested
            by the traffic flow is satisfied.  The Intserv model includes
            additional components beyond those used in the best-effort model
            such as packet classifiers, packet schedulers, and admission
            control.  A packet classifier is used to identify flows that are
            to receive a certain level of service.  A packet scheduler handles
            the scheduling of service to different packet flows to ensure that
            QoS commitments are met.  Admission control is used to determine
            whether a router has the necessary resources to accept a new
            flow.</t>
            <t>The main issue with the Intserv model has been scalability
            <xref target="RFC2998" format="default"/>, especially in large
            public IP networks that may potentially have millions of active
            traffic flows in transit concurrently.  Pre-Congestion
            Notification (PCN) <xref target="RFC5559" format="default"/>
            solves the scaling problems of Intserv by using measurement-based
            admission control (and flow termination to handle failures)
            between edge nodes.  Nodes between the edges of the internetwork
            have no per-flow operations, and the edge nodes can use the
            Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) per-flow or
            per-aggregate.</t>
            <t>A notable feature of the Intserv model is that it requires
            explicit signaling of QoS requirements from end systems to routers
            <xref target="RFC2753" format="default"/>.  RSVP performs this
            signaling function and is a critical component of the Intserv
            model.  RSVP is described in <xref target="RSVP"
            format="default"/>.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="DIFFSERV" numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Differentiated Services</name>
            <t>The goal of Differentiated Services (Diffserv) within the IETF
            was to devise scalable mechanisms for categorization of traffic
            into behavior aggregates, which ultimately allows each behavior
            aggregate to be treated differently, especially when there is a
            shortage of resources, such as link bandwidth and buffer space
            <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/>.  One of the primary
            motivations for Diffserv was to devise alternative mechanisms for
            service differentiation in the Internet that mitigate the
            scalability issues encountered with the Intserv model.</t>
            <t>Diffserv uses the Differentiated Services field in the IP
            header (the DS field) consisting of six bits in what was formerly
            known as the Type of Service (TOS) octet.  The DS field is used to
            indicate the forwarding treatment that a packet should receive at
            a transit node <xref target="RFC2474" format="default"/>.
            Diffserv includes the concept of Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) groups.
            Using the PHBs, several classes of services can be defined using
            different classification, policing, shaping, and scheduling
            rules.</t>
            <t>For an end user of network services to utilize Diffserv
            provided by its Internet Service Provider (ISP), it may
            be necessary for the user to have an SLA with the ISP.  An SLA may
            explicitly or implicitly specify a Traffic Conditioning Agreement
            (TCA) that defines classifier rules as well as metering, marking,
            discarding, and shaping rules.</t>
            <t>Packets are classified and possibly policed and shaped at the
            ingress to a Diffserv network.  When a packet traverses the
            boundary between different Diffserv domains, the DS field of the
            packet may be re-marked according to existing agreements between
            the domains.</t>
            <t>Diffserv allows only a finite number of service
            classes to be specified by the DS field.  The main advantage of
            the Diffserv approach relative to the Intserv model is
            scalability.  Resources are allocated on a per-class basis, and the
            amount of state information is proportional to the number of
            classes rather than to the number of application flows.</t>
            <t>Once the network has been planned and the packets have been
            marked at the network edge, the Diffserv model deals with traffic
            management issues on a per-hop basis.  The Diffserv control model
            consists of a collection of micro-TE control mechanisms.  Other TE
            capabilities, such as capacity management (including routing
            control), are also required in order to deliver acceptable service
            quality in Diffserv networks.  The concept of "Per-Domain
            Behaviors" has been introduced to better capture the notion of
            Diffserv across a complete domain <xref target="RFC3086"
            format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>Diffserv procedures can also be applied in an MPLS context.  See

            <t>SR Policy <xref target="RFC9256" format="default"/> is an
            evolution of SR (see <xref target="SR"
            format="default"/>) to enhance the TE capabilities of SR.  It is a
            framework that enables instantiation of an ordered list of
            segments on a node for implementing a source routing policy with a
            specific intent for traffic steering from that node.</t> 
	    <t>An SR Policy is identified through the tuple &lt;headend,
	    color, endpoint&gt;. The headend is the IP address of the node
	    where the policy is instantiated.  The endpoint is the IP address
	    of the destination of the policy.  The color is an index that
	    associates the SR Policy with an intent (e.g., low latency).</t>
            <t>The headend node is notified of SR Policies and associated SR
            paths via configuration or by extensions to protocols such as the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
            <xref target="RFC8664" format="default"/> or BGP <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy"
            format="default"/>.  Each SR path consists of a segment list (an
            SR source-routed path), and the headend uses the endpoint and
            color parameters to classify packets to match the SR Policy and so
            determine along which path to forward them.  If an SR Policy is
            associated with a set of SR paths, each is associated with a
            weight for weighted load balancing.  Furthermore, multiple SR
            Policies may be associated with a set of SR paths to allow
            multiple traffic flows to be placed on the same paths.</t>
            <t>An SR Binding SID (BSID) may also be associated with each
            candidate path associated with an SR Policy or
            with the SR Policy itself.  The headend node installs a
            BSID-keyed entry in the forwarding plane and assigns it the action
            of steering packets that match the entry to the selected path of
            the SR Policy.  This steering can be done in various ways:</t>
            <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
              <dt>SID Steering:</dt><dd>Incoming packets have an active Segment Identifier (SID) matching a local BSID at

            requested.  A DetNet application can express its QoS attributes or
            traffic behavior using any combination of DetNet functions
            described in sub-layers.  They are then distributed and
            provisioned using well-established control and provisioning
            mechanisms adopted for traffic engineering.</t>
            <t>In DetNet, a considerable amount of state information is
            required to maintain per-flow queuing disciplines and resource
            reservation for a large number of individual flows.  This can be
            quite challenging for network operations during network events,
            such as faults, change in traffic volume, or reprovisioning.
            Therefore, DetNet recommends support for aggregated flows;
            however, it still requires a large amount of control signaling to
            establish and maintain DetNet flows.</t>
            <t>Note that DetNet might suffer from some of the scalability
            concerns described for Intserv in <xref target="INTSERV"
            format="default"/>, but the scope of DetNet's deployment scenarios
            is smaller and therefore less exposed to scaling issues.</t>

            <name>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization</name>
            <t>This document describes various TE mechanisms available in the
            network.  However, in general, distributed applications
            (particularly, bandwidth-greedy P2P applications that are used for
            file sharing, for example) cannot directly use those techniques.
            As per <xref target="RFC5693" format="default"/>, applications
            could greatly improve traffic distribution and quality by
            cooperating with external services that are aware of the network
            topology.  Addressing the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
            (ALTO) problem means, on the one hand, deploying an ALTO service
            to provide applications with information regarding the underlying
            network (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of
            network paths) and, on the other hand, enhancing applications in
            order to use such information to perform better-than-random
            selection of the endpoints with which they establish
            connections.</t>

            <t>The basic function of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a
            network.  These maps provide a simplified view, yet enough
            information about a network for applications to effectively
            utilize them.  Additional services are built on top of the maps.
            <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/> describes a protocol
            implementing the ALTO services as an information-publishing
            interface that allows a network to publish its network information
            to network applications.  This information can include network
            node locations, groups of node-to-node connectivity arranged by
            cost according to configurable granularities, and end-host
            properties.  The information published by the ALTO Protocol should
            benefit both the network and the applications.  The ALTO Protocol
            uses a REST-ful design and encodes its requests and responses
            using JSON <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/> with a
            modular design by dividing ALTO information publication into
            multiple ALTO services (e.g., the Map Service, the Map-Filtering
            Service, the Endpoint Property Service, and the Endpoint Cost
            Service).</t>
            <t><xref target="RFC8189" format="default"/> defines a new service
            that allows an ALTO Client to retrieve several cost metrics in a
            single request for an ALTO filtered cost map and endpoint cost
            map.  <xref target="RFC8896" format="default"/> extends the ALTO
            cost information service so that applications decide not only
            "where" to connect but also "when".  This is useful for
            applications that need to perform bulk data transfer and would
            like to schedule these transfers during an off-peak hour, for
            example.  <xref target="RFC9439" format="default"/> introduces
            network performance metrics, including network delay, jitter,
            packet loss rate, hop count, and bandwidth.  The ALTO server may
            derive and aggregate such performance metrics from BGP-LS (see
            <xref target="BGPLS" format="default"/>), IGP-TE (see <xref
            target="IGPTE" format="default"/>), or management tools and then
            expose the information to allow applications to determine "where"
            to connect based on network performance criteria.  The ALTO
            Working Group is evaluating the use of network TE properties while
            making application decisions for new use cases such as edge
            computing and data-center interconnect.</t>

            <t>IETF Network Slices are defined such that they are independent

            <name>Constraint-Based Routing</name>
            <t>Constraint-based routing refers to a class of routing systems that
           compute routes through a network subject to the satisfaction of a set
           of constraints and requirements.  In the most general case,
           constraint-based routing may also seek to optimize overall network
           performance while minimizing costs.</t>
            <t>The constraints and requirements may be imposed by the network itself
           or by administrative policies.  Constraints may include bandwidth,
           hop count, delay, and policy instruments such as resource class
           attributes.  Constraints may also include domain-specific attributes
           of certain network technologies and contexts that impose
           restrictions on the solution space of the routing function.  Path-oriented technologies such as MPLS have made constraint-based routing
           feasible and attractive in public IP networks.</t>

            <t>The concept of constraint-based routing within the context of
            MPLS-TE requirements in IP networks was first described in <xref
            target="RFC2702" format="default"/> and led to developments such
            as MPLS-TE <xref target="RFC3209" format="default"/> as described

            format="default"/>, and <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-idr-performance-routing" format="default"/>) that
            generally addresses the issue of routing individual traffic flows
            to satisfy prescribed flow-based QoS requirements subject to
            network resource availability, constraint-based routing is
            applicable to traffic aggregates as well as flows and may be
            subject to a wide variety of constraints that may include policy
            restrictions.</t>
            <section anchor="FLEX" numbered="true" toc="default">
              <name>IGP Flexible Algorithms</name>
              <t>The normal approach to routing in an IGP network relies
              on the IGPs deriving "shortest paths" over the network based
              solely on the IGP metric assigned to the links.  Such an
              approach is often limited: traffic may tend to converge
              toward the destination, possibly causing congestion, and it is
              not possible to steer traffic onto paths depending on the
              end-to-end qualities demanded by the applications.</t>
              <t>To overcome this limitation, various sorts of TE have been
              widely deployed (as described in this document), where the TE
              component is responsible for computing the path based on
              additional metrics and/or constraints.  Such paths (or tunnels)
              need to be installed in the routers' forwarding tables in
              addition to, or as a replacement for, the original paths computed
              by IGPs.  The main drawbacks of these TE approaches are the
              additional complexity of protocols and management and the state
              that may need to be maintained within the network.</t>

              <t>IGP Flexible Algorithms <xref target="RFC9350"
              format="default"/> allow IGPs to construct constraint-based
              paths over the network by computing constraint-based next hops.
              The intent of Flexible Algorithms is to reduce TE complexity by letting
              an IGP perform some basic TE computation capabilities.
              Flexible Algorithm includes a set of extensions to the IGPs that enable a
              router to send TLVs that:</t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>describe a set of constraints on the topology</li>
                <li>identify calculation-type</li>
                <li>describe a metric-type that is to be used to compute the
                best paths through the constrained topology</li>
              </ul>
              <t>A given combination of calculation-type, metric-type, and
              constraints is known as a Flexible Algorithm Definition
              (FAD).  A router that sends such a set of TLVs also assigns a
              specific identifier (the Flexible Algorithm) to the specified
              combination of calculation-type, metric-type, and
              constraints.</t>
              <t>There are two use cases for Flexible Algorithm: in IP networks <xref
              target="RFC9502" format="default"/> and in SR
              networks <xref target="RFC9350" format="default"/>.  In the
              first case, Flexible Algorithm computes paths to an IPv4 or IPv6 address;
              in the second case, Flexible Algorithms computes paths to a Prefix SID
              (see <xref target="SR" format="default"/>).</t>

            <t>RSVP is a soft-state signaling protocol <xref target="RFC2205"
            format="default"/>.  It supports receiver-initiated establishment
            of resource reservations for both multicast and unicast flows.
            RSVP was originally developed as a signaling protocol within the
            Integrated Services framework (see <xref target="INTSERV"
            format="default"/>) for applications to communicate QoS
            requirements to the network and for the network to reserve
            relevant resources to satisfy the QoS requirements <xref
            target="RFC2205" format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>In RSVP, the traffic sender or source node sends a Path message
            to the traffic receiver with the same source and destination
            addresses as the traffic that the sender will generate.  The Path
            message contains:</t>
	    <ul spacing="normal">
	      <li>A sender traffic specification describing the
	      characteristics of the traffic</li>
	      <li>A sender template specifying the format of the traffic</li>
	      <li>An optional advertisement specification that is used
	      to support the concept of One Pass With Advertising (OPWA) <xref
	      target="RFC2205" format="default"/></li>
	    </ul>
	    <t>Every intermediate router along the path forwards the Path
	    message to the next hop determined by the routing protocol.  Upon
	    receiving a Path message, the receiver responds with a Resv
	    message that includes a flow descriptor used to request resource
	    reservations.  The Resv message travels to the sender or source
	    node in the opposite direction along the path that the Path
	    message traversed.  Every intermediate router along the path can
	    reject or accept the reservation request of the Resv message.  If
	    the request is rejected, the rejecting router will send an error
	    message to the receiver, and the signaling process will terminate.
	    If the request is accepted, link bandwidth and buffer space are
	    allocated for the flow, and the related flow state information is
	    installed in the router.</t>
            <t>One of the issues with the original RSVP specification <xref
            target="RFC2205" format="default"/> was scalability.  This was
            because reservations were required for micro-flows, so that the
            amount of state maintained by network elements tended to increase
            linearly with the number of traffic flows.  These issues are
            described in <xref target="RFC2961" format="default"/>, which also
            modifies and extends RSVP to mitigate the scaling problems to make
            RSVP a versatile signaling protocol for the Internet.  For
            example, RSVP has been extended to reserve resources for
            aggregation of flows <xref target="RFC3175" format="default"/>, to
            set up MPLS explicit LSPs (see <xref target="MPLS"
            format="default"/>), and to perform other signaling functions
            within the Internet.  <xref target="RFC2961" format="default"/>
            also describes a mechanism to reduce the amount of Refresh
            messages required to maintain established RSVP sessions.</t>

            <t>MPLS is a forwarding scheme that also includes extensions to
            conventional IP control plane protocols.  MPLS extends the
            Internet routing model and enhances packet forwarding and path
            control <xref target="RFC3031" format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>At the ingress to an MPLS domain,
            LSRs classify IP packets into Forwarding Equivalence Classes
            (FECs) based on a variety of factors, including, e.g., a
            combination of the information carried in the IP header of the
            packets and the local routing information maintained by the LSRs.
            An MPLS label stack entry is then prepended to each packet
            according to their FECs.  The MPLS label
            stack entry is 32 bits long and contains a 20-bit label field.</t>
            <t>An LSR makes forwarding decisions by using the label prepended
            to packets as the index into a local Next Hop Label Forwarding
            Entry (NHLFE).  The packet is then processed as specified in the
            NHLFE.  The incoming label may be replaced by an outgoing label
            (label swap), and the packet may be forwarded to the next LSR.
            Before a packet leaves an MPLS domain, its MPLS label may be
            removed (label pop).  An LSP is the path between an ingress LSR
            and an egress LSR through which a labeled packet traverses.  The
            path of an explicit LSP is defined at the originating (ingress)
            node of the LSP.  MPLS can use a signaling protocol such as RSVP
            or the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) to set up LSPs.</t>
            <t>MPLS is a powerful technology for Internet TE because it

            <t>RSVP-TE is a protocol extension of RSVP (<xref target="RSVP"
            format="default"/>) for traffic engineering.  The base
            specification is found in <xref target="RFC3209"
            format="default"/>.  RSVP-TE enables the establishment of
            traffic-engineered MPLS LSPs (TE LSPs), using loose or strict
            paths and taking into consideration network constraints such as
            available bandwidth.  The extension supports signaling LSPs on
            explicit paths that could be administratively specified or
            computed by a suitable entity (such as a PCE, <xref target="PCE"
            format="default"/>) based on QoS and policy requirements, taking
            into consideration the prevailing network state as advertised by the
            IGP extension for IS-IS in <xref target="RFC5305"
            format="default"/>, for OSPFv2 in <xref target="RFC3630"
            format="default"/>, and for OSPFv3 in <xref target="RFC5329"
            format="default"/>.  RSVP-TE enables the reservation of resources
            (for example, bandwidth) along the path.</t>
            <t>RSVP-TE includes the ability to preempt LSPs based on
            priorities and uses link affinities to include or exclude links
            from the LSPs. The protocol is further extended to support Fast
            Reroute (FRR) <xref target="RFC4090" format="default"/>, Diffserv
            <xref target="RFC4124" format="default"/>, and bidirectional LSPs
            <xref target="RFC7551" format="default"/>.  RSVP-TE extensions for
            support for GMPLS (see <xref target="GMPLS" format="default"/>)
            are specified in <xref target="RFC3473" format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>Requirements for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS-TE LSPs are

            signaling protocol extensions for setting up P2MP MPLS-TE LSPs via
            RSVP-TE are defined in <xref target="RFC4875" format="default"/>,
            where a P2MP LSP comprises multiple source-to-leaf (S2L) sub-LSPs.
            To determine the paths for P2MP LSPs, selection of the branch
            points (based on capabilities, network state, and policies) is
            key <xref target="RFC5671" format="default"/></t>
            <t>RSVP-TE has evolved to provide real-time dynamic metrics for
            path selection for low-latency paths using extensions to IS-IS
            <xref target="RFC8570" format="default"/> and OSPF <xref
            target="RFC7471" format="default"/> based on performance
            measurements for the Simple Two-Way Active

            <xref target="RFC5357" format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>RSVP-TE has historically been used when bandwidth was
            constrained; however, as bandwidth has increased, RSVP-TE has
            developed into a bandwidth management tool to provide bandwidth

            <name>Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)</name>

            <t>GMPLS extends MPLS control protocols to encompass time-division
            (e.g., Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
            (SONET/SDH), Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH), and Optical
            Transport Network (OTN)), wavelength (lambdas), and spatial
            switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber)
            and continues to support packet switching.  GMPLS
            provides a common set of control protocols for all of these layers
            (including some technology-specific extensions), each of which has
            a distinct data or forwarding plane.  GMPLS covers both the
            signaling and the routing part of that control plane and is based
            on the TE extensions to MPLS (see <xref target="RSVP-TE"
            format="default"/>).</t>
            <t>In GMPLS <xref target="RFC3945" format="default"/>, the
            original MPLS architecture is extended to include LSRs whose
            forwarding planes rely on circuit switching and therefore cannot
            forward data based on the information carried in either packet or
            cell headers.  Specifically, such LSRs include devices where the
            switching is based on time slots, wavelengths, or physical ports.
            These additions impact basic LSP properties: how labels are
            requested and communicated, the unidirectional nature of MPLS
            LSPs, how errors are propagated, and information provided for
            synchronizing the ingress and egress LSRs <xref target="RFC3473"

            These metrics can be applied by network operators, end users, and
            independent testing groups to provide users and service providers

            metrics developed by the IPPM Working Group are described in <xref

            metrics include one-way packet loss <xref target="RFC7680"

            <t>Some of the performance metrics specified by the IPPM Working

            metrics, possibly subject to certain constraints.</t>

            in the following contexts:

            <t>A flow measurement system consists of meters, meter readers,

            data (such as the number of packets and bytes for each group), and
            stores the usage data in a flow table.  A group may represent any

            reader gathers usage data from various meters so it can be made
            available for analysis.  A manager is responsible for configuring
            and controlling meters and meter readers.  The instructions

            the allocation of buffers to meet the requirements of admitted
            traffic and may include policing and/or rate-shaping mechanisms
            achieved via various forms of queuing.  This level of resource
            control, while optional, is important in networks that wish to
            support congestion management policies to control or regulate the
            offered traffic to deliver different levels of service and
            alleviate congestion problems. It is also important in networks that
            wish to control latencies experienced by specific traffic
            flows.</t>

            <t>The TE control system needs to have a management interface that
            is human-friendly and a control interface that is programmable for
            automation.  The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) <xref

        <t>The Internet is dominated by client-server interactions,
        principally web traffic and multimedia streams, although in the
        future, more sophisticated media servers may become dominant.  The
        location and performance of major information servers have a
        significant impact on the traffic patterns within the Internet as well
        as on the perception of service quality by end users.</t>
        <t>A number of dynamic load-balancing techniques have been devised to
        improve the performance of replicated information servers.  These
        techniques can cause spatial traffic characteristics to become more
        dynamic in the Internet because information servers can be dynamically
        picked based upon the location of the clients, the location of the
        servers, the relative utilization of the servers, the relative
        performance of different networks, and the relative performance of
        different parts of a network.  This process of assignment of
        distributed servers to clients is called "traffic directing".  It is an
        application-layer function.</t>
        <t>Traffic-directing schemes that allocate servers in multiple

      <name>Recommendations for Internet Traffic Engineering</name>
      <t>This section describes high-level recommendations for traffic
      engineering in the Internet in general terms.</t>
      <t>The recommendations describe the capabilities needed to solve a TE
      problem or to achieve a TE objective.  Broadly speaking, these
      recommendations can be categorized as either functional or
      non-functional recommendations:  </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Functional recommendations describe the functions that a traffic-engineering system
        should perform.  These functions are needed to realize TE objectives
        by addressing traffic-engineering problems.</li>
        <li>Non-functional recommendations relate to the quality attributes or
        state characteristics of a TE system.  These recommendations may
        contain conflicting assertions and may sometimes be difficult to
        quantify precisely.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The subsections that follow first summarize the non-functional
      requirements and then detail the functional requirements.</t>
      <section anchor="HIGHOBJ" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Generic Non-functional Recommendations</name>
        <t>The generic non-functional recommendations for Internet traffic
        engineering are listed in the paragraphs that follow.  In a given
        context, some of these recommendations may be critical while others
        may be optional.  Therefore, prioritization may be required during the
        development phase of a TE system to tailor it to a specific
        operational context.</t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Automation:</dt>
          <dd>Whenever feasible, a TE system should automate as many TE
          functions as possible to minimize the amount of human effort needed
          to analyze and control operational networks.  Automation is
          particularly important in large-scale public networks because of the
          high cost of the human aspects of network operations and the high
          risk of network problems caused by human errors.  Automation may
          additionally benefit from feedback from the network that indicates
          the state of network resources and the current load in the network.
          Further, placing intelligence into components of the TE system could
          enable automation to be more dynamic and responsive to changes in
          the network.</dd>
          <dt>Flexibility:</dt>
          <dd>A TE system should allow for changes in optimization policy.  In
          particular, a TE system should provide sufficient configuration
          options so that a network administrator can tailor the system to a
          particular environment.  It may also be desirable to have both
          online and offline TE subsystems that can be independently enabled
          and disabled.  TE systems that are used in multi-class networks
          should also have options to support class-based performance
          evaluation and optimization.</dd>
          <dt>Interoperability:</dt>
          <dd>Whenever feasible, TE systems and their components should be
          developed with open standards-based interfaces to allow
          interoperation with other systems and components.</dd>
          <dt>Scalability:</dt>
          <dd>Public networks continue to grow rapidly with respect to
          network size and traffic volume.  Therefore, to remain applicable as
          the network evolves, a TE system should be scalable.  In particular,
          a TE system should remain functional as the network expands with
          regard to the number of routers and links and with respect to the
          number of flows and the traffic volume.  A TE system should have a
          scalable architecture, should not adversely impair other functions
          and processes in a network element, and should not consume too many
          network resources when collecting and distributing state
          information or when exerting control.</dd>
          <dt>Security:</dt>
          <dd>Security is a critical consideration in TE systems.  Such
          systems typically exert control over functional aspects of the
          network to achieve the desired performance objectives.  Therefore,
          adequate measures must be taken to safeguard the integrity of the TE
          system.  Adequate measures must also be taken to protect the network
          from vulnerabilities that originate from security breaches and other
          impairments within the TE system.</dd>
          <dt>Simplicity:</dt>
          <dd>A TE system should be as simple as possible.  Simplicity in
          user interface does not necessarily imply that the TE system will
          use naive algorithms.  When complex algorithms and internal
          structures are used, the user interface should hide such
          complexities from the network administrator as much as
          possible.</dd>
          <dt>Stability:</dt>
          <dd>Stability refers to the resistance of the network to oscillate
          (flap) in a disruptive manner from one state to another, which may
          result in traffic being routed first one way and then another
          without satisfactory resolution of the underlying TE issues and
          with continued changes that do not settle down.  Stability is a very
          important consideration in TE systems that respond to changes in the
          state of the network.  State-dependent TE methodologies typically
          include a trade-off between responsiveness and stability.  It is
          strongly recommended that when a trade-off between responsiveness
          and stability is needed, it should be made in favor of stability
          (especially in public IP backbone networks).</dd>
          <dt>Usability:</dt>
          <dd>Usability is a human aspect of TE systems.  It refers to the
          ease with which a TE system can be deployed and operated.  In
          general, it is desirable to have a TE system that can be readily
          deployed in an existing network.  It is also desirable to have a TE
          system that is easy to operate and maintain.</dd>
          <dt>Visibility:</dt>
          <dd>Mechanisms should exist as part of the TE system to collect
          statistics from the network and to analyze these statistics to
          determine how well the network is functioning.  Derived statistics
          (such as traffic matrices, link utilization, latency, packet loss,
          and other performance measures of interest) that are determined from
          network measurements can be used as indicators of prevailing network
          conditions.  The capabilities of the various components of the
          routing system are other examples of status information that should
          be observable.</dd>

        <name>Routing Recommendations</name>
        <t>Routing control is a significant aspect of Internet traffic
       engineering.  Routing impacts many of the key performance measures
       associated with networks, such as throughput, delay, and utilization.
       Generally, it is very difficult to provide good service quality in a
       wide area network without effective routing control.  A desirable TE
       routing system is one that takes traffic characteristics and network
       constraints into account during route selection while maintaining
       stability.</t>
        <t>Shortest Path First (SPF) IGPs are based on shortest path
        algorithms and have limited control capabilities for TE <xref
        target="RFC2702" format="default"/> <xref target="AWD2"
        format="default"/>.  These limitations include:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	  <li><t>Pure SPF protocols do not take network constraints and
	  traffic characteristics into account during route selection.  For
	  example, IGPs always select the shortest paths based on link metrics
	  assigned by administrators, so load sharing cannot be performed
	  across paths of different costs.  Note that link metrics are
	  assigned following a range of operator-selected policies that might
	  reflect preference for the use of some links over others; therefore,
	  "shortest" might not be purely a measure of distance.  Using
	  shortest paths to forward traffic may cause the following
	  problems:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>If traffic from a source to a destination exceeds the
              capacity of a link along the shortest path, the link (and hence
              the shortest path) becomes congested while a longer path between
              these two nodes may be under-utilized.</li>
              <li>The shortest paths from different sources can overlap at
              some links.  If the total traffic from the sources exceeds the
              capacity of any of these links, congestion will occur.</li>
              <li>Problems can also occur because traffic demand changes over
              time, but network topology and routing configuration cannot be
              changed as rapidly.  This causes the network topology and
              routing configuration to become sub-optimal over time, which may
              result in persistent congestion problems.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) capability of SPF IGPs supports
          sharing of traffic among equal-cost paths.  However, ECMP attempts
          to divide the traffic as equally as possible among the equal-cost
          shortest paths.  Generally, ECMP does not support configurable
          load-sharing ratios among equal-cost paths.  The result is that one
          of the paths may carry significantly more traffic than other paths
          because it may also carry traffic from other sources.  This
          situation can result in congestion along the path that carries more
          traffic.  Weighted ECMP (WECMP) (see, for example, <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-unequal-lb" format="default"/>) provides
          some mitigation.</li>
          <li>Modifying IGP metrics to control traffic routing tends to have
          network-wide effects.  Consequently, undesirable and unanticipated
          traffic shifts can be triggered as a result.  Work described in
          <xref target="PRACTICE" format="default"/> may be capable of better
          control <xref target="FT00" format="default"/> <xref target="FT01"
          format="default"/>.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Because of these limitations, capabilities are needed to enhance
        the routing function in IP networks.  Some of these capabilities are
        summarized below:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Constraint-based routing computes routes to fulfill requirements
          subject to constraints.  This can be useful in public IP backbones
          with complex topologies.  Constraints may include bandwidth, hop
          count, delay, and administrative policy instruments, such as resource
          class attributes <xref target="RFC2702" format="default"/> <xref
          target="RFC2386" format="default"/>.  This makes it possible to
          select routes that satisfy a given set of requirements.  Routes
          computed by constraint-based routing are not necessarily the
          shortest paths.  Constraint-based routing works best with
          path-oriented technologies that support explicit routing, such as
          MPLS.</li>
          <li>Constraint-based routing can also be used as a way to distribute
          traffic onto the infrastructure, including for best-effort traffic.
          For example, congestion problems caused by uneven traffic
          distribution may be avoided or reduced by knowing the reservable
          bandwidth attributes of the network links and by specifying the
          bandwidth requirements for path selection.</li>
          <li>A number of enhancements to the link-state IGPs allow them to
          distribute additional state information required for
          constraint-based routing.  The extensions to OSPF are described in
          <xref target="RFC3630" format="default"/>, and the extensions to
          IS-IS are described in <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/>.
          Some of the additional topology state information includes link
          attributes, such as reservable bandwidth and link resource class
          attribute (an administratively specified property of the link).  The
          resource class attribute concept is defined in <xref
          target="RFC2702" format="default"/>.  The additional topology state
          information is carried in new TLVs and sub-TLVs in IS-IS <xref
          target="RFC5305" format="default"/> or in the Opaque LSA in OSPF
          <xref target="RFC3630" format="default"/>.</li>

          <li>An enhanced link-state IGP may flood information more frequently
          than a normal IGP.  This is because even without changes in
          topology, changes in reservable bandwidth or link affinity can
          trigger the enhanced IGP to initiate flooding.  A trade-off between
          the timeliness of the information flooded and the flooding frequency
          is typically implemented using a threshold based on the percentage
          change of the advertised resources to avoid excessive consumption of
          link bandwidth and computational resources and to avoid instability
          in the TED.</li>
          <li>In a TE system, it is also desirable for the routing subsystem
          to make the load-splitting ratio among multiple paths (with equal
          cost or different cost) configurable.  This capability gives network
          administrators more flexibility in the control of traffic
          distribution across the network.  It can be very useful for
          avoiding/relieving congestion in certain situations.  Examples can
          be found in <xref target="XIAO" format="default"/> and <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-unequal-lb" format="default"/>.</li>
          <li>The routing system should also have the capability to control
          the routes of subsets of traffic without affecting the routes of
          other traffic if sufficient resources exist for this purpose.  This
          capability allows a more refined control over the distribution of
          traffic across the network.  For example, the ability to move
          traffic away from its original path to another path (without
          affecting other traffic paths) allows the traffic to be moved from
          resource-poor network segments to resource-rich segments.
          Path-oriented technologies, such as MPLS-TE, inherently support this
          capability as discussed in <xref target="AWD2"
          format="default"/>.</li>
          <li>Additionally, the routing subsystem should be able to select
          different paths for different classes of traffic (or for different
          traffic behavior aggregates) if the network supports multiple
          classes of service (different behavior aggregates).</li>

        <name>Traffic Mapping Recommendations</name>
        <t>Traffic mapping is the assignment of traffic workload onto
        (pre-established) paths to meet certain requirements.  Thus, while
        constraint-based routing deals with path selection, traffic mapping
        deals with the assignment of traffic to established paths that may
        have been generated by constraint-based routing or by some other
        means.  Traffic mapping can be performed by time-dependent or
        state-dependent mechanisms, as described in <xref target="TIME"
        format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>Two important aspects of the traffic mapping function are the
        ability to establish multiple paths between an originating node and a
        destination node and the capability to distribute the traffic across
        those paths according to configured policies.  A precondition for this
        scheme is the existence of flexible mechanisms to partition traffic
        and then assign the traffic partitions onto the parallel paths
        (described as "parallel traffic trunks" in <xref target="RFC2702"
        format="default"/>).  When traffic is assigned to multiple parallel
        paths, it is recommended that special care should be taken to ensure
        proper ordering of packets belonging to the same application (or
        traffic flow) at the destination node of the parallel paths.</t>
        <t>Mechanisms that perform the traffic mapping functions should aim to
        map the traffic onto the network infrastructure to minimize
        congestion.  If the total traffic load cannot be accommodated, or if
        the routing and mapping functions cannot react fast enough to changing
        traffic conditions, then a traffic mapping system may use short
        timescale congestion control mechanisms (such as queue management,
        scheduling, etc.) to mitigate congestion.  Thus, mechanisms that
        perform the traffic mapping functions complement existing congestion
        control mechanisms.  In an operational network, traffic should be
        mapped onto the infrastructure such that intra-class and inter-class
        resource contention are minimized (see <xref target="BG"
        format="default"/>).</t>
        <t>When traffic mapping techniques that depend on dynamic state
        feedback (e.g., MPLS Adaptive Traffic Engineering (MATE) <xref target="MATE" format="default"/> and
        suchlike) are used, special care must be taken to guarantee network
        stability.</t>

        <name>Measurement Recommendations</name>
        <t>The importance of measurement in TE has been discussed throughout
        this document.  A TE system should include mechanisms to measure and
        collect statistics from the network to support the TE function.
        Additional capabilities may be needed to help in the analysis of the
        statistics.  The actions of these mechanisms should not adversely
        affect the accuracy and integrity of the statistics collected.  The
        mechanisms for statistical data acquisition should also be able to
        scale as the network evolves.</t>
        <t>Traffic statistics may be classified according to long-term or
        short-term timescales.  Long-term traffic statistics are very useful
        for traffic engineering.  Long-term traffic statistics may
        periodically record network workload (such as hourly, daily, and
        weekly variations in traffic profiles) as well as traffic trends.
        Aspects of the traffic statistics may also describe class of service
        characteristics for a network supporting multiple classes of service.
        Analysis of the long-term traffic statistics may yield other
        information such as busy-hour characteristics, traffic growth
        patterns, persistent congestion problems, hotspots, and imbalances in
        link utilization caused by routing anomalies.</t>

        and short-term traffic statistics should be in place.  In
        multi-service IP networks, the traffic matrices may be constructed for
        different service classes.  Each element of a traffic matrix
        represents a statistic about the traffic flow between a pair of
        abstract nodes.  An abstract node may represent a router, a collection
        of routers, or a site in a VPN.</t>
        <t>Traffic statistics should provide reasonable and reliable
        indicators of the current state of the network on the short-term
        scale.  Some short-term traffic statistics may reflect link
        utilization and link congestion status.  Examples of congestion
        indicators include excessive packet delay, packet loss, and high
        resource utilization.  Examples of mechanisms for distributing this
        kind of information include SNMP, probing tools, FTP, IGP link-state
        advertisements, NETCONF/RESTCONF, etc.</t>

        <t>The recommendations in Sections <xref target="ROUTEREC" format="counter"/>
        and <xref target="MAPREC" format="counter"/> may be sub-optimal or
        even ineffective if the amount of traffic flowing on a route or path
        exceeds the capacity of the resource on that route or path.  Several
        approaches can be used to increase the performance of TE systems:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The fundamental approach is some form of planning where traffic
          is steered onto paths so that it is distributed across the available
          resources.  This planning may be centralized or distributed and
          must be aware of the planned traffic volumes and available
          resources.  However, this approach is only of value if the traffic
          that is presented conforms to the planned traffic volumes.</li>
          <li>Traffic flows may be policed at the edges of a network.  This is
          a simple way to ensure that the actual traffic volumes are
          consistent with the planned volumes.  Some form of measurement (see
          <xref target="MSRREC" format="default"/>) is used to determine the
          rate of arrival of traffic, and excess traffic could be discarded.
          Alternatively, excess traffic could be forwarded as best-effort
          within the network.  However, this approach is only completely
          effective if the planning is stringent and network-wide and if a
          harsh approach is taken to disposing of excess traffic.</li>
          <li>Resource-based admission control is the process whereby network
          nodes decide whether to grant access to resources.  The basis for
          the decision on a packet-by-packet basis is the determination of the
          flow to which the packet belongs.  This information is combined with
          policy instructions that have been locally configured or
          installed through the management or control planes.  The end result
          is that a packet may be allowed to access (or use) specific
          resources on the node if, and only if, the flow to which the packet
          belongs conforms to the policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Combining some elements of all three of these measures is advisable
        to achieve a better TE system.</t>

        <name>Network Survivability</name>
        <t>Network survivability refers to the capability of a network to
        maintain service continuity in the presence of faults.  This can be
        accomplished by promptly recovering from network impairments and
        maintaining the required QoS for existing services after recovery.
        Survivability is an issue of great concern within the Internet
        community due to the demand to carry mission-critical traffic,
        real-time traffic, and other high-priority traffic over the Internet.
        Survivability can be addressed at the device level by developing
        network elements that are more reliable and at the network
        level by incorporating redundancy into the architecture, design, and
        operation of networks.  It is recommended that a philosophy of
        robustness and survivability should be adopted in the architecture,
        design, and operation of TE used to control IP networks (especially
        public IP networks).  Because different contexts may demand different
        levels of survivability, the mechanisms developed to support network
        survivability should be flexible so that they can be tailored to
        different needs.  
A number of tools and techniques have been developed
        to enable network survivability, including MPLS Fast Reroute <xref
        target="RFC4090" format="default"/>, Topology Independent Loop-free
        Alternate Fast Reroute for Segment Routing <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa" format="default"/>, 
        RSVP-TE Extensions in Support of End-to-End GMPLS Recovery <xref
        target="RFC4872" format="default"/>, and GMPLS Segment Recovery <xref
        target="RFC4873" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The impact of service outages varies significantly for different
        service classes depending on the duration of the outage, which can vary
        from milliseconds (with minor service impact) to seconds (with
        possible call drops for IP telephony and session timeouts for
        connection-oriented transactions) to minutes and hours (with
        potentially considerable social and business impact).  Outages of
        different durations have different impacts depending on the nature of
        the traffic flows that are interrupted.</t>
        <t>Failure protection and restoration capabilities are available in
        multiple layers as network technologies have continued to evolve.
        Optical networks are capable of providing dynamic ring and mesh
        restoration functionality at the wavelength level.  At the SONET/SDH
        layer, survivability capability is provided with Automatic Protection
        Switching (APS) as well as self-healing ring and mesh architectures.
        Similar functionality is provided by Layer 2 technologies such as
        Ethernet.</t>
        <t>Rerouting is used at the IP layer to restore service following link
        and node outages.  Rerouting at the IP layer occurs after a period of
        routing convergence, which may require seconds to minutes to complete.
        Path-oriented technologies such as MPLS <xref target="RFC3469"
        format="default"/> can be used to enhance the survivability of IP
        networks in a potentially cost-effective manner.</t>
        <t>An important aspect of multi-layer survivability is that
        technologies at different layers may provide protection and
        restoration capabilities at different granularities in terms of
        timescales and at different bandwidth granularities (from the level of
        packets to that of wavelengths).  Protection and restoration
        capabilities can also be sensitive to different service classes and
        different network utility models.  Coordinating different protection
        and restoration capabilities across multiple layers in a cohesive
        manner to ensure network survivability is maintained at reasonable
        cost is a challenging task.  Protection and restoration coordination
        across layers may not always be feasible, because networks at different
        layers may belong to different administrative domains.</t>
        <t>Some of the general
        recommendations for protection and restoration coordination are as follows:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Protection and restoration capabilities from different layers
          should be coordinated to provide network survivability in a flexible
          and cost-effective manner.  Avoiding duplication of functions in
          different layers is one way to achieve the coordination.  Escalation
          of alarms and other fault indicators from lower to higher layers may
          also be performed in a coordinated manner.  The order of timing of
          restoration triggers from different layers is another way to
          coordinate multi-layer protection/restoration.</li>
          <li>Network capacity reserved in one layer to provide protection and
          restoration is not available to carry traffic in a higher layer: it
          is not visible as spare capacity in the higher layer.  Placing
          protection/restoration functions in many layers may increase
          redundancy and robustness, but it can result in significant
          inefficiencies in network resource utilization.  Careful planning is
          needed to balance the trade-off between the desire for survivability
          and the optimal use of resources.</li>
          <li>It is generally desirable to have protection and restoration
          schemes that are intrinsically bandwidth efficient.</li>
          <li>Failure notifications throughout the network should be timely
          and reliable if they are to be acted on as triggers for effective
          protection and restoration actions.</li>
          <li>Alarms and other fault monitoring and reporting capabilities
          should be provided at the right network layers so that the
          protection and restoration actions can be taken in those
          layers.</li>

          <name>Survivability in MPLS-Based Networks</name>
          <t>Because MPLS is path-oriented, it has the potential to provide
          faster and more predictable protection and restoration capabilities
          than conventional hop-by-hop routed IP systems.  Protection types
          for MPLS networks can be divided into four categories:</t>
<dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
            <dt>Link Protection:</dt><dd>
	    The objective of link protection is to protect an LSP from the
	    failure of a given link.  Under link protection, a protection or
	    backup LSP (the secondary LSP) follows a path that is disjoint
	    from the path of the working or operational LSP (the primary LSP)
	    at the particular link where link protection is required.  When
	    the protected link fails, traffic on the working LSP is switched
	    to the protection LSP at the headend of the failed link.  As a
	    local repair method, link protection can be fast.  This form of
	    protection may be most appropriate in situations where some
	    network elements along a given path are known to be less reliable
	    than others.</dd>
            <dt>Node Protection:</dt><dd>
	    The objective of node protection is to protect an LSP from the
	    failure of a given node.  Under node protection, the secondary LSP
	    follows a path that is disjoint from the path of the primary LSP
	    at the particular node where node protection is required.  The
	    secondary LSP is also disjoint from the primary LSP at all links
	    attached to the node to be protected.  When the protected node
	    fails, traffic on the working LSP is switched over to the
	    protection LSP at the upstream LSR directly connected to the
	    failed node.  Node protection covers a slightly larger part of the
	    network compared to link protection but is otherwise
	    fundamentally the same.</dd>
            <dt>Path Protection:</dt><dd>
	    The goal of LSP path protection (or end-to-end protection) is
	    to protect an LSP from any failure along its routed path.  Under
	    path protection, the path of the protection LSP is completely
	    disjoint from the path of the working LSP.  The advantage of path
	    protection is that the backup LSP protects the working LSP from
	    all possible link and node failures along the path, except for
	    failures of ingress or egress LSR.  Additionally, path protection
	    may be more efficient in terms of resource usage than link or node
	    protection applied at every hop along the path.  However, path
	    protection may be slower than link and node protection because the
	    fault notifications have to be propagated further.</dd>
            <dt>Segment Protection:</dt><dd>
	    An MPLS domain may be partitioned into multiple subdomains
	    (protection domains).  Path protection is applied to the path of
	    each LSP as it crosses the domain from its ingress to the domain
	    to where it egresses the domain.  In cases where an LSP traverses
	    multiple protection domains, a protection mechanism within a
	    domain only needs to protect the segment of the LSP that lies
	    within the domain.  Segment protection will generally be faster
	    than end-to-end path protection because recovery generally occurs
	    closer to the fault, and the notification doesn't have to propagate
	    as far.</dd>

          protection LSPs used to protect n working LSPs.  In all cases
          except 1+1 protection, the resources associated with the protection

            <dt>1:n protection:</dt>
	    <dd>One protection LSP is used to protect/restore n working LSPs.
	    Traffic is sent only on the n protected working LSPs until the

            <dt>1+1 protection:</dt>

	    on local policy (usually based on traffic integrity).  When a
	    fault disrupts the traffic on one LSP, the egress switches to
	    receive traffic from the other LSP.  This approach is expensive in

        <t>Networks are often implemented as layers.  A layer relationship may
        represent the interaction between technologies (for example, an IP
        network operated over an optical network) or the relationship between
        different network operators (for example, a customer network operated
        over a service provider's network).  Note that a multi-layer network
        does not imply the use of multiple technologies, although some form of
        encapsulation is often applied.</t>
        <t>Multi-layer traffic engineering presents a number of challenges
        associated with scalability and confidentiality.  These issues are

        <name>Traffic Engineering in Diffserv Environments</name>
        <t>Increasing requirements to support multiple classes of traffic in
        the Internet, such as best-effort and mission-critical data, call for
        IP networks to differentiate traffic according to some criteria and to
        give preferential treatment to certain types of traffic.  Large
        numbers of flows can be aggregated into a few behavior aggregates
        based on some criteria based on common performance requirements in
        terms of packet loss ratio, delay, and jitter or in terms of common
        fields within the IP packet headers.</t>
        <t>Differentiated Services (Diffserv) <xref target="RFC2475"
        format="default"/> can be used to ensure that SLAs defined to
        differentiate between traffic flows are met.  Classes of service can
        be supported in a Diffserv environment by concatenating Per-Hop
        Behaviors (PHBs) along the routing path.  A PHB is the forwarding
        behavior that a packet receives at a Diffserv-compliant node, and it
        can be configured at each router.  PHBs are delivered using
        buffer-management and packet-scheduling mechanisms and require that
        the ingress nodes use traffic classification, marking, policing, and
        shaping.</t>
        <t>TE can complement Diffserv to improve utilization of network
        resources.  TE can be operated on an aggregated basis across all
        service classes <xref target="RFC3270" format="default"/> or on a
        per-service-class basis.  The former is used to provide better
        distribution of the traffic load over the network resources (see <xref
        target="RFC3270" format="default"/> for detailed mechanisms to support
        aggregate TE).  The latter case is discussed below since it is
        specific to the Diffserv environment, with so-called Diffserv-aware
        traffic engineering <xref target="RFC4124" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>For some Diffserv networks, it may be desirable to control the
        performance of some service classes by enforcing relationships between
        the traffic workload contributed by each service class and the amount
        of network resources allocated or provisioned for that service class.
        Such relationships between demand and resource allocation can be
        enforced using a combination of, for example:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>TE mechanisms on a per-service-class basis that enforce the
          relationship between the amount of traffic contributed by a given
          service class and the resources allocated to that class.</li>
          <li>Mechanisms that dynamically adjust the resources allocated to a
          given service class to relate to the amount of traffic contributed
          by that service class.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>It may also be desirable to limit the performance impact of
        high-priority traffic on relatively low-priority traffic.  This can be
        achieved, for example, by controlling the percentage of high-priority
        traffic that is routed through a given link.  Another way to
        accomplish this is to increase link capacities appropriately so that
        lower-priority traffic can still enjoy adequate service quality.  When
        the ratio of traffic workload contributed by different service classes
        varies significantly from router to router, it may not be enough to
        rely on conventional IGP routing protocols or on TE mechanisms that
        are not sensitive to different service classes.  Instead, it may be
        desirable to perform TE, especially routing control and mapping
        functions, on a per-service-class basis.  One way to accomplish this
        in a domain that supports both MPLS and Diffserv is to define
        class-specific LSPs and to map traffic from each class onto one or
        more LSPs that correspond to that service class.  An LSP corresponding
        to a given service class can then be routed and protected/restored in
        a class-dependent manner, according to specific policies.</t>
        <t>Performing TE on a per-class basis may require per-class parameters
        to be distributed.  It is common to have some classes share some
        aggregate constraints (e.g., maximum bandwidth requirement) without
        enforcing the constraint on each individual class.  These classes can
        be grouped into class types, and per-class-type parameters can be
        distributed to improve scalability.  This also allows better bandwidth
        sharing between classes in the same class type.  A class type is a set
        of classes that satisfy the following two conditions:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Classes in the same class type have common aggregate
          requirements to satisfy required performance levels.</li>
          <li>There is no requirement to be enforced at the level of an
          individual class in the class type.  Note that it is, nevertheless,
          still possible to implement some priority policies for classes in
          the same class type to permit preferential access to the class type
          bandwidth through the use of preemption priorities.</li>

        <t>Offline and online (see <xref target="OFFON" format="default"/>) TE
        considerations are of limited utility if the network cannot be
        controlled effectively to implement the results of TE decisions and to

        <t>Capacity augmentation is a coarse-grained solution to TE issues.
        However, it is simple, may be applied through creating parallel links
        that form part of an ECMP scheme, and may be advantageous if bandwidth
        is abundant and cheap.  However, bandwidth is not always abundant and
        cheap, and additional capacity might not always be the best solution.
        Adjustments of administrative weights and other parameters associated
        with routing protocols provide finer-grained control, but this
        approach is difficult to use and imprecise because of the way the
        routing protocols interact across the network.</t>
        <t>Control mechanisms can be manual (e.g., static configuration),
        partially automated (e.g., scripts), or fully automated (e.g.,
        policy-based management systems).  Automated mechanisms are
        particularly useful in large-scale networks.  Multi-vendor
        interoperability can be facilitated by standardized management tools
        (e.g., YANG models) to support the control functions required to
        address TE objectives.</t>

	process, which selects the preferred exit points out of an AS toward specific
	destination networks by taking a number of different considerations into
	account.  The BGP path selection process can be influenced by
	manipulating the attributes associated with the process, including
	NEXT_HOP, LOCAL_PREF, AS_PATH, ORIGIN, MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED), IGP
	metric, etc.</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>Most BGP implementations provide constructs that facilitate the
      implementation of complex BGP policies based on pre-configured logical
      conditions. These can be used to control import and export of
      incoming and outgoing routes, control redistribution of routes
      between BGP and other protocols, and influence the selection of best
      paths by manipulating the attributes (either standardized or local to
      the implementation) associated with the BGP decision process.</t>
      <t>When considering inter-domain TE with BGP, note that the outbound
      traffic exit point is controllable, whereas the interconnection point
      where inbound traffic is received typically is not.  Therefore, it is up
      to each individual network to implement TE strategies that deal with the
      efficient delivery of outbound traffic from its customers to its peering
      points.  The vast majority of TE policy is based on a "closest exit"
      strategy, which offloads inter-domain traffic at the nearest outbound
      peering point towards the destination AS.  Most methods of manipulating
      the point at which inbound traffic enters are either ineffective or
      not accepted in the peering community.</t>
      <t>Inter-domain TE with BGP is generally effective, but it is usually
      applied in a trial-and-error fashion because a TE system usually only
      has a view of the available network resources within one domain (an AS
      in this case).  A systematic approach for inter-domain TE requires
      cooperation between the domains.  Further, what may be considered a good
      solution in one domain may not necessarily be a good solution in
      another.  Moreover, it is generally considered inadvisable for one
      domain to permit a control process from another domain to influence the
      routing and management of traffic in its network.</t>
      <t>MPLS-TE tunnels (LSPs) can add a degree of flexibility in the
      selection of exit points for inter-domain routing by applying the
      concept of relative and absolute metrics.  If BGP attributes are defined
      such that the BGP decision process depends on IGP metrics to select exit
      points for inter-domain traffic, then some inter-domain traffic destined
      to a given peer network can be made to prefer a specific exit point by
      establishing a TE tunnel between the router making the selection and the
      peering point via a TE tunnel and assigning the TE tunnel a metric
      that is smaller than the IGP cost to all other peering points.  RSVP-TE
      protocol extensions for inter-domain MPLS and GMPLS are described in
      <xref target="RFC5151" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Similarly to intra-domain TE, inter-domain TE is best accomplished
      when a traffic matrix can be derived to depict the volume of traffic
      from one AS to another.</t>
      <t>Layer 4 multipath transport protocols are designed to move traffic
      between domains and to allow some influence over the selection of the
      paths.  To be truly effective, these protocols would require visibility
      of paths and network conditions in other domains, but that
      information may not be available, might not be complete, and is not
      necessarily trustworthy.</t>

      <name>Overview of Contemporary TE Practices in Operational IP Networks</name>
      <t>This section provides an overview of some TE practices in IP
      networks.  The focus is on aspects of control of the routing function in
      operational contexts.  The intent here is to provide an overview of the
      commonly used practices; the discussion is not intended to be
      exhaustive.</t>
      <t>Service providers apply many of the TE mechanisms described in this
      document to optimize the performance of their IP networks, although
      others choose to not use any of them.  These techniques include capacity
      planning, including adding ECMP options, for long timescales; routing
      control using IGP metrics and MPLS, as well as path planning and path
      control using MPLS and SR for medium timescales; and
      traffic management mechanisms for short timescales.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Capacity planning is an important component of how a service
        provider plans an effective IP network.  These plans may take the
        following aspects into account: location of any new links or nodes,
        WECMP algorithms, existing and predicted traffic patterns, costs, link
        capacity, topology, routing design, and survivability.</li>
        <li>Performance optimization of operational networks is usually an
        ongoing process in which traffic statistics, performance parameters,
        and fault indicators are continually collected from the network.  This
        empirical data is analyzed and used to trigger TE mechanisms.  Tools
        that perform what-if analysis can also be used to assist the TE
        process by reviewing scenarios before a new set of configurations are
        implemented in the operational network.</li>
        <li>Real-time intra-domain TE using the IGP is done by increasing the
        OSPF or IS-IS metric of a congested link until enough traffic has been
        diverted away from that link.  This approach has some limitations as
        discussed in <xref target="ROUTEREC" format="default"/>.  Intra-domain
        TE approaches <xref target="RR94" format="default"/> <xref
        target="FT00" format="default"/> <xref target="FT01"
        format="default"/> <xref target="WANG" format="default"/> take
        traffic matrix, network topology, and network performance objectives
        as input and produce link metrics and load-sharing ratios.  These
        processes open the possibility for intra-domain TE with IGP to be done
        in a more systematic way.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>Administrators of MPLS-TE networks specify and configure link
      attributes and resource constraints such as maximum reservable bandwidth
      and resource class attributes for the links in the domain.  A link-state
      IGP that supports TE extensions (IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) is used to
      propagate information about network topology and link attributes to all
      routers in the domain.  Network administrators specify the LSPs that are
      to originate at each router.  For each LSP, the network administrator
      specifies the destination node and the attributes of the LSP that
      indicate the requirements that are to be satisfied during the path
      selection process.  The attributes may include an explicit path for the
      LSP to follow, or the originating router may use a local
      constraint-based routing process to compute the path of the LSP.
      RSVP-TE is used as a signaling protocol to instantiate the LSPs.  By
      assigning proper bandwidth values to links and LSPs, congestion caused
      by uneven traffic distribution can be avoided or mitigated.</t>
      <t>The bandwidth attributes of an LSP relate to the bandwidth
      requirements of traffic that flows through the LSP.  The traffic
      attribute of an LSP can be modified to accommodate persistent shifts in
      demand (traffic growth or reduction).  If network congestion occurs due
      to unexpected events, existing LSPs can be rerouted to alleviate the
      situation, or the network administrator can configure new LSPs to divert
      some traffic to alternative paths.  The reservable bandwidth of the
      congested links can also be reduced to force some LSPs to be rerouted to
      other paths.  A traffic matrix in an MPLS domain can also be estimated
      by monitoring the traffic on LSPs.  Such traffic statistics can be used
      for a variety of purposes including network planning and network
      optimization.</t>
      <t>Network management and planning systems have evolved and assumed a
      lot of the responsibility for determining traffic paths in TE networks.
      This allows a network-wide view of resources and facilitates
      coordination of the use of resources for all traffic flows in the
      network.  Initial solutions using a PCE to perform path computation on
      behalf of network routers have given way to an approach that follows the
      SDN architecture.  A stateful PCE is able to track all of the LSPs in
      the network and can redistribute them to make better use of the
      available resources.  Such a PCE can form part of a network orchestrator
      that uses PCEP or some other configuration and management interface to
      instruct the signaling protocol or directly program the routers.</t>
      <t>SR leverages a centralized TE controller and either an
      MPLS or IPv6 forwarding plane but does not need to use a signaling
      protocol or management plane protocol to reserve resources in the
      routers.  All resource reservation is logical within the controller and
      is not distributed to the routers.  Packets are steered through the
      network using SR, and this may have configuration and
      operational scaling benefits.</t>
      <t>As mentioned in <xref target="INTER" format="default"/>, there is
      usually no direct control over the distribution of inbound traffic to a
      domain.  Therefore, the main goal of inter-domain TE is to optimize the
      distribution of outbound traffic between multiple inter-domain links.
      When operating a geographically widespread network (such as for a
      multi-national or global network provider), maintaining the ability to
      operate the network in a regional fashion where desired, while
      continuing to take advantage of the benefits of a globally
      interconnected network, also becomes an important objective.</t>

      <t>Inter-domain TE with BGP begins with the placement of multiple
      peering interconnection points that are in close proximity to traffic
      sources/destinations and offer lowest-cost paths across the network
      between the peering points and the sources/destinations.  Some
      location-decision problems that arise in association with inter-domain
      routing are discussed in <xref target="AWD5" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Once the locations of the peering interconnects have been determined
      and implemented, the network operator decides how best to handle the
      routes advertised by the peer, as well as how to propagate the peer's
      routes within their network.  One way to engineer outbound traffic flows
      in a network with many peering interconnects is to create a hierarchy of
      peers.  Generally, the shortest AS paths will be chosen to forward
      traffic, but BGP metrics can be used to prefer some peers and so favor
      particular paths.  Preferred peers are those peers attached through
      peering interconnects with the most available capacity.  Changes may be
      needed, for example, to deal with a "problem peer" who is difficult to
      work with on upgrades or is charging high prices for connectivity to
      their network.  In that case, the peer may be given a reduced
      preference.  This type of change can affect a large amount of traffic
      and is only used after other methods have failed to provide the desired
      results.</t>
      <t>When there are multiple exit points toward a given peer, and only one
      of them is congested, it is not necessary to shift traffic away from the
      peer entirely, but only from the one congested connection. This can be
      achieved by using passive IGP metrics, AS_PATH filtering, or prefix
      filtering.</t>

    <section anchor="SECURE" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>In general, TE mechanisms are security neutral, and this document
      does not introduce new security issues.</t>
      <t>Network security is, of course, an important issue, and TE mechanisms
      can have benefits and drawbacks:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>TE may use tunnels that can slightly help protect traffic from
        inspection and that, in some cases, can be secured using
        encryption.</li>
        <li>TE puts traffic onto predictable paths within the network that may
        make it easier to find and attack.</li>
        <li>TE often increases the complexity of operation and management of
        the network, which may lead to errors that compromise security.</li>
        <li>TE enables traffic to be steered onto more secure links or
        to more secure parts of the network.</li>
        <li>TE can be used to steer traffic through network nodes that are
        able to provide additional security functions.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The consequences of attacks on the control and management protocols
      used to operate TE networks can be significant:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
      <li>Traffic can be hijacked
      to pass through specific nodes that perform inspection or even to be
      delivered to the wrong place.</li>
      <li>Traffic can be steered onto paths that
      deliver quality that is below the desired quality.</li>
      <li>Networks can be
      congested or have resources on key links consumed.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Thus, it is
      important to use adequate protection mechanisms, such as authentication,
      on all protocols used to deliver TE.</t>
      <t>Certain aspects of a network may be deduced from the details of the
      TE paths that are used.  For example, the link connectivity of the
      network and the quality and load on individual links may be inferred
      from knowing the paths of traffic and the requirements they place on the
      network (for example, by seeing the control messages or through
      path-trace techniques).  Such knowledge can be used to launch targeted
      attacks (for example, taking down critical links) or can reveal
      commercially sensitive information (for example, whether a network is
      close to capacity).  Therefore, network operators may choose techniques
      that mask or hide information from within the network.</t>
      <t>External control interfaces that are introduced to provide additional
      control and management of TE systems (see <xref target="TEapproach"
      format="default"/>) provide flexibility to management and to customers,
      but they do so at the risk of exposing the internals of a network to
      potentially malicious actors.  The protocols used at these interfaces
      must be secured to protect against snooping and modification, and use of
      the interfaces must be authenticated.</t>

      <name>Summary of Changes since RFC 3272</name>
      <t>The changes to this document since <xref target="RFC3272"
      format="default"/> are substantial and not easily summarized as
      section-by-section changes.  The material in the document has been moved
      around considerably, some of it removed, and new text added.</t>
      <t>The approach taken here is to list the contents of both <xref target="RFC3272"
      format="default"/>
      and this document saying, respectively, where the text has
      been placed and where the text came from.</t>
