    <abstract>
<t>This document describes LEX, a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace identifier 
that identifies, names, assigns, and manages persistent resources in the 
legal domain.  This specification allows adoption of a common
convention by multiple jurisdictions to facilitate ease of reference and
access to resources in the legal domain.</t>
<t>This specification is an Independent
Submission to the RFC Series. It is not a standard and does not have the
consensus of the IETF.</t>

        <name>The Purpose of Namespace LEX</name>
        <t>The purpose of the LEX namespace is to assign a unique identifier
        in a well-defined format to documents that are sources of law.  
In this context, "sources of law" include any legal document within the domain
of legislation, case law, administrative acts, or regulations. Potential
sources of law (acts under the process of law formation, such as bills) are
included as well. "Legal doctrine", that is, the body of knowledge and
theoretical speculation typical of legal scholars (e.g., commentary on
judgment, jurisprudence review, commentary on legislation, encyclopedic
entries, monographs, articles in magazines, manuals, etc.) is explicitly not
covered.</t>
        <t>The identifier is conceived so that its construction depends only on
the content of the document itself and not its online availability, physical location, and access mode. The identifier itself is assigned
by the jurisdiction of the identified document.  A document that
is not available online may, nevertheless, have a LEX URN identifier.</t>
        <t>The LEX URN may be used as a way to represent references (and
more generally, any type of relation) among various sources of law.
In an online environment with resources distributed among different
web publishers, LEX URNs
allow a simplified global interconnection of legal documents by means
of automated resolution. 
LEX URNs consist of persistent and 
location-independent identifiers and are particularly
useful when they can be mapped into or associated with locators such
as HTTP URLs. Moreover, LEX URN details can be used as a reference
to create persistent and location-independent identifiers that are HTTP-based
<xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="background">
        <name>Background</name>
        <t>This specification of a unique identifier for legal documents
follows a number of initiatives in the field of legal document
management.</t>

<t>Since 2001, the Italian Government promoted the NormeInRete project
        through the National Center for Information Technology in the Public
        Administration, the Ministry of Justice, and the National Research
        Council of Italy (CNR). The NormeInRete project was aimed at introducing standards for describing and identifying sources
        of law using XML and URN
        techniques.</t>
        <t>Other national initiatives in Europe introduced standards for the
description of legal sources <xref target="FRAN"/>.  Collaborations
between government, national research institutes, and
universities have defined national XML standards for legal document
management, as well as schemes for legal document identification.
Outside of Europe, similar initiatives have addressed similar problems
<xref target="FRAN"/>.  
	Several of these identifiers are based on a URN schema.</t>
	<t>In today's information society, the processes of political, social, and 
economic integration of European Union (EU) Member States, as well as the 
increasing integration of the worldwide legal and economic processes, 
are causing a growing interest in the exchange of legal information 
at national and transnational levels.
The growing desire for improved quality and accessibility of legal
information amplifies the need for interoperability among legal
information systems across national boundaries. A common, well-defined
schema used to identify sources of law at an international level is an
essential prerequisite for interoperability.</t>
        <t>Interest groups within several countries have already expressed
        their intention to adopt a shared solution based on a URN technique.
	In several conferences (such as <xref target="LVI"/>), representatives
	of the Publications Office of the European Union (OP) have expressed
	the need for a unique identifier for sources of law,
	based on open standards and able to provide advanced
	modalities of document hyperlinking, with the aim of promoting
	interoperability among national and European institution information
	systems.

Similar concerns have been raised by
        international groups concerned with free access to legal information,
        and the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private
        International Law <xref target="HCPIL"/> encourages State Parties
        to "adopt neutral methods of citation of their legal materials,
        including methods that are medium-neutral, provider-neutral and
        internationally consistent". 
In a similar direction, the CEN Metalex
        initiative is moving, at the European level, towards the definition of a
        standard interchange format for sources of law, including
        recommendations for defining naming conventions for them.</t>
        <t>Additionally, the need for unique identifiers for sources of law is of
particular interest in the domain of case law. 
This need is acutely felt within both common law systems (where cases are 
the main law sources) and civil law systems, because unique identifiers can provide 
integrated access to cases and legislation, as well as the ability to track the 
relationships between them. This domain is characterized
by a high degree of fragmentation in case law information systems,
which usually lack interoperability.</t>
        <t>In the European Union, the community institutions have stressed the
need for citizens, businesses, lawyers, prosecutors, and judges to
become more aware of (directly applicable) EU laws and also
the various national legal systems. 
The growing importance of
national judiciaries for the application of community law was
stressed in the resolution of the European Parliament of 9 July 2008
on the role of the national judge in the European judicial system.
Similarly, the Council of the European Union has underlined the 
importance of cross-border access to national case law, as well as 
the need for its standardization, with a vision of a decentralized 
architecture with integrated access. The Working Party on Legal Data 
Processing (e-Law) of the Council of the European Union formed a 
task group to study the possibilities for improving cross-border 
access to national case law. 
Taking notice of the report of the
Working Party's task group, in 2009, the Council of the European Union decided to
elaborate on a uniform European system for the identification of
case law (i.e., the European Case-Law Identifier (ECLI)) and a uniform set of metadata based on the Dublin Core.</t>
        <t>The Council of the European Union invited the Member States to
        introduce the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) in the legal
        information systems, which is an HTTP-based, Semantic Web-oriented
        identification system for legislation of the European Union and Member States.</t>
        <t>The LEX identifier (also referred to in this text as "LEX name") is
conceived to be general enough to provide guidance at the core
of the standard and offer sufficient flexibility to cover a wide variety of
needs for identifying legal documents of different types,
namely, legislative, case law, and administrative acts. 

Moreover, it
can be effectively used within a federative environment where
different publishers (public and private) can provide their own items, 
in <xref target="FRBR"/> sense (see <xref target="src-law"/>),
of a legal document (that is, there is more than one manifestation (see <xref target="src-law"/>) of 
the same legal document).</t>
        <t>Specifications and syntax rules for the LEX identifier can also be used
for HTTP-based naming conventions to cope with
different requirements in legal information management, for example,
the need to have an identifier that is compliant with the Linked Open Data
principles.</t>
        <t>This document supplements the required name syntax with a naming
convention that interprets all these recommendations into an original
solution for sources of law identification.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="general-characteristics-of-the-system">
        <name>General Characteristics of the System</name>
        <t>The specifications in this document promote interoperability
among legal information systems by defining a namespace
convention and structure that will create and manage identifiers for
legal documents. The identifiers are intended to have the following qualities:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>globally unique</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>transparent</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>reversible</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>persistent</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>location-independent</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>language-neutral</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>These qualities facilitate management of legal documents and
a mechanism for stable cross-collection and cross-country
references.</t>
<t>Transparency means that, for a given act and its relevant metadata
(issuing authority, type of measure, etc.), it is possible to create
a related URN that is able to
uniquely identify the act in a way that is reversible
(from an act to its URN and from a
URN to the act).</t>
        <t>Language neutrality, in particular, is an important feature that
promotes adoption of the standard by organizations that must adhere to
official language requirements. This specification provides
guidance to both public and private groups that create, promulgate,
and publish legal documents. Registrants wish to minimize the
potential for creating conflicting proprietary schemes, while
preserving sufficient flexibility to allow for diverse document types
and to respect the need for local control of collections by an
equally diverse assortment of administrative entities.</t>
        <t>The challenge is to provide the right amount guidance at the
core of the specification while providing sufficient flexibility to
cover a wide variety of needs. LEX does this by
splitting the identifier into parts.  The first part uses a
preexisting standard specification ("country/jurisdiction name
standard") to indicate the country (or more generally, the
jurisdiction) of origin for the legal document being identified; the
remainder ("local-name") is intended for local use in identifying
documents issued in that country or jurisdiction.</t>
        <t>The second part depends only on the identification
        system for sources of law operating in that nation, and it is mainly composed by
        formalized information related to the enacting authority, the type of
        measure, the details, and possibly the annex.</t>
        <t>The identification system based on uniform names includes:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>A schema for assigning names capable of unambiguously
            representing any addressed source of law (namely legislation, case
            law, and administrative acts) issued by any authority
            (intergovernmental, supranational, national, regional, and local)
            at any time (past, present, and future).</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A resolution mechanism -- in a distributed environment -- that ties a
uniform name to the online location of the corresponding
resource(s).</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>This document considers the first of these requirements. It also
contains a few references to the architecture of the resolution
service and to the corresponding software.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="linking-a-lex-name-to-a-document">
        <name>Linking a LEX Name to a Document</name>
        <t>The LEX name is linked to the document through metadata, which
may be specified as follows:</t>
<ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Within the document itself through a specific element within
an XML schema or by a meta tag <xref target="W3C.HTML"/>.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Externally by means of a Resource Description Framework <xref target="W3C.RDF-SCHEMA"/>
triple, a specific attribute in a database, etc.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>At least one of these references is necessary to enable automated
construction, an update of catalogues (distributed and centralized),
and the implementation of resolvers that associate the uniform name
of a document with its physical location. LEX assumes no
particular relationship between the originator of the document, its
publisher, the implementer of catalogues, or resolution services.</t>

      <section anchor="use-of-lex-names-in-references">
        <name>Use of LEX Names in References</name>
        <t>LEX names can be used in references as an HREF attribute value of the
hypertext link to the referred document.
This link can be created in two ways:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
<t>Manually inserting the link with the                                                   
uniform name in the referring document. This is a burdensome procedure, especially for
documents that are already online.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Automatically constructing (either permanently or temporarily)
the link with the uniform name from references in the text using
a parser. This procedure offers more time savings, even if it is subject to a
certain percentage of errors, since references are not always
accurate or complete. This solution could nevertheless be
acceptable for documents that are already published.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <t>No matter which method is adopted, new documents produced
in a certain format (for example, XML, XHTML, etc.) 
should express references through the uniform name
of the document referred to.</t>

<dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
            <dt>jurisdiction-code:</dt><dd><t>Usually the identification code of the
            country where the source of law is issued.  To facilitate the
            transparency of the name, the jurisdiction-code usually follows
            the rules of identification of other Internet applications, based
            on domain name (for details and special cases, see <xref
            target="jur-cod-regist"/>).</t>
	    <t>Due to the differences in representation in the various

	    strongly <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> for easier identification
	    of the country.  Therefore, a LEX URN ID always begins with a
	    sequence of ASCII characters: "urn:lex:ccTLD". For all the other
	    components that follow the jurisdiction-code, the Jurisdictional
	    Registrar decides the mode of representation (ASCII or UTF-8
	    percent-encoding; see <xref target="non-ascii-char"/>).</t>
<t>Where applicable, the domain name of the country or multinational or
international organization is used.  If such information is not available for

be present in each jurisdiction. 
Therefore, the jurisdiction-unit differs for acts of the same type issued by similar authorities but pertain to different jurisdictions related to different geographical areas. An example can be the following:</t>
<ul empty="true" spacing="compact">

authoritativeness and the offered guarantees.  The designated
expert(s) will evaluate such applications with a similar approach as
evaluations of the DNS. Typically, such applications should come from public
administrations, as authorities enacting sources of law.</t>
        <t>The adopted registration policy is similar to that of the "Expert Review"
policy specified in <xref target="RFC8126"/>. The designated expert(s) will assign
jurisdiction-codes based on the following principles:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>If a request comes from a jurisdiction that corresponds to a
country and the jurisdiction-code is the same as a top-level Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD),
then the top-level ccTLD should be
used as the jurisdiction-code.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>If a request comes from a jurisdiction that corresponds to a
            multi-national organization (e.g., European Union) or international organization (e.g.,
            United Nations and World Trade Organization), the
            Top-Level Domain Name (e.g., "eu") or the Domain Name (e.g.,
            "un.org" and "wto.org") of the organization should be used as the
            jurisdiction-code.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>If a multi-national or international organization does
not have a registered domain, the designated expert(s) should assign
something like "name.lex.arpa", where the name will be the 
acronym of the organization name in the language chosen by the organization itself.
For example, the jurisdiction-code of the European Economic Community
could be "eec.lex.arpa". The alias mechanism allows for acronyms in different languages.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <t>Jurisdiction-codes <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be renamed, because that
would violate the rule that URN assignments be persistent.</t>
        <t>Jurisdiction-codes <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> ever be deleted. They can only be marked as
"obsolete", i.e., closed for new assignments within the jurisdiction.
Requests to obsolete a jurisdiction-code are also processed by
the designated expert(s).</t>
        <t>Designated expert(s) can unilaterally initiate allocation or
obsolescence of a jurisdiction-code.</t>
        <t>Requests for new jurisdiction-code assignments must include
the organization or country requesting it and contact information (email)
of who requested the assignment.</t>

        <t>For all the languages where different cases (uppercase or lowercase)
        or different spellings of the same word are possible, names belonging
        to LEX namespace are case-insensitive.  For the Latin alphabet, it is
        <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that names be created in
        lower case, but names that differ only in case or in the spelling of
        the same word <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be considered equivalent
        (e.g., "Ministry" will be recorded as "ministry").</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="non-ascii-char">
        <name>Unicode Characters Outside the ASCII Range</name>

        <t>In order to exploit the DNS as a routing tool towards the proper
resolution system, keep editing and communication more simple, and avoid character percent-encoding, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that characters outside the ASCII range 
(e.g., national characters, diacritic signs, etc.) are turned into base ASCII
characters (e.g., the Italian term "sanità" (sanitU+00E0)" replaced into
"sanita", the French term "ministère" (ministU+00E8re) replaced into
"ministere", in case by transliteration (e.g., "München" (MU+00FCnchen)
replaced into "muenchen").</t>
        <t>This mapping consists of:</t>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Transcription from non-Latin alphabets</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Transliteration of some signs (e.g., diaeresis and eszett)</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Preservation of only the basic characters, eliminating the signs
placed above (e.g., accents and tilde), below (e.g., cedilla and little tail), or on (e.g., oblique cut)</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
<t>The most suitable, well-known, and widespread mapping system for a given
language <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be chosen by the jurisdiction or by the
jurisdiction-unit (in agreement with the jurisdiction) in the case of
different languages in various regions, also taking into account the choices
made for the same language by other jurisdictions.  This mapping is simpler
and more feasible for languages that use the Latin alphabet and gradually
becomes more complex for other alphabets and for writing systems that use
opposite orientation (from right to left) or are based on ideographic
symbols.</t>
        <t>If this conversion is not acceptable by a specific jurisdiction or
        it is not available in a given language, Unicode <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        be used, and for accessing network protocols, any Unicode code points
        outside the ASCII range <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be converted to UTF-8
        percent-encoding according to <xref target="RFC3986"/> and <xref
        target="RFC3629"/> .</t>

<t>In this case, it should be noted that the
        generated URN (as well as some of its parts) cannot be used directly for
        routing through the DNS. Therefore, the jurisdiction must adopt one of
        the following strategies:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Convert non-ASCII characters within the DNS into IDN
encoding using Punycode translation <xref target="RFC5894"/> (e.g.,
"münchen" (mU+00FCnchen) in xn--mnchen-3ya) and develop a
software interface that converts the URN before the navigation in the DNS.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Create a routing service relying on a software, outside of the DNS,
that addresses a proper resolution service.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Note that the LEX URN ID could contain groups of characters (UTF-8 percent-encoded) 
of some languages with different orientations. In this case, the BiDi rules apply <xref target="RFC5893"/>.</t>
        <t>The preferred order is summarized as follows:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Conversion into basic ASCII is the <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> solution (because
      conversions for network protocols and the DNS are not needed).</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Using Unicode and converting to UTF-8 percent-encoding <xref target="RFC3629"/> for accessing network protocols 
and to Punycode <xref target="RFC5894"/> only for navigation in DNS via software interface.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Creation of a routing service relying on a software outside of DNS
and addressing a proper resolution service.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The first solution allows native DNS routing while the other two
solutions require software development for the interface or the routing.
However, it is up to the specific jurisdiction to choose the preferred
solution.</t>

solutions adopted:</t>

        <t><xref target="ISO.8601-1.2019"/> and <xref target="ISO.8601-2.2019"/> describe the international format for representing dates. Dates <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always be represented in this format (4 digits for the year, 
2 digits for the month, and 2 digits for the day):</t>
        <sourcecode type="abnf">
    date-iso = year "-" month "-" day
        </sourcecode>
        <t>For example, "September 2, 99" will be written as "1999-09-02".</t>
        <t>This format ensures interoperability between different
        representation systems and there are several programs for mapping
        other formats to this one.  However, to make reading and understanding
        such other formats (e.g., Jewish calendar), the LEX URN scheme
        provides that the date can be added in the jurisdiction's own format.
        The date in the previous example (1999-09-02) would be as follows:</t>

	    <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>

        <t>Therefore, for all the dates in the LEX URN identifier 
(see Sections <xref target="det-elem" format="counter"/> and <xref target="ide-vers" format="counter"/>),
it is possible to indicate the date in the local format:</t>
        <sourcecode type="abnf">
    date = date-iso ["|" date-loc]
        </sourcecode>
<t>For example, 1999-09-02 will be written in<br/> 
ISO plus Hebrew format as:
<tt>1999-09-02|כ״א-בֶּאֱלוּל-תשנ״ט</tt>
which is to be converted into UTF-8 for network protocols and for resolution (see <xref target="non-ascii-char"/>). The characters that are not allowed (e.g., "/") or reserved (e.g., ",") cannot exist 
inside the date-loc and therefore <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be turned into ".". To be aligned with ISO format, any blank between day, month, and year <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be converted into "-".</t>

<t>In the above Hebrew character examples, the sequence of characters<br/>
is <u>כ</u>, <u>״</u>, <u>א</u>, <u>-</u>, <u>בֶּ</u>, <u>אֱ</u>, <u>ל</u>, <u>וּ</u>, <u>ל</u>, <u>-</u>, <u>ת</u>, <u>ש</u>, <u>נ</u>, <u>״</u>, and <u>ט</u>.</t>

        <name>Model of Sources of Law Representation</name>
        <t>According to the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records
        (FRBR) <xref target="FRBR"/> model developed by IFLA (International
        Federation of Library Associations and Institutions), four
        fundamental entities (or aspects) can be specified in a source of law,
        as in any intellectual production.</t>
        <t>The first two entities reflect its contents:</t>
        <dl spacing="normal">

            <dt>work:</dt><dd>Identifies a distinct intellectual creation; in this document, it
identifies a source of law in both its original form and its amended 
form over time.</dd>
            <dt>expression:</dt><dd>Identifies a specific intellectual realization of a
work; in this document, it identifies every different (original or
up-to-date) version of the source of law over time and/or language in
which the text is expressed.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>The other two entities relate to its form:</t>
        <dl spacing="normal">
            <dt>manifestation:</dt><dd>Identifies a physical embodiment of an expression of a work;
in this document, it identifies embodiments in different media
(printing, digital, etc.), encoding formats (XML, PDF, etc.),
or other publishing characteristics.</dd>
            <dt>item:</dt><dd>Identifies a specific copy of a manifestation; in this document, it
identifies individual physical copies as they are found in
particular physical locations.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>In this document, the <xref target="FRBR"/> model has been interpreted for the
specific characteristics of the legal domain. In particular, apart
from the language that does produce a specific expression, the
discriminative criterion between expression and manifestation is
based on the difference of the juridical effects that a variation can
provide with respect to the involved actors (citizens, parties,
and institutions). In this scenario, the main characteristic of the
expression of an act is represented by its validity over the time
during which it provides the same juridical effects. These effects may
change as a result of amendments or annulments of other legislative or
jurisprudential acts. Therefore, notes, summaries, comments,
anonymizations, and other editorial activities over the same text do
not produce different expressions. Instead, they produce different manifestations.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="the-structure-of-the-local-name">
        <name>Structure of the Local-Name</name>
        <t>The local-name within the LEX namespace <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain all the
necessary pieces of information enabling the unequivocal
identification of a legal document.  If the local-name violates
this requirement, the related URN is not a valid one within the LEX
namespace.</t>
        <t>In the legal domain, three components are always
present at the "work" level: the enacting authority, the measure type, and the
details. A fourth component, the annex, is added if any.
It is often necessary to differentiate various expressions, that is:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>the original version and all the amended versions of the same

            <t>the versions of the text expressed in the different official
languages of the state or organization.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Finally, the uniform name allows a distinction among diverse
manifestations that may be produced by multiple publishers using
different means and formats.</t>
        <t>In every case, the basic identifier of the source of law (work)
remains the same, but information is added regarding the specific
version under consideration (expression). Similarly, a suffix is added
to the expression for representing the characteristics of the
publication (manifestation).</t>
        <t>Information that forms a uniform name for a source of law at each level
(work, expression, and manifestation) is expressed in the official
language of the relevant jurisdiction. More language-dependent names (aliases) are                                         
created in cases where there are multiple official                                                                          
languages (as in Switzerland) or more involved jurisdictions (as in                                          
international treaties).</t>

        <t>Therefore, the more general structure of the local-name appears as
follows:</t>
        <sourcecode type="abnf">
       local-name = work ["@" expression] ["$" manifestation]
        </sourcecode>
        <t>However, consistent with legislative practice, the uniform name of
the main original provision (work) becomes the identifier of an
entire class of documents that includes the following: the original main document,
the annexes, and all the versions, languages, and formats
that are subsequently generated.</t>

        <name>Structure of the Document Identifier at "Work" Level</name>
        <t>The structure of the document identifier is comprised of the four
fundamental elements mentioned above, distinguished one from
the other and ordered by increasingly narrow
domains and competencies:</t>
        <sourcecode type="abnf">
   work = authority ":" measure ":" details *(":" annex)

(e.g., state, ministry, municipality, court, etc.).</dd>

            <dt>measure:</dt><dd>The type of the measure, both public (e.g.,
constitution, act, treaty, regulation, decree, decision, etc.) and
private (e.g., license, agreement, etc.).</dd>

            <dt>details:</dt><dd>The terms associated with the measure, typically the date

of the act.</dd>

            <dt>annex:</dt><dd>The identifier of the annex, if any (e.g., Annex 1).</dd>

        </dl>
<t>Both the main document and its annexes have their
own uniform names so that they can be referenced individually; the
identifier of the annex adds a suffix to that of the main document.
   In a similar way, the identifier of an annex of an annex adds an ending
   to that of the annex that it is attached to.
</t>
        <t>The main elements of the work name are generally divided into several
elementary components, and for each component, specific rules of
representation are established (criteria, modalities, syntax, and
order).

        <t>The type of measure is important to identify
case law and legislation, especially within legal systems
where cases are traditionally identified only through the year of
release and a number. Since the aim of the LEX schema is to
identify specific materials, the type of measure or the full date are
able to differentiate between materials belonging to a
specific case.</t>

        <t>International treaties involve multiple signatory jurisdictions
and are therefore represented through multiple identifiers, each of them related
to a signatory. For example, a bilateral France and
Germany treaty is identified through two URNs (aliases) belonging to
either the "fr" or "de" jurisdiction
(e.g., "urn:lex:fr:etat:traite:..." and "urn:lex:de:staat:vertrag:..."
since it pertains to both the French and German jurisdictions).</t>
        <t>In the states or organizations that have multiple official
languages, a document has multiple identifiers. Each identifier is expressed in
a different official language and is basically a set of equivalent aliases.
This system permits manual or automated construction of the uniform
name of the referred source of law in the same language used in the
document itself
(e.g., "urn:lex:eu:council:directive:2004-12-07;31" and
"urn:lex:eu:consiglio:direttiva:2004-12-07;31").</t>
        <t>Moreover, a document can be assigned more than one uniform name in
order to facilitate its linking from other documents. This option can
be used for documents that, although unique, are commonly referenced
from different perspectives, for example, the form of a document's
promulgation and its specific content (e.g., a Regulation promulgated 
through a Decree of the President of the Republic).</t>

</ul>
        <t>It is useful to be able to assign a uniform name to a
manifestation (or to a part of it) in case non-textual objects are
involved. These may be multimedia objects that are non-textual in
their own right (e.g., geographic maps, photographs, etc.) or texts
recorded in non-textual formats (e.g., image scans of documents).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sources-of-law-references">
        <name>Sources of Law References</name>
        <t>References to sources of law often refer to specific partitions of
the act (article, paragraph, etc.) and not to the entire document.</t>
        <t>From a legal point of view, a partition is always a text block that
represents a logical subdivision of an act.</t>
        <t>In the digital representation, a partition is represented
        by an element (a block of text) with its own ID; this ID aims to
        identify the related element and locate it. Therefore, 
        it is possible to either extract or point to a
        partition.</t>

        <t>For markup that does not fit the logical structure of the text (like HTML),
generally only the starting point of the partition, rather than the
whole block of text or element, is identified through a label (e.g., &lt;a
id=partitionID&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tag in the HTML markup language <xref target="W3C.HTML"/>). In this case, it is only possible to point to a partition but not extract it.</t>

        <t>Partitions should be assigned unique labels or
IDs within the including document, and their value should be the same
regardless of document format.</t>
        <t>To enable the construction of the partition identifier between
        different collections of documents, specific construction rules for
        IDs or labels will be defined and shared within each country or
        jurisdiction for any document type. For example, in legislation, paragraph 2 of 
        article 3 might have the value "art3;par2" as the label or ID;
        similarly, for case law, paragraph 22 of the judgment in
        Case 46/76 Bauhuis v Netherlands might have the value "par22" as the label or ID.</t>
        <t>Furthermore, it is useful to foresee the compatibility with
applications that are able to manage this information (e.g., returning the
proper element); these procedures are particularly useful in the case
of rather long acts, such as codes, constitutions, regulations, etc.
For this purpose, it is necessary that the partition identifier be
transmitted to the servers (resolution and application). Therefore,
it cannot be separated by the typical "#" character of URI fragment,
which is not transmitted to the server.</t>
        <t>According to these requirements, the syntax of a reference is:</t>
        <sourcecode type="abnf">
     URN-reference = URN-document ["~" partition-id]
        </sourcecode>
        <t>For example, referring to paragraph 3 of article 15 of the French
Act of 15 May 2004, n. 106, the reference can be
"urn:lex:fr:etat:loi:2004-05-15;106~art15;par3".</t>
<t>If a different separator ("~") is used after the document name, the
   partition ID is not withheld by the browser but is transmitted to
   the resolution process. 
If the
partition syntax is compatible with the media type used, this enables the resolver to retrieve (for
example, out of a database) only the referred partition; otherwise, the whole act is returned. 
	</t>
        <t>When resolving to HTTP,
the resolver <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> transform the partition ID 
to an appropriate internal reference (#) on the page 
or at the beginning if that point cannot be found.
The transformation in the URI fragment is obtained by appending the "#" character followed by the partition ID to
the URL (in the
example above, the returned URL will be &lt;URL-document&gt;#art15;par3).
Doing this, knowing the granularity of the act markup, the resolver
could exploit the hierarchical structure of the ID by eliminating 
sub-partitions that are not addressed. In the previous example, if only the article was identified in the
act, it could return &lt;URL-document&gt;#art15
only.</t>
        <t>It is possible to use the general syntax (with "#"); in this
case, only the URN document component of the reference is transmitted
to the resolver; therefore, the whole document will always be 
retrieved.</t>

          <name>Aliases for Sources of Law with Different Normative References</name>
          <t>There are legislative measures that, although unique, are usually
          cited in different ways, for example, introducing them into the
          legal order through a legislative act (President's decree,
          legislative decree, etc.) or through their legislative category
          (regulations, consolidation, etc.).  In order to ensure the validity of the references in all cases, an alias (an additional URN LEX
          identifier) that takes into account the measure category is added
          to what represents the legislative form of the same act (e.g.,
          "state:decree.legislative:1992-07-24;358" and
          "state:consolidation;public.contracts:1992-07-24;358").</t>

          <name>Relations Between Measure and Authority in the Aliases</name>

          <t>The sources of law including different normative references are
usually introduced in legislation through the adoption or the issuing
of an act, which they are either included or attached to. Therefore, it is
 necessary to create an alias linking the two aspects of
the same document. Specifically, the different measures can be:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>Adopted/issued by an authority different from the one regulated by
the provision (e.g., the statute of a Body). In this case, the
correlation is established between two uniform names, each featuring
a completely different authority element
(e.g., "italian.society.authors.publishers:statute" and
"ministry.cultural.activities+ministry.finances.budget.economic.
planning:decree").</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Issued by the institution itself either because it has issuing
authority or by virtue of a proxy (e.g., a provision that refers to
the functioning of the Body itself). In this case, the two aliases
share the first part of the authority
(e.g., "municipality.firenze:statute" and
"municipality.firenze;council:deliberation").</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Issued by the same Body to regulate a particular sector of its own
competence. In this case, the authority element is the same
(e.g., "ministry.justice:regulation;use.information.tools.
telematic.process" and "ministry.justice:decree").</t>

          <name>Indication of the Details</name>
          <t>The details of a source of law usually include the date of the
enactment and the identification number (inclusion in the body of
laws, registry, protocol, etc.).</t>
          <t>Some measures can have multiple dates. There are also cases in which
the number of the measure does not exist (unnumbered measures) or a
measure has multiple numbers (e.g., unified cases). For these
reasons, the setup of both elements (date and number) includes
multiple values.</t>
          <t>Some institutions (e.g., the Parliaments) usually identify documents
through their period of reference (e.g., the legislature number)
rather than through a date, which would be much less meaningful and
never used in references (e.g., Senate bill S.2544 of the XIV
legislature). In these cases, the component period is
substituted for the component dates.</t>
          <t>Usually, details of a measure are not reported according to a specific
sequence. In accordance with the global structure of the uniform
name, which goes from general to specific, the sequence 
date-number has the following form:</t>
          <sourcecode type="abnf">
   details = (dates / period) ";" numbers
        </sourcecode>
          <t>The following are examples: "2000-12-06;126" and "14.legislature;s.2544".</t>

<t>For example, the measure of the Data Protection Authority of

          <t>Measures not officially numbered in the publications may have a
non-unequivocal identifier, because several measures of the same type
can exist and can be issued on the same day by the same authority.
To ensure that the uniform name is unambiguous, the numbers field
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>, in any case, contain a discriminating element, which can be any
identifier used internally and not published by the authority
(e.g., protocol).</t>
          <t>If the authority does not have its own identifier, one identifier
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be created for the name system. In order to easily differentiate
it, such number is preceded by the string "lex-":</t>
          <sourcecode type="abnf">
   number-lex = "lex-" 1*DIGIT
        </sourcecode>
          <t>The following is an example: "ministry.finances:decree:1999-12-20;lex-3".</t>
          <t>It is the responsibility of the authority issuing a document to assign a
discriminating specification to it. When there are multiple authorities,
only one of them is responsible for the assignment of the number to
the document (e.g., the proponent).</t>
          <t>The unnumbered measures published on an official publication (e.g.,
the Official Gazette), are
recognized by the univocal identifying label printed on the paper instead of by a progressive number.
Such an identifier, even if it is unofficial but assigned to a document in
an official publication, is preferred because it has the clear
advantage of being public and is therefore easier to find.</t>

        <section anchor="mult-num">
          <name>Multiple Numbers</name>
          <t>Some legal documents (e.g., bills), even if unique, are identified by
a set of numbers (e.g., the unification of cases or bills).
In this case, in the numbers field, all the identifiers are
reported, according to the following structure:</t>

          <t>The characters that are not allowed (e.g., "/") or reserved (e.g.,
":"), including the comma, cannot exist inside the document-id and
therefore <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be turned into "-".</t>

<t>When special characters contained in the number of the act are
distinctive of the act itself (e.g., bill n. 123-bis (removal of 123)
and n. 123/bis (return of 123)) and would disappear with the
conversion to "-", a further ending must be added to
distinguish the acts (e.g., bill n.123-bis-removal and 123-bis-return).</t>

          <t>In order to identify the different time versions of the same act, a specific suffix has to be added to 
the uniform name of the original document.</t>
          <t>Such a suffix identifies each version of a legal provision and
includes, first and foremost, one of the following elements:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>The issuing date of the last amending measure taken into account.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The date that the communication of the rectification or
errata corrige was published.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>A specification that must identify the reason concerning the

for the cases in which the date is not usually used (e.g., bills).</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>It is possible to add further specifications that will
distinguish each of the different versions of the text to guarantee
identifier unequivocalness. Examples include changes of the 
in-force or effectiveness of a formal partition or portion of the text 
itself (e.g., when the amendments introduced by an act are applied at 
different times) or different events occurring on the same date.</t>
          <sourcecode type="abnf">
   version = (amendment-date / specification)
             *(";" (event-date / event))
        </sourcecode>
          <t>where:</t>
<dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
              <dt>amendment-date:</dt><dd>Contains the issuing date of the last considered
amendment or of the last communication of amendment. If the
original text introduces differentiated periods in which an act is
effective and the information system produces one version for each
of them, such element contains the string "original" expressed in
the language of the act or version.</dd>

              <dt>specification:</dt><dd>Contains any information that is useful to identify the version unambiguously
and univocally.</dd>

force, is effective, or is published.</dd>

              <dt>event:</dt><dd>A name assigned to the event producing a further version
(e.g., amendment, decision, etc.).</dd>

          </dl>
          <t>The issuing date of an amending act was chosen as the identifier of a
version because it can be obtained from the heading (formal data). For example, the name "state:royal.decree:1941-01-30;12@1998-02-19"
identifies the updated text of the "Royal Decree of 30/1/1941, No.
12" with the amendments introduced by the "Law Decree of 19/2/1998,
No. 51" without any indication of its actual entry into force.
The same uniform name with the additional ending ";1999-01-01" indicates
the in-force or effective version starting on a different date (1/1/99).</t>
<t>For full compatibility, every update of text, or of the 
effectiveness, of a "multi-version" document implies the creation of a 
new uniform name, even if the object remains single, containing the 
identifier of the virtually generated version, as in the case 
of a "single-version" document. 
Specific metadata will associate
every uniform name with the period of time during which such a name,
together with its corresponding text, is to be considered valid
(e.g., the "multi-version" document containing "R.D. of 01/30/1941,
no. 12", updated by the amendments introduced by the "D.Lgs. of
02/19/1998, no. 51", contains the name of the original version
"state:royal.decree:1941-01-30;12" as well as the name of the updated
version "state:royal.decree:1941-01-30;12@1998-02-19").</t>
          <t>Note that if there are attachments or annexes, the creation of a
new version (even in the case of only one component) would imply the
creation of a new uniform name for all the connected objects in order
to guarantee their alignment (i.e., the main document,
attachments, and annexes).</t>
          <t>As specified in <xref target="dat-form"/>, all the dates can have the date typical of the jurisdiction in addition to the date in ISO format.</t>

the source of law of that country or jurisdiction. 
This code is

        <name>Jurisdictional Registrar for Names Assignment</name>
        <t>Any country or jurisdiction that intends to adopt this schema <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
identify a Jurisdictional Registrar, an organization that shares and
defines the structure of the optional part (jurisdiction-unit) of
the name, according to the organization of the state or institution
(for details, see <xref target="jur-cod-regist"/>).  It must appoint a Jurisdictional 
Registrar and must apply the Designated Experts to register the new jurisdiction-code.</t>
<t>For example, in a federal state,
a jurisdiction-unit corresponding to the name of each Member State
(e.g., "br;sao.paulo", "br;minas.gerais", etc.) may be defined.</t>
        <t>The process of assigning the local-name is managed by each
specific country or jurisdiction under the related jurisdiction
element.</t>
        <t>In any country, the Jurisdictional Registrar shares and defines the
assignment of the primary elements (issuing authority and type of
legal measure) of the local-names considering the characteristics of
its own state or institution organization.</t>
        <t>The Jurisdictional Registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> establish, according to the guidelines
indicated in this document, a uniform procedure within the
country or organization to define local-name elements, make
decisions about normalizations, solve and avoid possible
name collisions, and maintain authoritative registries of
various kinds (e.g., for authorities, types of measures, etc.). In
particular, accurate point-in-time representations of the structure
and naming of government entities are important to semantically aware
applications in this domain.</t>
        <t>Moreover, the Jurisdictional Registrar shares and defines the rules to construct
partition IDs for each document type, possibly in accordance with
those already defined in other jurisdictions.</t>
        <t>Finally, the Jurisdictional Registrar will develop and publish the rules and
        guidelines for the local-name construction as well as the predefined
        values and codes. The Jurisdictional Registrar should also promote the LEX URN
        identifier for the sources of law of its jurisdiction.</t>
        <t>Such a set of rules will have to be followed by all institutional

constructed and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> update its registries and make them accessible.</t>
        <t>Any enacting authority is responsible for defining formal parameters to
guarantee local-name uniqueness by attributing, if necessary, a
conventional internal number, which when combined with the other local-name components (authority, measure, and date), builds a unique
identifier. Uniqueness is achieved by checking against the catalogue
of previously assigned names.</t>

      <section anchor="identifier-persistence-considerations">
        <name>Identifier Persistence Considerations</name>
        <t>The persistence of identifiers depends on the durability of the
institutions that assign and administer them. The goal of the LEX
schema is to maintain uniqueness and persistence of all resources
identified by the assigned URNs.</t>
        <t>In particular, CNR is responsible for maintaining
the uniqueness of the jurisdiction element. Given that the
jurisdiction is assigned on the basis of the long-held ccTLD
representation of the country (or the TLDN or DN of the organization)
and that the associated code for country or organization is expected to
continue indefinitely, the URN also persists indefinitely.</t>
        <t>The rules for the construction of the name are conceived to delegate
the responsibility of their uniqueness to a set of authorities that
is identified within each country or organization.</t>
        <t>Therefore, each authority is responsible for assigning URNs that
have a very long life expectancy and can be expected to remain unique
for the foreseeable future. Practical and political considerations,
as well as diverse local forms of government organization, will
result in different methods of assigning responsibility for different
levels of the name.</t>
        <t>Where this cannot be accomplished by the implementation of an
authoritative hierarchy, it is highly desirable that it be done by
creating consensus around a series of published rules for the
creation and administration of names by institutions and bodies that
operate by means of collaboration rather than compulsion.</t>
        <t>Issuing authorities that operate in more localized scopes, ranging
from national scope down to very local scope, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> equally take
responsibility for the persistence of identifiers within their scope.</t>

      <name>Recommendations for the Resolution Process</name>
      <section anchor="the-general-architecture-of-the-system">
        <name>General Architecture of the System</name>
        <t>The task of the resolution service is to associate a LEX
identifier with a specific document address on the Internet.  In
contrast with systems that can be constructed around rigorous and
enforceable engineering premises, such as DNS, the LEX namespace
resolver will be expected to cope with a wide variety of inputs
that are incomplete or partially incorrect, particularly those 
created by the automated extraction of
references from texts.  In this document,
the result is a particular emphasis on a flexible and robust resolver
design.</t>
        <t>The system has a distributed architecture based on two fundamental
components: a chain of information in the DNS and a
series of resolution services from URNs to URLs, each competent
within a specific domain of the namespace.</t>
        <t>The client retrieves the document associated with this URN using the
procedure described in <xref target="RFC3404"/>, which starts with a DNS NAPTR
query.</t>
        <t>A resolution service can delegate the resolution and management of
hierarchically dependent portions of the name.
Delegation of this responsibility will not be unreasonably withheld
provided that the processes for their resolution and management are
robust and followed.</t>
<t>For the LEX namespace, CNR will 1) maintain the root zone of the
chain resolution, equivalent to "lex.urn.arpa" (see <xref target="RFC3405"/>), in
the lex-nameserver.nic.it (see <xref target="iana"/>) and 2) update the DNS
information with a new record to delegate the relative resolution
when a new country (e.g., "br") or organization is added
(see <xref target="jur-cod-regist"/>). 
This delegation may be obtained by a regular
expression that matches the initial part of the URN (e.g.,
"urn:lex:br") and redirects towards the proper zone (e.g.,
"lex.senado.gov.br").</t>
        <t>Likewise, the institution responsible for the jurisdiction uniform
names (e.g., "urn:lex:br") has the task of managing the relative root
in the DNS system (e.g., "lex.senado.gov.br" zone) and routing the
resolution towards its resolvers on the basis of parts of the uniform
names. In a similar way, it can delegate the resolution of
country/organization sub-levels (e.g., "urn:lex:br;sao.paolo")
towards the relative zone (e.g., "lex.sao-paolo.gov.br").</t>
        <t>Such a DNS routing chain does not work for all the URN components
containing percent-encoded characters. Therefore, when converting a LEX URN
in UTF-8 code to a DNS query, clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform any necessary punycode
conversion <xref target="RFC5891"/> before sending the query.</t>
        <t>The resolution service is made up of two elements: a knowledge base
(consisting in a catalogue or a set of transformation rules) and 
software to query the knowledge base.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="catalogues-for-resolution">
        <name>Catalogues for Resolution</name>
        <t>Incompleteness and inaccuracy are rather frequent in legal citations;
thus, incomplete or inaccurate uniform names of the referred document
are likely to be built from textual references (this is even
more frequent if they are created automatically through a specific
parser). For this reason, the implementation of a catalogue, based on
a relational database, is suggested, as it will lead to higher
flexibility in the resolution process.</t>
        <t>In addition, the catalogue must manage the aliases, the various
versions and languages of the same source of law, and the
related manifestations.</t>
        <t>It is suggested that each enacting authority implement its own
catalogue, assigning a corresponding unambiguous uniform name to each
resource.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="suggested-resolver-behaviour">
        <name>Suggested Resolver Behavior</name>
        <t>First, the resolver <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> separate the part corresponding to
the partition ID from the document name, with the "~" separator.</t>
        <t>The resolution process <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> implement a normalization of the
uniform name to be resolved. This may involve transforming some
components to the canonical form (e.g., filling out the acronyms,
expanding the abbreviations, unifying the institution names,
standardizing the type of measures, etc.). For this function,
authorities and types of measure registries are useful.</t>
        <t>The resolver <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> then query the catalogue searching for the URN
that corresponds exactly to the given one (normalized if necessary).
Since the names coming from the references may be inaccurate or
incomplete, an iterative and heuristic approach (based on partial
matches) is indicated. Incomplete
references (not including all the elements to create the canonical
uniform name) are normal and natural; for a human reader, the
reference would be "completed" by contextual understanding of the
reference in the document in which it occurs.</t>

        <t>In this phase, the resolver should use the partition ID information
to retrieve, if it is possible, only the referred partition;
otherwise, the entire document is returned.</t>
        <t>Lacking more specific indications, the resolver <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> select the
best (most recent) version of the requested source of law and
provide all the manifestations with their related items.
A more specific indication in the uniform name to be resolved will,
of course, result in a more selective retrieval, based on any
suggested expression and/or manifestations components (e.g., date,
language, format, etc.).</t>
        <t>Finally, the resolver <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> append the "#" character
followed by the partition ID to URLs, to create URI fragments for
browser pointing.</t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="security-considerations">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Security considerations are those normally associated with the use and
resolution URNs in general. Additional security considerations concerning
the authenticity of a document do not pertain to the LEX specifications,
but they pertain to security and trust issues that can be addressed with other means,
like digital signatures, data encryption, etc.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="iana">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>IANA has registered LEX namespace in the
"Formal URN Namespaces" registry <xref target="RFC8141"/>.</t>
      <t>In addition, to activate a distributed resolution system, IANA has registered the following NAPTR record in the URN.ARPA domain:</t>
      <sourcecode type="dns-rr">
lex.urn.arpa.
    IN NAPTR  100  10  ""  ""  ""  lex-nameserver.nic.it.
        </sourcecode>
      <t>Note that lex-nameserver.nic.it indicates the CNR server (see <xref target="jur-cod-regist"/>)                  
that is responsible for the resolution of the LEX namespace at the time of this writing.</t>
