    <abstract>
      <t> Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms
      provide both confidentiality and integrity of data. The widespread use
      of AEAD algorithms in various applications has led to an increased
      demand for AEAD algorithms with additional properties, driving research
      in the field. This document provides definitions for the most common of
      those properties and aims to improve consistency in the terminology used
      in documentation. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum
      Research Group.

			<t>An Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm provides confidentiality for the plaintext to be encrypted and integrity for the plaintext and some associated data (sometimes called "Header"). AEAD algorithms play a crucial role in various applications and have emerged as a significant focus in cryptographic research.</t>
			<section anchor="IntBack" numbered="true" toc="default">
				<name>Background</name>
				 <t>
					AEAD algorithms are formally defined in <xref target="RFC5116" format="default"/>. The main benefit of AEAD algorithms is that they simultaneously provide data confidentiality and integrity and have a simple unified interface. In contrast to generic compositions of Message Authentication Code (MAC) and encryption algorithms, an AEAD algorithm allows for a reduction in key and state sizes, improving the data processing speed. Most AEAD algorithms come with security analysis, usage guidelines, and reference implementations. Consequently, their integration into high-level schemes and protocols is highly transparent. For instance, AEAD algorithms are mandatory in TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446" format="default" />, IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303" format="default" /> <xref target="RFC8221" format="default" />, and QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" />.
				</t>
				<t>
					While confidentiality and data integrity (the conventional properties of AEAD algorithms) suffice for many applications, some environments demand other uncommon cryptographic properties. These often require additional analysis and research. As the number of such properties and corresponding research papers grows, inevitable misunderstandings and confusion arise. This is a common situation when related but formally different properties are named identically or when some security properties only have folklore understanding and are not formally defined. Consequently, the risk of misusing AEAD algorithms increases, potentially resulting in security issues.

				<name>Scope</name>
				<t>
					In <xref target="Properties" format="default"/> of this document, we provide a list of the most common additional properties of AEAD algorithms. The properties are divided into two categories, namely, security properties (see <xref target="SecurityProp" format="default"/>) and implementation properties (see <xref target="ImpProp" format="default"/>).

					We provide a high-level definition for each property. For security properties, we also reference an informative source where a formal game-based security notion is defined; we do not consider security properties for which no game-based formalization exists. When possible, we offer additional information: synonymous names, examples of algorithms that provide the property, applications that might necessitate the property from an AEAD algorithm, references for further reading, and additional notes containing information outside these categories.
				</t>

				<t>
					The objective of this document is to enhance clarity and establish a common language in the field. In particular, the primary application of the document lies in the following two use cases within the document development process in the IRTF and IETF:
				</t>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<t>For an RFC or I-D that defines an AEAD algorithm, it is recommended to use the notations in <xref target="Properties" format="default"/> when listing additional properties of the algorithm.</t>
					</li>
					<li>
						<t>For an RFC or I-D that defines a generic protocol based on an AEAD algorithm, it is recommended to use the notations in <xref target="Properties" format="default"/> if any additional properties are required from the algorithm.</t>
					</li>
				</ul>

					This document represents the consensus of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG). This document is not an IETF product and is not a standard.

	  <t> This section gives a conventional definition of an AEAD
	  algorithm following <xref target="RFC5116" format="default"/>. </t>

	  <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
	    <dt>Definition:</dt>
	    <dd><t>An AEAD algorithm is defined by two operations, which are
	    authenticated encryption and authenticated decryption:</t>
	    <ul spacing="normal">
	      <li>A deterministic operation of authenticated encryption
	      has four inputs, each a binary string: a secret key K of a fixed
	      bit length, a nonce N, associated data A, and a plaintext P. The
	      plaintext contains the data to be encrypted and authenticated,
	      and the associated data contains the data to be authenticated
	      only. Each nonce value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique in every
	      distinct invocation of the operation for any particular value of
	      the key. The authenticated encryption operation outputs a
	      ciphertext C.</li>
	      <li>A deterministic operation of authenticated decryption has
	      four inputs, each a binary string: a secret key K of a fixed bit
	      length, a nonce N, associated data A, and a ciphertext C. The
	      operation verifies the integrity of the ciphertext and
	      associated data and decrypts the ciphertext. It returns a
	      special symbol FAIL if the inputs are not authentic; otherwise,
	      the operation returns a plaintext P.</li>
	    </ul>
	    </dd>
	  </dl>

	  <t>We note that specifications of AEAD algorithms that use authentication tags
     to ensure integrity may define the authentication tag as an
     independent output of the encryption operation and an independent input of
     the decryption operation. Throughout this document, by default, we consider
     the authentication tag as part of the ciphertext.
			</t>	
			<t>
				For more details on the AEAD definition, please refer to <xref target="RFC5116" format="default" />.
			</t>

			<t>
				Throughout this document, by default, we consider nonce-based AEAD algorithms, which have an interface as defined above, and we give no other restrictions on their structure. However, some properties considered in the document apply only to particular classes of such algorithms, like AEAD algorithms based on block ciphers (such algorithms use a block cipher as a building block). If that is the case, we explicitly point that out in the corresponding section.

	  <name>AEAD Properties</name>
	  <section anchor="Classification" numbered="true" toc="default">
	    <name>Classification of Additional AEAD Properties</name>
	    <t>In this document, we employ a high-level classification of
	    additional properties. This classification aims to provide insight
	    into how one can benefit from each property. The additional
	    properties are categorized into one of these two
	    groups:</t>
	    <ul spacing="normal">
	      <li>Security properties: We classify a property as a security
	      property if it either takes into account new threats or extends
	      adversarial capabilities, in addition to those posed by the
	      typical nonce-respecting adversary whose goal is to compromise
	      confidentiality or data integrity.</li>
	      <li>Implementation properties: We classify a property as an
	      implementation property if it enables more efficient
	      implementations of the AEAD algorithm in specific cases or
	      environments.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <t> We note that some additional properties of AEAD algorithms
	    found in the literature could not be allocated to either of these
	    two groups. The observation is that such properties require an
	    extension of the conventional AEAD interface. We refer to these
	    properties as "additional functionality properties" and define the
	    corresponding group as follows:</t>
	    <ul spacing="normal">
	      <li>Additional functionality properties: We classify a property
	      as an additional functionality property if it introduces new
	      features in addition to the standard AEAD.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <t> With the extension of the conventional AEAD interface, each
	    additional functionality property defines a new class of
	    cryptographic algorithms. Consequently, the basic threats and
	    adversarial capabilities must be redefined for each class. As a
	    result, additional functionality properties consider the basic
	    threats and adversarial capabilities for their class of
	    algorithms, in contrast to security properties, which consider the
	    extended ones. For this reason, we do not focus on additional
	    functionality properties in this document. However, for the sake
	    of completeness, in <xref target="AddProp" format="default"/>, we
	    briefly present two classes of AEAD algorithms with additional
	    functionality.

      <dt>Notes:</dt><dd><t>Leakages during AEAD operation executions are
       implementation-dependent. It is possible to implement symmetric
       algorithms in a way that every possible physical leakage is entirely
       independent of the secret inputs of the algorithm (for example, with a
       masking technique <xref target="CJRR99" format="default" />), meaning
       the adversary doesn't gain any additional information about the
       algorithm's computation via side-channel leakages. We say that an AEAD
       algorithm doesn't provide leakage resistance if it can only achieve leakage
       resistance with such an implementation. Leakage-resistant AEAD
       algorithms aim to place requirements on implementations that are as mild as
       possible to achieve leakage resistance. These requirements
       <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be listed.</t>
       <t>Confidentiality of plaintext in the presence of leakages in the
       encryption operation is unachievable if an adversary can repeat the
       nonce used to encrypt the plaintext in other encryption
       queries. Confidentiality can be achieved only for plaintexts encrypted
       with fresh nonces (analogously to nonce-misuse resilience; see <xref
       target="NM" format="default" />). For further discussions, see <xref
       target="GPPS19" format="default" /> and <xref target="B20"
       format="default" />.</t>
       <t>For primitive-based AEAD algorithms, key evolution (internal
       re-keying <xref target="RFC8645" format="default" />) can contribute to
       achieving leakage resistance with leakages in
       encryption. Confidentiality in the presence of decryption leakages can
       be achieved by two-pass AEAD algorithms with key evolution, which
       compute independent ephemeral key values for encryption and tag
       generation, where the computation of these keys is implemented without
       any leakages. For more discussion on achieving leakage resistance, see

       <t>Leakage Resilience, a well-known weaker property introduced in

       considered. However, following the framework established in
       <xref target="GPPS19" format="default" /> and <xref target="B20"

       degrades no worse than linearly with an increase in the number of users
       <xref target="BT16" format="default" />. However, for some applications
       with a significant number of users, better multi-user guarantees are
       required. For example, in the TLS 1.3 protocol, 
       AEAD algorithms are used with a randomized nonce (deterministically
       derived from a traffic secret and a sequence number) to address this issue. Using nonce
       randomization in block cipher counter-based AEAD modes can contribute
       to multi-user security <xref target="BT16" format="default"
       />. Multi-user usage limits for AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 are

			<t>
				This document gives high-level definitions of AEAD properties. For each security property, we provide an informational reference to a game-based security notion (or security notions if there are separate notions for integrity and confidentiality) that formalizes the property. We only consider game-based notions and security properties that can be formalized using this approach. However, there are different approaches to formalizing AEAD security, like the indifferentiability framework <xref target="BM18" format="default" />; security in such notions should be studied separately. 
			</t>	
			<t>	
				For some properties, examples of AEAD algorithms that provide them are given, with standardized AEAD algorithms preferred for commonly encountered properties. However, for certain properties, only non-standardized algorithms exist. Implementing such algorithms requires careful consideration, and it is advised to contact the algorithm designers for reference implementations and implementation guidelines. 
			</t>

			<t>
			  Every claimed security property of an AEAD algorithm
			  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> undergo security analysis within
			  a relevant notion. It's <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
			  to use the security notions referenced in the
			  document. If an alternative notion is used, proof of
			  equivalence <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> exist, or use of a
			  non-equivalent notion <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
			  indicated. For security properties that extend
			  adversarial capabilities, consideration of integrity
			  and confidentiality separately may be relevant. If
			  the algorithm provides only one of these, that
			  <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be indicated.
			</t>

			<t>
				When specifying security requirements for an AEAD algorithm in an application, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be indicated, for every required security property, whether only integrity or confidentiality is necessary. Additionally, for each security property, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be specified whether an analysis in an alternative security notion is required. We also note that some additional properties come with trade-offs in terms of classical security and efficiency, and they may only be supported in non-standardized or modified AEAD algorithms. This immediately implies challenges in deployment and interoperability. In an application, the requirements for additional AEAD properties <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be highly motivated and justified, and all trade-offs should be carefully considered.

			<name>AEAD Algorithms with Additional Functionality</name>
			<t>
				In this section, we briefly discuss AEAD algorithms that provide additional functionality. As noted in <xref target="Classification" format="default" />, each additional functionality requires a redefinition of the conventional AEAD interface; thus, each additional functionality property defines a new class of cryptographic algorithms.
			</t>

			<t>
				Most importantly, for every AEAD class with additional functionality, conventional security properties must be redefined concerning the targeted additional functionality and the new interface. Although it might be possible to consider a particular AEAD algorithm with additional functionality as a conventional AEAD algorithm and study it for the conventional confidentiality and integrity, security (or insecurity) in that sense won't be sufficient to label that algorithm as a secure (or insecure) additional functionality AEAD. Only security in the sense of the redefined conventional properties would suffice.
			</t>
			<t>
				For the examples given in this section, we leave it out of scope how to concretely redefine conventional security for these classes; we only briefly describe the additional functionality they offer and provide further references.

   <dl spacing="normal" newline="true">

     <dt>Definition:</dt><dd>For a message that only partly differs from some previous message, an
     AEAD algorithm allows re-encrypting and authenticating that 
     message (associated data and a plaintext pair) faster than processing it
     from scratch.</dd>
     <dt>Examples:</dt><dd>Incremental AEAD algorithm of <xref target="SY16" format="default" /></dd>
     <dt>Security notions:</dt><dd>Privacy, authenticity <xref target="SY16" format="default" /></dd>



     <dt>Notes:</dt><dd>When compared with conventional AEAD, the interface of an incremental AEAD algorithm is
     usually expanded with several
     operations, which perform different types of updates. For example, one
     can consider operations such as "Append" or "Chop", which provide a
     straightforward additional functionality. A comprehensive definition of
     an incremental AEAD interface is provided in <xref target="SY16"

   <name>Robust Authenticated Encryption</name>
   <dl spacing="normal" newline="true">
     <dt>Definition:</dt><dd>An AEAD algorithm allows users to choose a
     desired ciphertext expansion (the difference between the length of
     plaintext and corresponding ciphertext) along with an input to the
     encryption operation. This feature enables the regulation of desired data
     integrity guarantees, which depend on ciphertext expansion, for each
     particular application while using the same algorithm
     implementation.</dd>
     <dt>Examples:</dt><dd>AEZ <xref target="HKR2015" format="default" /></dd>
     <dt>Security notions:</dt><dd>Robust Authenticated Encryption (RAE) <xref target="HKR2015" format="default" /></dd>
     <dt>Notes:</dt><dd>The security goal of robust AEAD algorithms is to
     ensure the best possible security, even with small ciphertext expansion
     (referred to as stretch). For instance, analyzing any AEAD algorithm with
     a one-byte stretch for conventional integrity reveals insecurity, as the
     probability of forging a ciphertext is no less than 1/256. Nonetheless,
     from the robust AEAD perspective, an algorithm with such forgery
     probability for a one-byte ciphertext expansion is secure, representing
     the best achievable security in that scenario.</dd>
