      <t>
      A BGP speaker performing policy based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) should not issue route
      refresh to its neighbors because it has received new RPKI data.
      This document updates RFC 8481 by describing how
      to avoid doing so by either keeping a full Adj-RIB-In or saving
      paths dropped due to ROV (Route Origin Validation) so they may be
      reevaluated with respect to new RPKI data.

      <t>
      Memory constraints in early BGP speakers caused classic BGP
      implementations <xref target="RFC4271"/> to not keep a full Adj-RIB-In
      (<xref target="RFC4271" sectionFormat="of" section="1.1"/>). When doing
      RPKI-based Route Origin Validation (ROV) <xref target="RFC6811"/>
      <xref target="RFC8481"/> and similar RPKI-based policy, if such a BGP
      speaker receives new RPKI data, it might not have kept paths previously
      marked as Invalid, etc.  Such an implementation must then request a
      route refresh <xref target="RFC2918"/> <xref target="RFC7313"/> from its
      neighbors to recover the paths that might be covered by these new RPKI
      data.  This will be perceived as rude by those neighbors as it passes a
      serious resource burden on to them.  This document recommends
      implementations keep and mark paths affected by RPKI-based policy, so
      route refresh is no longer needed.

    It is assumed that the reader understands BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>,
    route refresh <xref target="RFC7313"/>, 
    the RPKI <xref target="RFC6480"/>,
    Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) <xref target="RFC6482"/>, 
    the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis"/>,
    RPKI-Based Prefix Validation <xref target="RFC6811"/>, 
    and Origin Validation Clarifications <xref target="RFC8481"/>.
</t>
<t> Note that the term "RPKI-based Route Origin Validation" in this document
means the same as the term "Prefix Origin Validation" used in <xref
target="RFC6811"/>.
</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="experience">
      <name>ROV Experience</name>
<t>
      As Route Origin Validation dropping Invalids has deployed, some
      BGP speaker implementations have been found that, when receiving new
      RPKI data (Validated ROA Payloads (VRPs) <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis"/>),
      issue a BGP route refresh <xref target="RFC7313"/> to all sending
      BGP peers so that they can reevaluate the received paths against the
      new data.
      </t>
      <t>
      In actual deployment, this has been found to be very destructive,
      transferring a serious resource burden to the unsuspecting peers.
      In reaction, RPKI-based Route Origin Validation (ROV) has been
      turned off.  There have been actual de-peerings.
      </t>
      <t>
      As RPKI registration and ROA creation have steadily increased,
      this problem has increased, not just proportionally, but on the
      order of the in-degree of ROV implementing BGP speakers.  As Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA)
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification"/> becomes
      used, the problem will increase.
      </t>
      <t>
      Other mechanisms, such as automated policy provisioning, which
      have flux rates similar to ROV (i.e., on the order of minutes),
      could very well cause similar problems.
      </t>
      <t>
      Therefore, this document updates <xref target="RFC8481"/> by
      describing how to avoid this problem.
      </t>

    <section anchor="rib">
      <name>Keeping Partial Adj-RIB-In Data</name>
      <t>
      If new RPKI data arrive that cause operator policy to invalidate
      the best route and the BGP speaker did not keep the dropped
      routes, then the BGP speaker would issue a route refresh, which this feature
      aims to prevent.
      </t>
      <t>
      A route that is dropped by operator policy due to ROV is, by
      nature, considered ineligible to compete for the best route and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      be kept in the Adj-RIB-In for potential future evaluation.
      </t>
      <t>
      Ameliorating the route refresh problem by keeping a full
      Adj-RIB-In can be a problem for resource-constrained BGP speakers.
      In reality, only some data need be retained.  If an implementation
      chooses not to retain the full Adj-RIB-In, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> retain at least
      routes dropped due to ROV for potential future evaluation.
      </t>
      <t>
      As storing these routes could cause problems in resource-constrained
      devices, there <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a global operation, CLI, YANG, or
      other mechanism that allows the operator to enable this feature and
      store the dropped routes.  Such an operator control <bcp14>MUST
      NOT</bcp14> be per peer, as this could cause inconsistent behavior.
      </t>
      <t>
      As a side note, policy that may drop routes due to RPKI-based
      checks such as ROV (and ASPA, BGPsec <xref target="RFC8205"/>,
      etc., in the future) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be run and the dropped routes saved per
      this section, before non-RPKI policies are run, as the latter may
      change path attributes.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="ops">
      <name>Operational Recommendations</name>
      <t>
      Operators deploying ROV and/or other RPKI-based policies should
      ensure that the BGP speaker implementation is not causing
      route refresh requests to neighbors.
      </t>
      <t>
      BGP speakers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> either keep the full Adj-RIB-In or implement the
      specification in <xref target="rib"/>.  Conformance to this
      behavior is an additional, mandatory capability for BGP speakers
      performing ROV.
      </t>
      <t>
      If the BGP speaker does not implement these recommendations, the
      operator should enable the vendor's control to keep the full
      Adj-RIB-In, sometimes referred to as "soft reconfiguration
      inbound".  The operator should then measure to ensure that there
      are no unnecessary route refresh requests sent to neighbors.
      </t>
      <t>
      If the BGP speaker's equipment has insufficient resources to
      support either of the two proposed options (keeping a full
      AdjRibIn or at least the dropped routes), the equipment <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
      either be replaced with capable equipment or <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be used
      for ROV.
      </t>
      <t>
      The configuration setting in <xref target="rib"/> should only be
      used in very well-known and controlled circumstances where the
      scaling issues are well understood and anticipated.
      </t>
      <t>
      Operators using the specification in <xref target="rib"/> should
      be aware that a misconfigured neighbor might erroneously send a
      massive number of paths, thus consuming a lot of memory.  Hence,
      pre-policy filtering such as described in <xref target="I-D.sas-idr-maxprefix-inbound"/> could be used to reduce
      this exposure.
      </t>
      <t>
      If route refresh has been issued toward more than one peer, the
      order of receipt of the refresh data can cause churn in both best
      route selection and outbound signaling.
      </t>
      <t>
      Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) that provide route servers <xref target="RFC7947"/> should be aware that some members
      could be causing an undue route refresh load on the route servers
      and take appropriate administrative and/or technical measures.
      IXPs using BGP speakers as route servers should ensure that they
      are not generating excessive route refresh requests.
