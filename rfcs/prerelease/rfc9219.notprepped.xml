      <t>
        <xref target="RFC8621" format="default">JMAP for Mail</xref> is a JSON-based application protocol for synchronizing email data
        between a client and a server.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes an extension to JMAP for returning the S/MIME
        signature verification status <xref target="RFC8551"
        format="default"/>, without requiring a JMAP client to download the
        signature body part and all signed body parts (when the
        multipart/signed media type <xref target="RFC1847" format="default"/>
        is used) or to download and decode the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
        (when the application/pkcs7-mime media type (<xref target="RFC8551"
        section="3.2" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>) is used).  The
        use of the extension implies the client trusts the JMAP server's
        S/MIME signature verification code and configuration.  This extension
        is suitable for cases where reduction in network bandwidth and
        client-side code complexity outweigh security concerns about trusting
        the JMAP server to perform S/MIME signature verifications. One
        possible use case is when the same organization controls both the JMAP
        server and the JMAP client.

	  <dd>If "smimeStatusAtDelivery" is included in the list of requested
        properties, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be interpreted by the server as a request to
        return the "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response property. (It is effectively the same as
	the "smimeStatus"
        value calculated at the date/time of delivery, as specified by "receivedAt".)</dd>

        return the "smimeVerifiedAt" response property.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>The "smimeStatus" response property is defined as follows:</t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
          <dt><strong>smimeStatus</strong>:</dt>
	  <dd><t>"String|null" (server-set). null signifies that the message doesn't

        and certificate verification status calculated according to
        <xref target="RFC8551" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8550" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC5280" format="default"/>.
        Possible string values of the property are
        listed below.  Servers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> return other values not defined below,
        as defined in extensions to this document.
        Clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat unrecognized values as "unknown" or "signed/failed".
        Note that the value of this property might change over time.</t>
	<dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
          <dt>unknown:</dt>
          <dd>
            An S/MIME message, but it was neither signed nor encrypted.
            This can also be returned for a multipart/signed message that
            contains an unrecognized signing protocol (for example, OpenPGP).
          </dd>
          <dt>signed:</dt>
          <dd>
            An S/MIME signed message, but the signature was not yet
            verified.  Some servers might not attempt to verify a signature
            until a particular message is requested by the client.
            (This is a useful optimization for a JMAP server to avoid doing work until exact
	    information is needed.
            A JMAP client that only needs to display an icon that signifies presence of an
	    S/MIME signature can still use this value.)
            JMAP servers compliant with this document <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> attempt signature
	    verification
            and return "signed/verified" or "signed/failed" instead of this signature
            status.
          </dd>
          <dt>signed/verified:</dt>
          <dd>
            An S/MIME signed message, and the sender's signature
            was successfully verified according to
            <xref target="RFC8551" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8550"
	    format="default"/>. 
            Additionally, the signer email address extracted from the S/MIME
            certificate matches the From header field value, and
            the signer certificate <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be checked for revocation.
          </dd>
          <dt>signed/failed:</dt>
          <dd>
            S/MIME signed message, but the signature failed to
            verify according to <xref target="RFC8551" format="default"/> and <xref
	    target="RFC8550" format="default"/>.
            This might be because of a policy-related decision (e.g., the message signer
	    email address
            doesn't match the From header field value), the message was modified,
            the signer's certificate has expired or was revoked, etc.
          </dd>
          <dt>encrypted+signed/verified:</dt>
          <dd>
            This value is reserved for future use. It is typically handled in the same way as "signed/verified".
          </dd>
          <dt>encrypted+signed/failed:</dt>
          <dd>
            This value is reserved for future use. It is typically handled in the same way as "signed/failed".
          </dd>
	</dl>
	  </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>The "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response property
      has the same syntax as "smimeStatus" but is calculated in relationship to the "receivedAt"
      date/time.
      Unlike "smimeStatus", the "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response property
      value doesn't change unless trust anchors are added. (For example, addition of a trust anchor
      can change the value of a message "smimeStatusAtDelivery" property from "signed/failed"
      to "signed/verified". Note that trust anchor removal doesn't affect this response property.)
      The "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response property value allows clients to compare the S/MIME
      signature verification status at delivery with the current status as returned
      by "smimeStatus", for example, to help to answer questions like
      "was the signature valid at the time of delivery?".
        </t>
        <t>Note that the "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response property
      value doesn't have to be calculated at delivery time. A JMAP server
      can defer its calculation until it is explicitly requested;
      however, once it is calculated, its value is remembered for later use.
        </t>
        <t>The "smimeErrors" response property is defined as follows:</t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
          <dt><strong>smimeErrors</strong>:</dt>
	  <dd>"String[]|null" (server-set). null signifies that the message doesn't
        contain any signature or that there were no errors when verifying
        the S/MIME signature. (That is, this property is non-null only
        when the corresponding "smimeStatus" response property value
        is "signed/failed" or "encrypted+signed/failed".
	Note that future extensions to this document
        can specify other "smimeStatus" values that can be used with "smimeErrors".)
        Each string in the array is a human-readable description
        (in the language specified in the Content-Language header field, if any)
        of a problem with the signature, the signing certificate, or the signing certificate
	chain.
        (See <xref target="RFC8620" section="3.8" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> in regards to how this
	is affected
        by the language selection.)
        In one example, the signing certificate might be expired
        and the message From email address might not correspond to any of the email
        addresses in the signing certificate.
        In another example, the certificate might be expired and the JMAP server might
	be unable
        to retrieve a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for the certificate.
        In both of these cases, there would be 2 elements in the array.
          </dd>
	</dl>
        <t>The "smimeVerifiedAt" response property is defined as follows:</t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
          <dt><strong>smimeVerifiedAt</strong>:</dt>
	  <dd>"UTCDate|null" (server-set). null signifies that the message doesn't
        contain any S/MIME signature or that there is a signature, but there was no attempt
        to verify it.
        (Retrieval of the "smimeStatus" value can be used to distinguish these 2 cases).
        In all other cases, it is set to the date and time of when the S/MIME signature
        was most recently verified.
        Note that a request to fetch "smimeStatus", "smimeStatusAtDelivery", and/or "smimeErrors" would force this response
        property to be set to a non-null value if an S/MIME signature exists.
          </dd>
	</dl>
        <t>The "smimeStatus" and "smimeErrors" values are calculated at the time the
	corresponding JMAP	
      request is processed (but see below about the effect of result caching),
      not at the time when the message is generated (according to its
      Date header field value). In all cases, "smimeVerifiedAt" is set to the time when
      "smimeStatus" and "smimeErrors" were last updated.
      As recalculating these values is expensive for the server,
      they <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be cached for up to 24 hours from the moment when they were calculated.

          Future extensions to this document can specify extra allowed values for the "smimeStatus" response property.
          All values (defined in this document or in extensions to this document) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be in ASCII.
          (Note that this response property contains tokens; thus, it is not subject to
          internationalization or localization).          
          </t>
          <t>
          New "smimeStatus" response property values defined in extensions may affect the behavior of
          properties, such as the "smimeErrors" response property of Email/get (see <xref target="email-get-ext" format="default"/>) or the
          "hasVerifiedSmime" property of Email/query (see <xref target="email-query-ext" format="default"/>). In particular,
          the new values can be treated similarly to values defined in this document.
          </t>
          <t>
          For example, a putative JMAP extension for automatically decrypting S/MIME messages can specify
          two additional values, one specifying that a message is both encrypted and signed with a valid S/MIME signature
          (e.g. "encrypted+signed/verified")
          and another one specifying that a message is both encrypted and signed with an invalid S/MIME signature
          (e.g. "encrypted+signed/failed").
          The former value can be treated as "signed/verified" (and would thus affect "hasVerifiedSmime")
          and the latter can be treated as "signed/failed" (and thus can be used with "smimeErrors").

          Note that use of this attribute is potentially expensive for a JMAP server, as it
	  forces

      <t>
      Use of the server-side S/MIME signature verification JMAP extension requires
      the client to trust the server signature verification code, the server configuration, and
      the server's operational practices
      to perform S/MIME signature verification, as well as to trust that the channel between
      the client and the server is integrity protected.
      (For example, if the server is not configured
      with some trust anchors, some messages will have the "signed/failed" status
      instead of "signed/verified".)
      A malicious or compromised server could
      return a false verification status to a client.  A successful verification could
      be conveyed to a client for a forged or altered message.  A properly signed
      message could be signaled as having a failed signature verification or no
      signature at all.  In the case of the latter attack, no new attack surface is
      presented with this extension above what a malicious or compromised server could
      already do by stripping or tampering with the S/MIME information in the
      message.  In the case of the former attack, client software capable of
      performing S/MIME signature verification could detect this attack.  Local
      configuration of the client should determine if this client-side verification
      should occur.  For clients without local verification capabilities, such an
      attack would be difficult to detect.
      </t>
      <t>
      Integrity protection of the channel between the client and the server is provided by use of TLS,
      as required by the JMAP specification (see <xref target="RFC8620" section="8.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>).
      </t>
      <t>Constant recalculation of the S/MIME signature status can result in a denial-of-service condition.
      For that reason, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that servers cache results of signature verification for up to 24 hours.</t>
