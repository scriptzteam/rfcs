    <abstract>
<t>This document describes the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Certificate Management Protocol (CMP).  Protocol messages are defined for
X.509v3 certificate creation and management. CMP provides interactions between
client systems and PKI components such as a Registration Authority (RA) and
a Certification Authority (CA).</t>
      <t>This document adds support for management of certificates containing a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) public key and uses
EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue. This document also includes the
updates specified in Section 2 and Appendix A.2 of RFC 9480.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 4210, and together with RFC 9811, it also obsoletes RFC 9480. Appendix F of this document updates
Section 9 of RFC 5912.</t>

      <t>This document describes the Internet X.509 PKI CMP.  Protocol messages are
defined for certificate creation and management.  The term
"certificate" in this document refers to an X.509v3 certificate as
defined in <xref target="RFC5280"/>.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-1.1">
        <name>Changes Made by RFC 4210</name>
        <t><xref target="RFC4210"/> differs from <xref target="RFC2510"/> in the following areas:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>The PKI management message profile section is split to two
appendices: the required profile and the optional profile.  Some
of the formerly mandatory functionality is moved to the optional
profile.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The message confirmation mechanism has changed substantially.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A new polling mechanism is introduced, deprecating the old polling
method at the CMP transport level.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The CMP transport protocol issues are handled in a separate
document <xref target="RFC6712"/>, thus the "Transports" section is removed.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A new implicit confirmation method is introduced to reduce the
number of protocol messages exchanged in a transaction.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The new specification contains some less prominent protocol
enhancements and improved explanatory text on several issues.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-1.2">
        <name>Updates Made by RFC 9480</name>
        <t>CMP Updates <xref target="RFC9480"/> and CMP Algorithms <xref target="RFC9481"/> updated <xref target="RFC4210"/>, supporting the PKI management operations specified in the Lightweight CMP
Profile <xref target="RFC9483"/>, in the following areas:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Added new extended key usages (EKUs) for various CMP server types, e.g., RA and CA, to express the authorization of the
certificate holder that acts as the indicated type of PKI management entity.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Extended the description of multiple protection to cover additional use cases,
e.g., batch processing of messages.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Used the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> type EnvelopedData as the preferred choice instead of
EncryptedValue to better support crypto agility in CMP.  </t>
            <t>
For reasons of completeness and consistency, the type EncryptedValue has been
exchanged in all occurrences.  This includes the protection of centrally
generated private keys, encryption of certificates, Proof-of-Possession (POP) methods, and protection of revocation
passphrases. To properly differentiate the support of EnvelopedData instead
of EncryptedValue, CMP version 3 is introduced in case a transaction
is supposed to use EnvelopedData.  </t>
            <t>
Note: According to point 9 in <xref section="2.1" target="RFC4211"/>, the use of the EncryptedValue structure has been deprecated
in favor of the EnvelopedData structure. <xref target="RFC4211"/> offers the EncryptedKey structure a choice of EncryptedValue and EnvelopedData
for migration to EnvelopedData.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Offered an optional hashAlg field in CertStatus supporting cases when a certificate
needs to be confirmed, but the certificate was signed using a signature algorithm that does not indicate
a specific hash algorithm to use for computing the certHash.  This is also in
preparation for upcoming post-quantum algorithms.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Added new general message types to request CA certificates, a root CA update,
a certificate request template, or Certificate Revocation List (CRL) updates.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Extended the use of polling to p10cr, certConf, rr, genm, and error messages.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Deleted the mandatory algorithm profile in <xref target="sect-c.2"/> and instead referred to <xref section="7" target="RFC9481"/>.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Added Sections <xref format="counter" target="sect-8.6"/>, <xref format="counter" target="sect-8.7"/>, <xref format="counter" target="sect-8.9"/>, and <xref format="counter" target="sect-8.10"/> to the security considerations.</t>

        <name>Changes Made by This Document</name>
<t>This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC4210"/> and <xref target="RFC9480"/>.</t>
<t> Backward compatibility with CMP version 2 is maintained
  wherever possible.  Updates to CMP version 2 improve crypto
  agility, extend the polling mechanism, add new general message
  types, and add EKUs to identify special CMP
  server authorizations.  CMP version 3 is introduced for changes to
  the ASN.1 syntax, which support EnvelopedData, certConf with hashAlg,
  POPOPrivKey with agreeMAC, and RootCaKeyUpdateContent in ckuann
  messages.</t>
<t>The updates made in this document include the
  changes specified by Section <xref section="2" target="RFC9480" sectionFormat="bare"/> and <xref section="A.2" target="RFC9480"/> as described in <xref target="sect-1.2"/>. Additionally, this document updates the content of <xref target="RFC4210"/> in the following areas:</t>

      <name>PKI Management Overview</name>
      <t>The PKI must be structured to be consistent with the types of
individuals who must administer it.  Providing such administrators
with unbounded choices not only complicates the software required
but also increases the chances that a subtle mistake by an
administrator or software developer will result in broader
compromise.  Similarly, restricting administrators with cumbersome
mechanisms will cause them not to use the PKI.</t>
      <t>Management protocols are <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> to support online interactions
between PKI components.  For example, a
management protocol might be used between a
CA and a client system with which a key pair is associated or
between two CAs that issue cross-certificates for each other.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-3.1">
        <name>PKI Management Model</name>
        <t>Before specifying particular message formats and procedures, we first
define the entities involved in PKI management and their interactions
(in terms of the PKI management functions required).  We then group
these functions in order to accommodate different identifiable types
of end entities.</t>
        <section anchor="sect-3.1.1">
          <name>Definitions of PKI Entities</name>
          <t>The entities involved in PKI management include the end entity (i.e.,
the entity to whom the certificate is issued) and the CA (i.e., the entity that issues the certificate).  An RA might also be involved in PKI management.</t>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.1">
            <name>Subjects and End Entities</name>
            <t>The term "subject" is used here to refer to the entity to whom the
certificate is issued, typically named in the subject or
subjectAltName field of a certificate.  When we wish to distinguish
the tools and/or software used by the subject (e.g., a local
certificate management module), we will use the term "subject equipment".
In general, the term "end entity", rather than
"subject", is preferred in order to avoid confusion with the field
name.  It is important to note that the end entities here will
include not only human users of applications but also applications
themselves (e.g., for 		Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) / IPsec) or devices (e.g., routers or industrial
control systems).  This factor influences the
protocols that the PKI management operations use; for example,
application software is far more likely to know exactly which
certificate extensions are required than are human users.  PKI
management entities are also end entities in the sense that they are
sometimes named in the subject or subjectAltName field of a
certificate or cross-certificate.  Where appropriate, the term "end entity"
will be used to refer to end entities who are not PKI
management entities.</t>
            <t>All end entities require secure local access to some information --
at a minimum, their own name and private key, the name of a CA that
is directly trusted by this entity, and that CA's public key (or a
fingerprint of the public key where a self-certified version is
available elsewhere).  Implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use secure local storage
for more than this minimum (e.g., the end entity's own certificates or
application-specific information).  The form of storage will also
vary -- from files to tamper-resistant cryptographic tokens.  The
information stored in such local, trusted storage is referred to here
as the end entity's TEE, also known as
Personal Security Environment (PSE).</t>
            <t>Though TEE formats are beyond the scope of this document (they are
very dependent on equipment, et cetera), a generic interchange format
for TEEs is defined here: a certification response message (see <xref target="sect-5.3.4"/>) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
used.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.2">
            <name>Certification Authority</name>
            <t>The CA may or may not actually be a real
"third party" from the end entity's point of view.  Quite often, the
CA will actually belong to the same organization as the end entities
it supports.</t>
            <t>Again, we use the term "CA" to refer to the entity named in the
issuer field of a certificate.  When it is necessary to distinguish
the software or hardware tools used by the CA, we use the term "CA equipment".</t>
            <t>The CA equipment will often include both an "offline" component and
an "online" component, with the CA private key only available to the
"offline" component.  This is, however, a matter for implementers
(though it is also relevant as a policy issue).</t>
            <t>We use the term "root CA" to indicate a CA that is directly trusted
by an end entity; that is, securely acquiring the value of a root CA
public key requires some out-of-band step(s). This term is not meant
to imply that a root CA is necessarily at the top of any hierarchy,
simply that the CA in question is trusted directly.  The "root CA"
may provide its trust anchor information with or without using a
certificate.  In some circumstances, such a certificate may be
self-signed, but in other circumstances, it may be cross-signed,
signed by a peer, signed by a superior CA, or unsigned.</t>
            <t>Note that other documents like <xref target="X509.2019"/> and <xref target="RFC5280"/> use the
term "trusted CA" or "trust anchor" instead of "root CA".  This
document continues using "root CA" based on the above definition
because it is also present in the ASN.1 syntax that cannot be changed
easily.</t>
            <t>A "subordinate CA" is one that is not a root CA for the end entity in
question.  Often, a subordinate CA will not be a root CA for any
entity, but this is not mandatory.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.3">
            <name>Registration Authority</name>
            <t>In addition to end entities and CAs, many environments call for the
existence of an RA separate from the
CA.  The functions that the RA may carry out will vary from case to case but <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include
identity checking, token distribution, checking certificate requests
and authentication of their origin, revocation reporting,
name assignment, archival of key pairs, et cetera.</t>
            <t>This document views the RA as an <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> component: When it is not
present, the CA is assumed to be able to carry out the RA's functions
so that the PKI management protocols are the same from the 
end entity's point of view.</t>
            <t>Again, we distinguish, where necessary, between the RA and the tools
used (the "RA equipment").</t>
            <t>Note that an RA is itself an end entity.  We further assume that all
RAs are in fact certified end entities and that RAs have private keys
that are usable for signing.  How a particular CA equipment
identifies some end entities as RAs is an implementation issue (i.e.,
this document specifies no special RA certification operation).  We
do not mandate that the RA is certified by the CA with which it is
interacting at the moment (so one RA may work with more than one CA
whilst only being certified once).</t>
            <t>In some circumstances, end entities will communicate directly with a
CA even where an RA is present.  For example, for initial
registration and/or certification, the end entity may use its RA but
communicate directly with the CA in order to refresh its certificate.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.4">
            <name>Key Generation Authority</name>
            <t>A KGA is a PKI management entity generating key
pairs on behalf of an end entity. As the KGA generates the key pair, it
knows the public and the private part.</t>
            <t>This document views the KGA as an <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> component. When it is not present
and central key generation is needed, the CA is assumed to be able to carry
out the KGA's functions so that the PKI management protocol messages are the
same from the end entity's point of view. If certain tasks of a CA are
delegated to other components, this delegation needs authorization, which can
be indicated by EKUs (see <xref target="sect-4.5"/>).</t>
            <t>Note: When doing central generation of key pairs, implementers should consider
the implications of server-side retention on the overall security of the
system; in some cases, retention is good, for example, for escrow reasons, but
in other cases, the server should clear its copy after delivery to the end entity.</t>
            <t>Note: If the CA delegates key generation to a KGA, the KGA can be collocated
with the RA.</t>

  CA, RA, or end entity may, in principle, use whichever
  algorithms suit it for its own key pair(s).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>PKI management protocols must not preclude the generation of key
  pairs by the end entity concerned, by a KGA, or by a CA.  Key
  generation may also occur elsewhere, but for the purposes of PKI
  management, we can regard key generation as occurring wherever
  the key is first present at an end entity, KGA, or CA.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>PKI management protocols must support the publication of
  certificates by the end entity concerned, by an RA, or by a CA.
  Different implementations and different environments may choose
  any of the above approaches.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>PKI management protocols must support the production of
  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) by allowing certified end entities
  to make requests for the revocation of certificates.
  This must be done in such a way that the denial-of-service
  attacks, which are possible, are not made simpler.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>PKI management protocols must be usable over a variety of
  "transport" mechanisms, specifically including email, Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT),
  Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and various offline and non-networked file transfer methods.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Final authority for certification creation rests with the CA.
  No RA or end entity equipment can assume that any certificate
  issued by a CA will contain what was requested; a CA may alter
  certificate field values or may add, delete, or alter extensions
  according to its operating policy.  In other words, all PKI
  entities (end entities, RAs, KGAs, and CAs) must be capable of
  handling responses to requests for certificates in which the
  actual certificate issued is different from that requested (for
  example, a CA may shorten the validity period requested).  Note
  that policy may dictate that the CA must not publish or
  otherwise distribute the certificate until the requesting entity
  has reviewed and accepted the newly created certificate or the
  POP is completed. In case of publication of the certificate
  (when using indirect POP, see <xref target="sect-8.11"/>) or a precertificate
  in a CT log <xref target="RFC9162"/>, the certificate
  must be revoked if it was not accepted by the end entity or the POP could
  not be completed.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>A graceful, scheduled changeover from one non-compromised CA
  key pair to the next (CA key update) must be supported (note
  that if the CA key is compromised, re-initialization must be
  performed for all entities in the domain of that CA).  An end entity
  whose TEE contains the new CA public key (following a CA
  key update) may also need to be able to verify certificates verifiable
  using the old public key.  End entities who directly trust the
  old CA key pair may also need to be able to verify certificates signed
  using the new CA private key (required for situations where the
  old CA public key is "hardwired" into the end entity's
  cryptographic equipment).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The functions of an RA may, in some implementations or
  environments, be carried out by the CA itself.  The protocols
  must be designed so that end entities will use the same protocol
  regardless of whether the communication is with an RA or CA.
  Naturally, the end entity must use the correct RA or CA public
  key to verify the protection of the communication.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Where an end entity requests a certificate containing a given
  public key value, the end entity must be ready to demonstrate
  possession of the corresponding private key value.  This may be
  accomplished in various ways, depending on the type of
  certification request.  See <xref target="sect-4.3"/> for details of the
  in-band methods defined for the PKIX-CMP (i.e., CMP) messages.</t>

          <t>At a high level, the set of operations for which management
	  messages are defined can be grouped as follows.</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	    <li>CA establishment: When establishing a new CA, certain steps
	    are required (e.g., production of initial CRLs and export of CA
	    public key).</li>
            <li>End entity initialization: This includes importing a root
            CA public key and requesting information about the options
            supported by a PKI management entity.</li>
            <li><t>Certification: Various operations result in the creation
            of new certificates: </t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="a">
                <li>initial registration/certification: This is the process
                whereby an end entity first makes itself known to a CA or RA,
                prior to the CA issuing a certificate or certificates for that
                end entity.  The end result of this process (when it is
                successful) is that a CA issues a certificate for an end entity's
                public key and returns that certificate to the end entity
                and/or posts that certificate in a repository.  This
                process may, and typically will, involve multiple "steps",
                possibly including an initialization of the end entity's
                equipment.  For example, the end entity's equipment must be
                securely initialized with the public key of a CA, e.g., using
                zero-touch methods like Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
                Infrastructure (BRSKI) <xref target="RFC8995"/> or Secure Zero
                Touch Provisioning (SZTP) <xref target="RFC8572"/>, to be used
                in validating certificate paths.  Furthermore, an end entity
                typically needs to be initialized with its own key
                pair(s).</li>
                <li>key pair update: Every key pair needs to be updated
                regularly (i.e., replaced with a new key pair), and a new
                certificate needs to be issued.</li>
                <li>certificate update: As certificates expire, they may be
                "refreshed" if nothing relevant in the environment has
                changed.</li>
                <li>CA key pair update: As with end entities, CA key pairs need
                to be updated regularly; however, different mechanisms are
                required.</li>
                <li><t>cross-certification request: One CA requests issuance of a
                cross-certificate from another CA.  For the purposes of this
                standard, the following terms are defined.  A
                "cross-certificate" is a certificate in which the subject CA
                and the issuer CA are distinct and SubjectPublicKeyInfo
                contains a verification key (i.e., the certificate has been
                issued for the subject CA's signing key pair).  When it is
                necessary to distinguish more finely, the following terms may
                be used: A cross-certificate is called an "inter-domain
                cross-certificate" if the subject and issuer CAs belong to
                different administrative domains; it is called an
                "intra-domain cross-certificate" otherwise.</t>       
		<ol type="Note %d:">
                  <li>The above definition of "cross-certificate"
                  aligns with the defined term "CA-certificate" in X.509.
                  Note that this term is not to be confused with the X.500
                  "cACertificate" attribute type, which is unrelated.</li>
                  <li>In many environments, the term
                  "cross-certificate", unless further qualified, will be
                  understood to be synonymous with "inter-domain
                  cross-certificate" as defined above.</li>
                  <li>Issuance of cross-certificates may be, but is
                  not necessarily, mutual; that is, two CAs may issue
                  cross-certificates for each other.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>cross-certificate update: Similar to a normal certificate
		update but involving a cross-certificate.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><t>Certificate/CRL discovery operations: Some PKI management
            operations result in the publication of certificates or CRLs: </t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="a">
		<li>certificate publication: Having gone to the trouble of
		producing a certificate, some means for publishing may be
		needed.  The "means" defined in PKIX <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
		involve the messages specified in Sections <xref
		format="counter" target="sect-5.3.13"/> to <xref
		format="counter" target="sect-5.3.16"/> or <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
		involve other methods (for example, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)) as described in
		<xref target="RFC4511"/> or <xref target="RFC2585"/> (the
		"Operational Protocols" documents of the PKIX series of

            </li>
            <li><t>Recovery operations: Some PKI management operations are
            used when an end entity has "lost" its TEE:</t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="a">
		<li>key pair recovery: As an option, user client key
		materials (e.g., a user's private key used for decryption
		purposes) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be backed up by a CA, an RA, or a
		key backup system associated with a CA or RA.  If an entity
		needs to recover these backed up key materials (e.g., as a
		result of a forgotten password or a lost key chain file), a
		protocol exchange may be needed to support such recovery.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><t>Revocation operations: Some PKI management operations
            result in the creation of new CRL entries and/or new CRLs:</t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="a">
		<li>revocation request: An authorized person advises a CA
		of an abnormal situation requiring certificate revocation.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>TEE operations: Whilst the definition of TEE operations
            (e.g., moving a TEE, changing a PIN, etc.) are beyond the scope of
            this specification, we do define a PKIMessage (CertRepMessage)
            that can form the basis of such operations.</li>
          </ol>

          <t>Note that online protocols are not the only way of implementing the
above operations.  For all operations, there are offline methods of
achieving the same result, and this specification does not mandate
use of online protocols.  For example, when hardware tokens are
used, many of the operations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be achieved as part of the physical
token delivery.</t>
          <t>Later sections define a set of standard messages supporting the above
operations.  Transfer protocols for conveying these exchanges in
various environments (e.g., offline: file-based; online: email,
HTTP <xref target="RFC9811"/>, MQTT, and CoAP <xref target="RFC9482"/>) are
beyond the scope of this document and must be specified separately.
Appropriate transfer protocols <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be capable of delivering the CMP
messages reliably.</t>
          <t>CMP provides inbuilt integrity protection and authentication. The information
communicated unencrypted in CMP messages does not contain sensitive
information endangering the security of the PKI when intercepted. However,
it might be possible for an eavesdropper to utilize the available information to
gather confidential technical or business-critical information. Therefore, users
should consider protection of confidentiality on lower levels of the protocol
stack, e.g., by using TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, DTLS <xref target="RFC9147"/>, or IPsec <xref target="RFC7296"/><xref target="RFC4303"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-4.1">
        <name>End Entity Initialization</name>
        <t>The first step for an end entity in dealing with PKI management
entities is to request information about the PKI functions supported
and to securely acquire a copy of the relevant root CA public key(s).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-4.2">
        <name>Initial Registration/Certification</name>
        <t>There are many schemes that can be used to achieve initial
registration and certification of end entities.  No one method is
suitable for all situations due to the range of policies that a CA
may implement and the variation in the types of end entity that can
occur.</t>
        <t>However, we can classify the initial registration/certification
schemes that are supported by this specification.  Note that the word
"initial", above, is crucial: We are dealing with the situation where
the end entity in question has had no previous contact with the PKI,
except having received the root CA certificate of that PKI by some
zero-touch method like BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>
<xref target="RFC9733"/> or SZTP <xref target="RFC8572"/>.  In case the end entity
already possesses certified keys, then some
simplifications/alternatives are possible.</t>
        <t>Having classified the schemes that are supported by this
specification, we can then specify some as mandatory and some as
optional.  The goal is that the mandatory schemes cover a sufficient
number of the cases that will arise in real use, whilst the optional
schemes are available for special cases that arise less frequently.
In this way, we achieve a balance between flexibility and ease of
implementation.</t>
        <t>Further classification of mandatory and optional schemes addressing
different environments is available, e.g., in Appendices <xref target="sect-c" format="counter"/> and
<xref target="sect-d" format="counter"/> of this specification on managing human user certificates
as well as in the Lightweight CMP Profile <xref target="RFC9483"/> on fully
automating certificate management in a machine-to-machine and Internet of Things (IoT)
environment. Industry standards such as <xref target="ETSI-3GPP.33.310"/> for
mobile networks and <xref target="UNISIG.Subset-137"/> for railroad automation have adopted
CMP and defined a series of mandatory schemes for their use cases.</t>
        <t>We will now describe the classification of initial
registration/certification schemes.</t>

          <name>Criteria Used</name>
          <section anchor="sect-4.2.1.1">
            <name>Initiation of Registration/Certification</name>
            <t>In terms of the PKI messages that are produced, we can regard the
initiation of the initial registration/certification exchanges as
occurring wherever the first PKI message relating to the end entity
is produced.  Note that the real-world initiation of the
registration/certification procedure may occur elsewhere (e.g., a
personnel department may telephone an RA operator or use zero-touch
methods like BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> or SZTP <xref target="RFC8572"/>).</t>
            <t>The possible locations are at the end entity, an RA, or a CA.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-4.2.1.2">
            <name>End Entity Message Origin Authentication</name>
            <t>The online messages produced by the end entity that requires a
certificate may be authenticated or not.  The requirement here is to
authenticate the origin of any messages from the end entity to the
PKI (CA/RA).</t>
            <t>In this specification, such authentication is achieved by two different means:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
                <t>symmetric: The PKI (CA/RA) issuing the end entity with a secret value (initial
authentication key) and reference value (used to identify the secret value)
via some out-of-band means.  The initial authentication key can then be used
to protect relevant PKI messages.</t>
              </li>     
              <li>
                <t>asymmetric: Using a private key and certificate issued by another PKI trusted
for initial authentication, e.g., an Initial Device Identifier (IDevID) <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR-2018">IEEE 802.1AR</xref>.
The trust establishment in this external PKI is out of scope of this document.</t>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <t>Thus, we can classify the initial registration/certification scheme
according to whether or not the online 'end entity -&gt; PKI management
entity' messages are authenticated or not.</t>
<ol type="Note %d:">
            <li>We do not discuss the authentication of the 'PKI management
entity -&gt; end entity' messages here, as this is always <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>.  In any case, it can be
achieved simply once the root-CA public key has been installed at the
end entity's equipment or it can be based on the initial
authentication key.</li>
            <li>An initial registration/certification procedure can be secure
where the messages from the end entity are authenticated via some
out-of-band means (e.g., a subsequent visit).</li>
</ol>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-4.2.1.3">
            <name>Location of Key Generation</name>
            <t>In this specification, "key generation" is regarded as occurring
wherever either the public or private component of a key pair first
occurs in a PKIMessage.  Note that this does not preclude a
centralized key generation service by a KGA; the actual key pair <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> have
been
generated elsewhere and transported to the end entity, RA, or CA
using a (proprietary or standardized) key generation request/response
protocol (outside the scope of this specification).</t>
            <t>Thus, there are three possibilities for the location of "key generation":
the end entity, a KGA, or a CA.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-4.2.1.4">
            <name>Confirmation of Successful Certification</name>
            <t>Following the creation of a certificate for an end entity,
additional assurance can be gained by having the end entity
explicitly confirm successful receipt of the message containing (or
indicating the creation of) the certificate.  Naturally, this
confirmation message must be protected (based on the initial
symmetric or asymmetric authentication key or other means).</t>
            <t>This gives two further possibilities: confirmed or not.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sect-4.2.2">
          <name>Initial Registration/Certification Schemes</name>
          <t>The criteria above allow for a large number of initial
registration/certification schemes.  Examples of possible initial
registration/certification schemes can be found in the following
subsections.  An entity may support other schemes specified in
profiles of PKIX-CMP, such as Appendices <xref target="sect-c" format="counter"/> and <xref target="sect-d" format="counter"/> or <xref target="RFC9483"/>.</t>
          <section anchor="sect-4.2.2.1">
            <name>Centralized Scheme</name>
            <t>In terms of the classification above, this scheme is, in some ways,
the simplest possible, where:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
                <t>initiation occurs at the certifying CA;</t>

                <t>no confirmation message is required.</t>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <t>In terms of message flow, this scheme means that the only message
required is sent from the CA to the end entity.  The message must
contain the entire TEE for the end entity.  Some out-of-band means
must be provided to allow the end entity to authenticate the message
received and to decrypt any encrypted values.</t>

            <name>Basic Authenticated Scheme</name>

        <name>POP of Private Key</name>
        <t>POP is where a PKI management entity (CA/RA)
verifies if an end entity has access to the private key
corresponding to a given public key. The question of whether, and in
what circumstances, POPs add value to a PKI is a debate as old as PKI
itself! See <xref target="sect-8.1"/> for a further discussion on the necessity
of POP in PKI.</t>
        <t>The PKI management operations specified here make it possible
for an end entity to prove to a CA/RA that it has possession of (i.e., is able
to use) the private key corresponding to the public key for which a
certificate is requested (see <xref target="sect-5.2.8"/> for different POP methods).  A given CA/RA is free to choose how to
enforce POP (e.g., out-of-band procedural means versus PKIX-CMP
in-band messages) in its certification exchanges (i.e., this may be a
policy issue).  However, it is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> that CAs/RAs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> enforce POP
by some means because there are currently many non-PKIX operational
protocols in use (various electronic mail protocols are one example)
that do not explicitly check the binding between the end entity and
the private key.  Until operational protocols that do verify the
binding (for signature, encryption, key agreement, and KEM key pairs)
exist, and are ubiquitous, this binding can only be assumed to have
been verified by the CA/RA.  Therefore, if the binding is not
verified by the CA/RA, certificates in the Internet PKI
end up being somewhat less meaningful.</t>
        <t>POP is accomplished in different ways depending upon the type of key
for which a certificate is requested.  If a key can be used for
multiple purposes (e.g., an RSA key), then any appropriate method <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
be used (e.g., a key that may be used for signing, as well as other
purposes, <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be sent to the CA/RA in order to prove
possession unless archival of the private key is explicitly desired).</t>
        <t>This specification explicitly allows for cases where an end entity
supplies the relevant proof to an RA and the RA subsequently attests
to the CA that the required proof has been received (and validated!).
For example, an end entity wishing to have a signing key certified
could send the appropriate signature to the RA, which then simply
notifies the relevant CA that the end entity has supplied the
required proof.  Of course, such a situation may be disallowed by
some policies (e.g., CAs may be the only entities permitted to verify
POP during certification).</t>
        <section anchor="sect-4.3.1">
          <name>Signature Keys</name>
          <t>For signature keys, the end entity can sign a value to prove
possession of the private key; see <xref target="sect-5.2.8.2"/>.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sect-4.3.2">
          <name>Encryption Keys</name>
          <t>For encryption keys, the end entity can provide the private key to
the CA/RA (e.g., for archiving), see <xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.1"/>, or can be required to decrypt a value in order to prove
possession of the private key.  Decrypting a
value can be achieved either directly (see <xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.3"/>) or indirectly (see <xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.2"/>).</t>
          <t>The direct method is for the RA/CA to issue a random challenge to
which an immediate response by the end entity is required.</t>
          <t>The indirect method is to issue a certificate that is encrypted for
the end entity (and have the end entity demonstrate its ability to
decrypt this certificate in the confirmation message).  This allows a
CA to issue a certificate in a form that can only be used by the
intended end entity.</t>
          <t>This specification encourages use of the indirect method because it
requires no extra messages to be sent (i.e., the proof can be
demonstrated using the {request, response, confirmation} triple of
messages).</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sect-4.3.3">
          <name>Key Agreement Keys</name>
          <t>For key agreement keys, the end entity and the PKI management entity
(i.e., CA or RA) must establish a shared secret key in order to prove
that the end entity has possession of the private key.</t>
          <t>Note that this need not impose any restrictions on the keys that can
be certified by a given CA.  In particular, for Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys,
the end entity may freely choose its algorithm parameters provided
that the CA can generate a short-term (or one-time) key pair with the
appropriate parameters when necessary.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sect-4.3.4">
          <name>KEM Keys</name>
          <t>For KEM keys, the end entity can provide the private key to
the CA/RA (e.g., for archiving), see <xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.1"/>, or can be required to decrypt
a value in order to prove possession of the private key.
Decrypting a value can be achieved either directly (see <xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.3"/>) or indirectly (see <xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.2"/>).</t>
          <t>Note: A definition of KEMs can be found in <xref section="1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9629"/>.</t>
          <t>The direct method is for the RA/CA to issue a random challenge to which an
immediate response by the end entity is required.</t>
          <t>The indirect method is to issue a certificate that is encrypted for the end entity using a shared secret key derived from a key encapsulated using the public key (and have the end entity demonstrate its ability to use its private key for decapsulation of the KEM ciphertext, derive the shared secret key, decrypt this certificate, and provide a hash of the certificate in the confirmation message).  This allows a CA to issue a certificate in a form that can only be used by the intended end entity.</t>
          <t>This specification encourages use of the indirect method because it requires
no extra messages to be sent (i.e., the proof can be demonstrated using the
{request, response, confirmation} triple of messages).</t>
          <t>A certification request message for a KEM certificate <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> use POPOPrivKey by using the keyEncipherment choice of ProofOfPossession (see <xref target="sect-5.2.8"/>) in the popo field of CertReqMsg as long as no KEM-specific choice is available.</t>

        <name>Root CA Key Update</name>
        <t>This discussion only applies to CAs that are directly trusted by some
end entities.  Recognizing whether a self-signed or non-self-signed
CA is supposed to be directly trusted for some end entities is a
matter of CA policy and end entity configuration. Thus, this is beyond
the scope of this document.</t>
        <t>The basis of the procedure described here is that the CA protects its
new public key using its previous private key and vice versa. Thus,
when a CA updates its key pair, it may generate two link certificates:
	"old with new" and "new with old".</t>	
        <t>Note: The usage of link certificates has been shown to be very
specific for each use case, and no assumptions are done on this aspect.
RootCaKeyUpdateContent is updated to specify these link certificates
as optional.</t>
        <t>Note: When an LDAP directory is used to publish root CA updates, the
old and new root CA certificates together with the two link
certificates are stored as cACertificate attribute values.</t>
        <t>When a CA changes its key pair, those entities who have acquired the
old CA public key via "out-of-band" means are most affected.  These
end entities need to acquire the new CA public key in a trusted way.
This may be achieved "out-of-band" by using a repository or by
using online messages also containing the link certificates
"new with old". Once the end entity acquired and properly verified
the new CA public key, it must load the new trust anchor information
into its trusted store.</t>
        <t>The data structure used to protect the new and old CA public keys is
typically a standard X.509v3 certificate (which may also
contain extensions).  There are no new data structures required.</t>
        <t>Note: Sometimes self-signed root CA certificates do not make use of
X.509v3 extensions and may be X.509v1 certificates. Therefore, a
root CA key update must be able to work for version 1 certificates.
The use of the X.509v3 KeyIdentifier extension is recommended for
easier path building.</t>
        <t>Note:  While the scheme could be generalized to cover cases where
the CA updates its key pair more than once during the validity period
of one of its end entities' certificates, this generalization seems
of dubious value.  Not having this generalization simply means that
the validity periods of certificates issued with the old CA key pair
cannot exceed the end of the "old with new" certificate validity
period.</t>
        <t>Note:  This scheme offers a mechanism to ensures that end entities
will acquire the new CA public key, at the latest by the expiry of
the last certificate they owned that was signed with the old CA
private key.  Certificate and/or key update operations occurring at
other times do not necessarily require this (depending on the end entity's equipment).</t>
        <t>Note:  In practice, a new root CA may have a slightly different subject
Distinguished Name (DN), e.g., indicating a generation identifier like the year of issuance or
a version number, for instance, in an Organizational Unit (OU) element.  How to bridge trust to
the new root CA certificate in a CA DN change or a cross-certificate scenario
is out of scope for this document.</t>
        <section anchor="sect-4.4.1">
          <name>CA Operator Actions</name>
          <t>To change the key of the CA, the CA operator does the following:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
              <t>Generate a new key pair.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Create a certificate containing the new CA public key signed with
  the new private key or by the private key of some other CA (the
  "new with new" certificate).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Optionally: Create a link certificate containing the new CA public
  key signed with the old private key (the "new with old"
  certificate).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Optionally: Create a link certificate containing the old CA public
  key signed with the new private key (the "old with new"
  certificate).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Publish these new certificates so that end entities may acquire
  it, e.g., using a repository or RootCaKeyUpdateContent.</t>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <t>The old CA private key is then no longer required when the validity
of the "old with old" certificate ended. However, the old
CA public key will remain in use for validating the "new with old"
link certificate until the new CA public key is loaded into the
trusted store. The old CA public key is no longer required (other
than for non-repudiation) when all end entities of this CA have
securely acquired and stored the new CA public key.</t>
          <t>The "new with new" certificate must have a validity period with a notBefore
time that is before the notAfter time of the "old with old" certificate and
a notAfter time that is after the notBefore time of the next update of this
certificate.</t>
          <t>The "new with old" certificate must have a validity period with the same
notBefore time as the "new with new" certificate and a notAfter time by which
all end entities of this CA will securely possess the new CA public key (at
the latest, at the notAfter time of the "old with old" certificate).</t>
          <t>The "old with new" certificate must have a validity period with the same
notBefore and notAfter time as the "old with old" certificate.</t>
          <t>Note:  Further operational considerations on transition from one root CA
self-signed certificate to the next is available in <xref section="5" target="RFC8649"/>.</t>

        <t>The EKU extension indicates the purposes for which the
certified key pair may be used. Therefore, it restricts the use of a certificate
to specific applications.</t>
        <t>A CA may want to delegate parts of its duties to other PKI management entities.
This section provides a mechanism to both prove this delegation and enable
automated means for checking the authorization of this delegation. Such delegation
may also be expressed by other means, e.g., explicit configuration.</t>
        <t>To offer automatic validation for the delegation of a role by a CA to another
entity, the certificates used for CMP message protection or signed data for
central key generation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be issued by the delegating CA and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain
the respective EKUs.  This proves that the delegating CA authorized this entity to act in the given role, as described below.</t>
        <t>The OIDs to be used for these EKUs are:</t>
        <sourcecode type="asn.1"><![CDATA[
  id-kp-cmcCA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
     iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)

]]></sourcecode>
        <t>Note: <xref section="2.10" target="RFC6402"/> specifies OIDs for a
	Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) CA and a CMC RA.
As the functionality of a CA and
RA is not specific to any protocol used for managing certificates (such as CMC or CMP),
these EKUs are reused by CMP.</t>
        <t>The meaning of the id-kp-cmKGA EKU is as follows:</t>
        <dl spacing="normal" newline="false">
          <dt>CMP KGA:</dt>
          <dd>
            <t>CMP KGAs are CAs or are identified by the id-kp-cmKGA
EKU.  The CMP KGA knows the private key it generated on behalf
of the end entity.  This is a very sensitive service and needs specific authorization,
which by default is with the CA certificate itself.  The CA may delegate
its authorization by placing the id-kp-cmKGA EKU in the certificate
used to authenticate the origin of the generated private key. The authorization
may also be determined through local configuration of the end entity.</t>

        <name>Overall PKI Message</name>
        <t>All of the messages used in this specification for the purposes of PKI management

        <t>The PKIProtection, when used, contains bits that protect the PKI
message.</t>
        <t>The extraCerts field can contain certificates that may be useful to
the recipient.  For example, this can be used by a CA or RA to
present an end entity with certificates that it needs to verify its
own new certificate (for example, if the CA that issued the end entity's
certificate is not a root CA for the end entity).  Note that
this field does not necessarily contain a certification path; the
recipient may have to sort, select from, or otherwise process the
extra certificates in order to use them.</t>

          <name>PKI Message Header</name>
          <t>All PKI messages require some header information for addressing and
transaction identification.  Some of this information will also be
present in a transport-specific envelope.  However, if the PKI

          <t>The usage of the protocol version number (pvno) is described in <xref target="sect-7"/>.</t>
          <t>The sender field contains the name of the sender of the PKIMessage.
This name (in conjunction with senderKID, if supplied) should be
sufficient to indicate the key to use to verify the protection on the
message.  If nothing about the sender is known to the sending entity
(e.g., in the initial request message, where the end entity may not know
its own DN, email name, IP address, etc.), then
the "sender" field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain a "NULL-DN" value in the directoryName choice.
A "NULL-DN" is a SEQUENCE OF relative DNs of zero length and is encoded as 0x3000.
In such a case, the senderKID field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> hold an identifier (i.e., a reference
number) that indicates to the receiver the appropriate shared secret
information to use to verify the message.</t>
          <t>The recipient field contains the name of the recipient of the
PKIMessage.  This name (in conjunction with recipKID, if supplied)
should be usable to verify the protection on the message.</t>
          <t>The protectionAlg field specifies the algorithm used to protect the
message.  If no protection bits are supplied (note that PKIProtection
is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>), then this field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be omitted; if protection bits are
supplied, then this field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be supplied.</t>
          <t>senderKID and recipKID are usable to indicate which keys have been
used to protect the message (recipKID will normally only be required
where protection of the message uses DH or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) keys).
These fields <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used if required to uniquely identify a key
(e.g., if more than one key is associated with a given sender name).
The senderKID <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used in any case.</t>
          <t>Note: The recommendation of using senderKID has changed since <xref target="RFC4210"/>,
where it was recommended to be omitted if not needed to identify the protection
key.</t>
          <t>The transactionID field within the message header is to be used to
allow the recipient of a message to correlate this with an ongoing
transaction.  This is needed for all transactions that consist of
more than just a single request/response pair.  For transactions that
consist of a single request/response pair, the rules are as follows.
A client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> populate the transactionID field if the message
contains an infoValue of type KemCiphertextInfo (see <xref target="sect-5.1.3.4"/>). In all other cases,
the client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> populate the transactionID field of the request.  If a
server receives such a request that has the transactionID field set,
then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set the transactionID field of the response to the same
value.  If a server receives such request with a missing
transactionID field, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> populate the transactionID field if
the message contains a KemCiphertextInfo field. In all other cases,
the server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> set the transactionID field of the response.</t>
          <t>For transactions that consist of more than just a single
request/response pair, the rules are as follows.  If the message
contains an infoValue of type KemCiphertextInfo, the client
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a transactionID; otherwise, the client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
generate a transactionID for the first request.  If a server receives
such a request that has the transactionID field set, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set
the transactionID field of the response to the same value.  If a
server receives such request with a missing transactionID field, then
it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> populate the transactionID field of the response with a
server-generated ID.  Subsequent requests and responses <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> all set
the transactionID field to the thus established value.  In all cases
where a transactionID is being used, a given client <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have
more than one transaction with the same transactionID in progress at
any time (to a given server).  Servers are free to require uniqueness
of the transactionID or not, as long as they are able to correctly
associate messages with the corresponding transaction.  Typically,
this means that a server will require the {client, transactionID}
tuple to be unique, or even the transactionID alone to be unique, if
it cannot distinguish clients based on any transport-level information.
A server receiving the first message of a transaction (which requires
more than a single request/response pair) that contains a
transactionID that does not allow it to meet the above constraints
(typically because the transactionID is already in use) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send
back an ErrorMsgContent with a PKIFailureInfo of transactionIdInUse.
It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the clients fill the transactionID field with
128 bits of (pseudo-)random data for the start of a transaction to
reduce the probability of having the transactionID in use at the
server.</t>
          <t>The senderNonce and recipNonce fields protect the PKIMessage against
replay attacks.  The senderNonce will typically be 128 bits of
(pseudo-)random data generated by the sender, whereas the recipNonce
is copied from the senderNonce field of the previous message in the
transaction.</t>
          <t>The messageTime field contains the time at which the sender created
the message.  This may be useful to allow end entities to
correct/check their local time for consistency with the time on a
	  central system.</t>
          <t>The freeText field may be used to send a human-readable message to
the recipient (in any number of languages).  Each UTF8String <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
include a language tag <xref target="RFC5646"/>  to indicate the language of the
contained text. The first language used in this sequence indicates
the desired language for replies.</t>
          <t>The generalInfo field may be used to send machine-processable
additional data to the recipient.  The following generalInfo
extensions are defined and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be supported.</t>

          <name>PKI Message Protection</name>
          <t>Some PKI messages will be protected for integrity.</t>
          <t>Note: If an asymmetric algorithm is used to protect a message and the relevant
public component has been certified already, then the origin of the
message can also be authenticated.  On the other hand, if the public
component is uncertified, then the message origin cannot be
automatically authenticated but may be authenticated via out-of-band
means.</t>
          <t>When protection is applied, the following structure is used:</t>
          <sourcecode type="asn.1"><![CDATA[
  PKIProtection ::= BIT STRING
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>The input to the calculation of PKIProtection is the DER encoding of
the following data structure:</t>
          <sourcecode type="asn.1"><![CDATA[
  ProtectedPart ::= SEQUENCE {
     header    PKIHeader,
     body      PKIBody
  }
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>There <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be cases in which the PKIProtection BIT STRING is
deliberately not used to protect a message (i.e., this <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> field
is omitted) because other protection, external to PKIX, will be
applied instead.  Such a choice is explicitly allowed in this
specification.  Examples of such external protection include CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/> and Security Multiparts <xref target="RFC1847"/> encapsulation of the
PKIMessage (or simply the PKIBody (omitting the CHOICE tag), if the
relevant PKIHeader information is securely carried in the external
mechanism).  It is noted, however, that many such external mechanisms
require that the end entity already possesses a public-key
certificate, a unique DN, and/or other such
infrastructure-related information.  Thus, they may not be
appropriate for initial registration, key-recovery, or any other
process with "bootstrapping" characteristics.  For those cases, it
may be necessary that the PKIProtection parameter be used.  In the
future, if/when external mechanisms are modified to accommodate
bootstrapping scenarios, the use of PKIProtection may become rare or
non-existent.</t>
          <t>Depending on the circumstances, the PKIProtection bits may contain a
MAC or signature.  Only the following
cases can occur:</t>
          <section anchor="sect-5.1.3.1">
            <name>Shared Secret Information</name>
            <t>In this case, the sender and recipient share secret information with sufficient
entropy (established via out-of-band means). PKIProtection will contain a
MAC value, and the protectionAlg <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be one of the options described in <xref section="6.1" target="RFC9481">CMP Algorithms</xref>.</t>
            <t>The algorithm identifier id-PasswordBasedMac is defined in <xref section="4.4" target="RFC4211"/> and updated by <xref target="RFC9045"/>.

It is recognized that this omission in <xref target="RFC4211"/> can lead to confusion and possible incompatibility if key expansion <xref target="RFC4210"/> is not used when needed. Therefore, when key expansion is required (when K &gt; H), the key expansion defined in the following text <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used.</t>
            <t>In the above protectionAlg, the salt value is appended to the shared
secret input. The OWF is then applied iterationCount times, where the
salted secret is the input to the first iteration and, for each
successive iteration, the input is set to be the output of the
previous iteration. The output of the final iteration (called
"BASEKEY" for ease of reference, with a size of "H") is what is used
to form the symmetric key. If the MAC algorithm requires a K-bit key
and K &lt;= H, then the most significant K bits of BASEKEY are used. If
K &gt; H, then all of BASEKEY is used for the most significant H bits of
the key, OWF("1" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most significant H
bits of the key, OWF("2" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most
significant H bits of the key, and so on, until all K bits have been
derived. [Here "N" is the ASCII byte encoding the number N and "||"

            <t>In case the sender of a message has a KEM key pair, it can be used to establish a shared secret key for MAC-based message protection. This can be used for message authentication.</t>
            <t>This approach uses the definition of KEM algorithm functions in <xref section="1" target="RFC9629"/> as follows:</t>
            <t>A KEM algorithm provides three functions:</t>

            <ol spacing="normal">
              <li>KeyGen() -&gt; (pk, sk): Generate a public key (pk) and a
              private (secret) key (sk).</li>
              <li>Encapsulate(pk) -&gt; (ct, ss): Given the public key
              (pk), produce a ciphertext (ct) and a shared secret (ss).</li>
              <li>Decapsulate(sk, ct) -&gt; (ss): Given the private key
              (sk) and the ciphertext (ct), produce the shared secret
              (ss).</li>
            </ol>

            <t>To support a particular KEM algorithm, the PKI entity that possesses a KEM key pair and wishes to use it for MAC-based message protection <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the KEM Decapsulate() function. The PKI entity that wishes to verify the MAC-based message protection <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the KEM Encapsulate() function. The respective public KEM key is usually carried in a certificate <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates"/>.</t>
            <t>Note: Both PKI entities send and receive messages in a PKI management operation. Both PKI entities may independently wish to protect messages using their KEM key pairs. For ease of explanation, we use the terms "Alice" to denote the PKI entity possessing the KEM key pair and who wishes to provide MAC-based message protection and "Bob" to denote the PKI entity having Alice's authentic public KEM key and who needs to verify the MAC-based protection provided by Alice.</t>
            <t>Assuming Bob has Alice's KEM public key, he generates the ciphertext using KEM encapsulation and transfers it to Alice in an InfoTypeAndValue structure. Alice then retrieves the KEM shared secret from the ciphertext using KEM decapsulation and the associated KEM private key. Using a key derivation function (KDF), Alice derives a shared secret key from the KEM shared secret and other data sent by Bob. PKIProtection will contain a MAC value calculated using that shared secret key, and the protectionAlg will be the following:</t>

Alternatively, the generalInfo field of the PKIHeader can be used to convey the same request and response InfoTypeAndValue structures, as described in <xref target="sect-5.1.1.5"/>. The procedure also works without Alice explicitly requesting the KEM ciphertext in case Bob knows one of Alice's KEM keys beforehand and can expect that she is ready to use it.</t>
            <t>If both the initiator and responder in a PKI management operation have KEM key pairs, this procedure can be applied by both entities independently, establishing and using different shared secret keys for either direction.</t>

        <name>Common Data Structures</name>
        <t>Before specifying the specific types that may be placed in a PKIBody,
we define some data structures that are used in more than one case.</t>
        <section anchor="sect-5.2.1">
          <name>Requested Certificate Contents</name>
          <t>Various PKI management messages require that the originator of the
message indicate some of the fields that are required to be present
in a certificate.  The CertTemplate structure allows entities requesting a certificate 
to specify the data fields that they want to be included. 
Typically, they are required to provide at least the publicKey field.
A CertTemplate structure is identical to a TBSCertificate structure (see <xref target="RFC5280"/>)  
but with all fields optional/situational.</t>
          <t>Note: Even if the originator completely specifies the contents of
a certificate it requires, a CA is free to modify fields within the
certificate actually issued.  If the modified certificate is
unacceptable to the requester, the requester <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send back a
certConf message that either does not include this certificate (via a
CertHash) or does include this certificate (via a CertHash) along
with a status of "rejected".  See <xref target="sect-5.3.18"/> for the definition
and use of CertHash and the certConf message.</t>
          <t>Note: Before requesting a new certificate, an end entity can request a certTemplate
structure as a kind of certificate request blueprint in order to learn which
data the CA expects to be present in the certificate request (see <xref target="sect-5.3.19.16"/>).</t>
          <t>See CRMF <xref target="RFC4211"/> for CertTemplate syntax.</t>
          <t>If certTemplate is an empty SEQUENCE (i.e., all fields omitted), then the
controls field in the CertRequest structure <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain the id-regCtrl-altCertTemplate
control, specifying a template for a certificate other than an X.509v3 public-key
certificate.  Conversely, if certTemplate is not empty (i.e., at least one
field is present), then controls <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain id-regCtrl-altCertTemplate.
The new control is defined as follows:</t>
          <sourcecode type="asn.1"><![CDATA[

   Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> for EnvelopedData syntax. Using the EncryptedKey data structure offers the
choice to either use EncryptedValue (for backward compatibility only) or

              <t>The end entity proves knowledge of the private key to the CA by providing the correct CertHash for this certificate in the certConf message. This demonstrates POP because the end entity can only compute the correct CertHash if it is able to recover the encrypted certificate, and it can only recover the certificate if it is able to obtain the symmetric key using the required private key. Clearly, for this to work, the CA <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> publish the certificate until the certConf message arrives (when certHash is to be used to demonstrate POP). See <xref target="sect-5.3.18"/> for further details, and see <xref target="sect-8.11"/> for security considerations regarding use of CT logs.</t>
              <t>The recipient <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> maintain a context of the PKI management operation, e.g., using transactionID and certReqId, to identify the private key to use when decrypting the EnvelopedData containing the newly issued certificate. The recipient may be unable to use the RecipientInfo structure as it refers to the certificate that is still encrypted. The sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> populate the rid field as specified by CMS, and the client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> ignore it.</t>

              <t>The direct method mentioned previously in <xref target="sect-4.3"/> demonstrates POP of the private key by having the end entity engage in a challenge-response protocol (using the messages popdecc of type POPODecKeyChall and popdecr of type POPODecKeyResp; see below) between CertReqMessages and CertRepMessage.

              <t>Note: This method would typically be used in an environment in which an RA verifies POP and then makes a certification request to the CA on behalf of the end entity.

            <name>Summary of POP Options</name>
            <t>The text in this section provides several options with respect to POP techniques. Using "SK" for "signing key", "EK" for "encryption key", "KAK" for "key agreement key", and "KEMK" for "key encapsulation mechanism key", the techniques may be summarized as follows:</t>

<ul empty="true" spacing="compact">
<li>   RAVerified;</li>
<li>   SKPOP;</li>
<li>   EKPOPThisMessage; -- deprecated</li>
<li>   KAKPOPThisMessage; -- deprecated</li>
<li>   EKPOPEncryptedKey;</li>
<li>   KAKPOPEncryptedKey;</li>
<li>   KEMKPOPEncryptedKey;</li>
<li>   KAKPOPThisMessageDHMAC;</li>
<li>   EKPOPEncryptedCert;</li>
<li>   KAKPOPEncryptedCert;</li>
<li>   KEMKPOPEncryptedCert;</li>
<li>   EKPOPChallengeResp;</li>
<li>   KAKPOPChallengeResp; and</li>
<li>   KEMKPOPChallengeResp.</li>
</ul>
            <t>Given this array of options, it is natural to ask how an end entity can know what is supported by the CA/RA (i.e., which options it may use when requesting certificates). The following guidelines should clarify this situation for end entity implementers.</t>

	    <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>RAVerified: This is not an end entity decision; the RA uses this if
              and only if it has verified POP before forwarding the request on
              to the CA, so it is not possible for the end entity to choose this
              technique.</li>
              <li>SKPOP: If the end entity has a signing key pair, this is the only POP
              method specified for use in the request for a corresponding
              certificate.</li>
              <li>EKPOPThisMessage (deprecated), KAKPOPThisMessage
              (deprecated), EKPOPEncryptedKey, KAKPOPEncryptedKey,
              KEMKPOPEncryptedKey: Whether or not to give up its private key
              to the CA/RA is an end entity decision. If the end entity decides to reveal its
              key, then these are the only POP methods available in this
              specification to achieve this (and the key pair type and
              protocol version used will determine which of these methods to
              use).  The reason for deprecating EKPOPThisMessage and
              KAKPOPThisMessage options has been given in <xref
              target="sect-5.2.8.3.1"/>.</li>
              <li>KAKPOPThisMessageDHMAC: The end entity can only use this method if
              (1) the CA/RA has a DH certificate available for this purpose
              and (2) the end entity already has a copy of this certificate. If both
              these conditions hold, then this technique is clearly supported
              and may be used by the end entity, if desired.</li>
              <li>EKPOPEncryptedCert, KAKPOPEncryptedCert,
              KEMKPOPEncryptedCert, EKPOPChallengeResp, KAKPOPChallengeResp,
              and KEMKPOPChallengeResp: The end entity picks one of these (in the
              subsequentMessage field) in the request message, depending upon
              preference and key pair type. The end entity is not doing POP at this
              point; it is simply indicating which method it wants to
              use. Therefore, if the CA/RA replies with a "badPOP" error, the
              end entity can re-request using the other POP method chosen in
              subsequentMessage. Note, however, that this specification
              encourages the use of the EncryptedCert choice and, furthermore,
              says that the challenge-response would typically be used when an
              RA is involved and doing POP verification. Thus, the end entity should
              be able to make an intelligent decision regarding which of these
              POP methods to choose in the request message.</li>

benefit of this approach is that a CA may reply with a certificate
even in the absence of proof that the requester is the end entity
that can use the relevant private key (note that the proof is not
obtained until the certConf message is received by the CA).  Thus,

<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be computed using the same hash algorithm as used to create and verify

      <name>Mandatory PKI Management Functions</name>
      <t>Some of the PKI management functions outlined in <xref target="sect-3.1"/> are
described in this section.</t>
      <t>This section deals with functions that are "mandatory" in the sense
that all end entity and CA/RA implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to provide
the functionality described.  This part is effectively the profile of
the PKI management functionality that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be supported.  Note,
however, that the management functions described in this section do
not need to be accomplished using the PKI messages defined in <xref target="sect-5"/>
if alternate means are suitable for a given environment. See
<xref section="7" target="RFC9483"/> and <xref target="sect-c"/> for profiles of the PKIMessage structures
that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be supported for specific use cases.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-6.1">
        <name>Root CA Initialization</name>
        <t>[See <xref target="sect-3.1.1.2"/> for this document's definition of "root CA".]</t>
        <t>If a newly created root CA is at the top of a PKI hierarchy, it usually
produces a "self-certificate", which is a
certificate structure with the profile defined for the "newWithNew"
certificate issued following a root CA key update.</t>
        <t>In order to make the CA's self-certificate useful to end entities
that do not acquire the self-certificate via "out-of-band" means, the
CA must also produce a fingerprint for its certificate.  End entities
that acquire this fingerprint securely via some "out-of-band" means
can then verify the CA's self-certificate and, hence, the other
attributes contained therein.</t>
        <t>The data structure used to carry the fingerprint may be the OOBCertHash (see <xref target="sect-5.2.5"/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-6.2">
        <name>Root CA Key Update</name>
        <t>CA keys (as all other keys) have a finite lifetime and will have to
be updated on a periodic basis.  The certificates NewWithNew,
NewWithOld, and OldWithNew (see <xref target="sect-4.4.1"/>) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be issued by the
CA to aid existing end entities who hold the current root CA
certificate (OldWithOld) to transition securely to the new root
CA certificate (NewWithNew) and to aid new end entities who
will hold NewWithNew to acquire OldWithOld securely for verification
of existing data.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-6.3">
        <name>Subordinate CA Initialization</name>
        <t>[See <xref target="sect-3.1.1.2"/> for this document's definition of "subordinate CA".]</t>
        <t>From the perspective of PKI management protocols, the initialization of a
subordinate CA is the same as the initialization of an end entity.  The only
difference is that the subordinate CA must also produce an initial revocation
list.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-6.4">
        <name>CRL Production</name>
        <t>Before issuing any certificates, a newly established CA (which issues
CRLs) must produce "empty" versions of each CRL, which are to be
periodically produced.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-6.5">
        <name>PKI Information Request</name>
        <t>When a PKI entity (CA, RA, or end entity) wishes to acquire information about
the current status of a CA, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> send that CA a request for such
information.</t>
        <t>The CA <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> respond to the request by providing (at least) all of the
information requested by the requester.  If some of the information
cannot be provided, then an error must be conveyed to the requester.</t>
        <t>If PKIMessages are used to request and supply this PKI information,
then the request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the GenMsg message, the response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the
GenRep message, and the error <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the Error message.  These
messages are protected using a MAC based on shared secret information
(e.g., password-based MAC; see <xref section="6.1" target="RFC9481">"CMP Algorithms"</xref>) or using any asymmetric authentication means such as a
signature (if the end entity has an existing certificate).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-6.6">
        <name>Cross-Certification</name>
        <t>The requester CA is the CA that will become the subject of the
cross-certificate; the responder CA will become the issuer of the
cross-certificate.</t>
        <t>The requester CA must be "up and running" before initiating the
cross-certification operation.</t>
        <section anchor="sect-6.6.1">
          <name>One-Way Request-Response Scheme</name>
          <t>The cross-certification scheme is essentially a one-way operation;
that is, when successful, this operation results in the creation of
one new cross-certificate.  If the requirement is that cross-certificates
be created in "both directions", then each CA, in turn,
must initiate a cross-certification operation (or use another
scheme).</t>
          <t>This scheme is suitable where the two CAs in question can already
verify each other's signatures (they have some common points of
trust) or where there is an out-of-band verification of the origin of
the certification request.</t>

          <t indent="3">Cross-certification is initiated at one CA known as the responder.
The CA administrator for the responder identifies the CA it wants to
cross-certify and the responder CA equipment generates an
authorization code.  The responder CA administrator passes this
authorization code by out-of-band means to the requester CA
administrator.  The requester CA administrator enters the
authorization code at the requester CA in order to initiate the
online exchange.</t>
          <t indent="3">The authorization code is used for authentication and integrity
purposes.  This is done by generating a symmetric key based on the
authorization code and using the symmetric key for generating MACs on all messages exchanged.
(Authentication may alternatively be done using signatures instead of
MACs, if the CAs are able to retrieve and validate the required
public keys by some means, such as an out-of-band hash comparison.)</t>
          <t indent="3">The requester CA initiates the exchange by generating a cross-certification
request (ccr) with a fresh random number (requester random number).
The requester CA then sends the ccr message to the responder CA.
The fields in this message are protected from modification with a
MAC based on the authorization code.</t>
          <t indent="3">Upon receipt of the ccr message, the responder CA validates the
message and the MAC, saves the requester random number, and generates
its own random number (responder random number).  It then generates
(and archives, if desired) a new requester certificate that contains
the requester CA public key and is signed with the responder CA
signature private key.  The responder CA responds with the cross-certification response (ccp) message.  The fields in this message are
protected from modification with a MAC based on the authorization
code.</t>
          <t indent="3">Upon receipt of the ccp message, the requester CA validates the
message (including the received random numbers) and the MAC.  The
requester CA responds with the certConf message.  The fields in this
message are protected from modification with a MAC based on the
authorization code.  The requester CA <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> write the requester
certificate to the Repository as an aid to later certificate path
construction.</t>
          <t indent="3">Upon receipt of the certConf message, the responder CA validates the
message and the MAC and sends back an acknowledgement using the
pkiconf message.  It <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also publish the requester certificate as
an aid to later path construction.</t>
          <t>Notes:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
              <t>The ccr message must contain a "complete" certification request;
  that is, all fields except the serial number (including, e.g., a
  BasicConstraints extension) must be specified by the requester
  CA.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The ccp message <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> contain the verification certificate of
  the responder CA; if present, the requester CA must then verify
  this certificate (for example, via the "out-of-band" mechanism).</t>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <t>(A simpler, non-interactive model of cross-certification may also be
envisioned, in which the issuing CA acquires the subject CA's public
key from some repository, verifies it via some out-of-band mechanism,
and creates and publishes the cross-certificate without the subject
CA's explicit involvement.  This model may be perfectly legitimate
for many environments, but since it does not require any protocol
message exchanges, its detailed description is outside the scope of
this specification.)</t>

it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send a PKIMessage with the highest version supported by both it and
the server.  If a client does not know what version(s) the server supports,

the following exception: Version cmp2021 <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only be used if cmp2021 syntax
is needed for the request being sent or for the expected response.</t>
      <t>Note: Using cmp2000 as the default pvno value is done to avoid extra
  message exchanges for version negotiation and to foster compatibility
  with cmp2000 implementations.
Version cmp2021 syntax is only needed if a message exchange uses EnvelopedData,
hashAlg (in CertStatus), POPOPrivKey with agreeMAC, or ckuann with RootCaKeyUpdateContent.</t>
      <t>If a server receives a message with a version that it supports, then
the version of the response message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the same as the received

        <name>On the Necessity of POP</name>
        <t>It is well established that the role of a CA is to
verify that the name and public key belong to the end entity prior to
issuing a certificate. If an entity holding a private key obtains a certificate containing the corresponding public key issued for a different entity, it can authenticate as the entity named in the certificate. This facilitates masquerading. It is not entirely clear what security guarantees are lost if an end entity is able to obtain a certificate containing a public key that they do not possess the corresponding private key for. There are some scenarios,
described as "forwarding attacks" in Appendix A of <xref target="Gueneysu"/>, in
which this can lead to protocol attacks against a naively implemented
sign-then-encrypt protocol, but in general, it merely results in the
end entity obtaining a certificate that they cannot use.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-8.2">
        <name>POP with a Decryption Key</name>
        <t>Some cryptographic considerations are worth explicitly spelling out.
In the protocols specified above, when an end entity is required to
prove possession of a decryption key, it is effectively challenged to
decrypt something (its own certificate).  This scheme (and many
others!) could be vulnerable to an attack if the possessor of the
decryption key in question could be fooled into decrypting an
arbitrary challenge and returning the cleartext to an attacker.
Although in this specification a number of other failures in security
are required in order for this attack to succeed, it is conceivable
that some future services (e.g., notary, trusted time) could
potentially be vulnerable to such attacks.  For this reason, we
reiterate the general rule that implementations should be very careful
about decrypting arbitrary "ciphertext" and revealing recovered
"plaintext" since such a practice can lead to serious security
vulnerabilities.</t>
        <t>The client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return the decrypted values only if they match the expected content type. In an indirect method, the decrypted value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a valid certificate, and in a direct method, the decrypted value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a Rand as defined in <xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.3"/>.</t>

        <t>A small subgroup attack during a DH key exchange may be

choose DH parameters that enable it to derive (a significant
number of bits of) the DH private key of the CA during a key
archival or key recovery operation.  Armed with this knowledge, the
end entity would then be able to retrieve the decryption private key of
another unsuspecting end entity, EE2, during EE2's legitimate key
archival or key recovery operation with that CA.  In order to avoid
the possibility of such an attack, two courses of action are
available.  (1) The CA may generate a fresh DH key pair to be used
as a protocol encryption key pair for each end entity with which it
interacts.  (2) The CA may enter into a key validation protocol (not
specified in this document) with each requesting end entity to ensure
that the end entity's protocol encryption key pair will not facilitate this
attack.  Option (1) is clearly simpler (requiring no extra protocol

When transferring encrypted long-term confidential values such as centrally generated private keys or revocation passphrases, pfs is likely important.
Yet, it is not needed for CMP message protection providing integrity and authenticity because transfer of PKI messages is usually completed in very limited time.
For the same reason, it is not typically required for the indirect method to provide a POP (<xref target="sect-5.2.8.3.2"/>) delivering the newly issued certificate in encrypted form.</t>
        <t>Encrypted values (<xref target="sect-5.2.2"/>) are transferred using CMS EnvelopedData <xref target="RFC5652"/>, which does not offer pfs.

        <name>Entropy of Random Numbers, Key Pairs, and Shared Secret Information</name>
        <t>Implementations must generate nonces and private keys from random input.
The use of inadequate pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate
cryptographic keys can result in little or no security. An attacker may find
it much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys and
to search the resulting small set of possibilities than brute-force searching the whole key space. As an example of predictable random numbers, see <xref target="CVE-2008-0166"/>; consequences of low-entropy random numbers are discussed in <xref target="MiningPsQs">Mining Your Ps and Qs</xref>. The generation of quality random numbers is difficult. <xref target="ISO.20543-2019">ISO/IEC 20543:2019</xref>, <xref target="NIST.SP.800_90Ar1">NIST SP 800-90A Rev.1</xref>, <xref target="AIS31">BSI AIS 31 V2.0</xref>, and other specifications offer valuable guidance in this area.</t>
        <t>If shared secret information is generated by a cryptographically secure random number
generator (CSRNG), it is safe to assume that the entropy of the shared secret
information equals its bit length. If no CSRNG is used, the entropy of
shared secret information depends on the details of the generation process
and cannot be measured securely after it has been generated.
  If user-generated passwords are used as shared secret information,
  their entropy cannot be measured. Passwords generated from user-supplied entropy
  are typically insufficient for protected delivery of
  centrally generated keys or trust anchors.</t>
        <t>If the entropy of shared secret information protecting the delivery of
a centrally generated key pair is known, it should not be less than the security
strength of that key pair; if the shared secret information is reused for
different key pairs, the security of the shared secret information should
exceed the security strength of each individual key pair.</t>
        <t>For the case of a PKI management operation that delivers a new trust anchor
(e.g., a root CA certificate), using caPubs or genp that is (a) not concluded
in a timely manner or (b) where the shared secret information is reused
for several key management operations, the entropy of the shared secret information,
if known, should not be less than the security strength of the trust anchor
being managed by the operation. The shared secret information should have
an entropy that at least matches the security strength of the key material
being managed by the operation. Certain use cases may require shared secret
information that may be of a low security strength, e.g., a human-generated
password. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that such secret information be limited to a
single PKI management operation.</t>

        <name>Recurring Usage of KEM Keys for Message Protection</name>
        <t>For each PKI management operation using MAC-based message protection involving KEM (see <xref target="sect-5.1.3.4"/>), the KEM Encapsulate() function, providing a fresh KEM ciphertext (ct) and shared secret (ss), <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be invoked.</t>
        <t>It is assumed that the overall data size of the CMP messages
in a PKI management operation protected by a single shared secret key
is small enough not to introduce extra security risks.</t>
        <t>To be appropriate for use with this specification, the KEM algorithm
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> explicitly be designed to be secure when the public key is used
many times. For example, a KEM algorithm with a single-use public
key is not appropriate because the public key is expected to be
carried in a long-lived certificate <xref target="RFC5280"/> and used over and over.
Thus, KEM algorithms that offer indistinguishability under adaptive
chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) security are appropriate. A
common design pattern for obtaining IND-CCA2 security with public key
reuse is to apply the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform <xref target="Fujisaki"/> or a
variant of the FO transform <xref target="Hofheinz"/>.</t>
        <t>Therefore, given a long-term public key using an IND-CCA2-secure KEM

      <name>Reasons for the Presence of RAs</name>
      <t>The reasons that justify the presence of an RA can be split into
those that are due to technical factors and those that are
organizational in nature.  Technical reasons include the following.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>If hardware tokens are in use, then not all end entities will have
the equipment needed to initialize these; the RA equipment can
include the necessary functionality (this may also be a matter of
policy).</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Some end entities may not have the capability to publish
certificates; again, the RA may be suitably placed for this.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The RA will be able to issue signed revocation requests on behalf
of end entities associated with it, whereas the end entity may not
be able to do this (if the key pair is completely lost).</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>Some of the organizational reasons that argue for the presence of an
RA are the following.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>It may be more cost effective to concentrate functionality in the
RA equipment than to supply functionality to all end entities
(especially if special token initialization equipment is to be
used).</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Establishing RAs within an organization can reduce the number of
CAs required, which is sometimes desirable.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>RAs may be better placed to identify people with their
"electronic" names, especially if the CA is physically remote from
the end entity.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>For many applications, there will already be some
administrative structure in place so that candidates for the role of RA are
easy to find (which may not be true of the CA).</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>Further reasons relevant for automated machine-to-machine certificate lifecycle
management are available in the Lightweight CMP Profile <xref target="RFC9483"/>.</t>

      <name>The Use of Revocation Passphrase</name>
      <t>A revocation request must incorporate suitable security mechanisms,
including proper authentication, in order to reduce the probability
of successful denial-of-service attacks.  A digital signature or DH/KEM-based message protection on the
request -- <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> to support within this specification depending on the key type used if
revocation requests are supported -- can provide the authentication
required, but there are circumstances under which an alternative
mechanism may be desirable (e.g., when the private key is no longer
accessible and the entity wishes to request a revocation prior to
re-certification of another key pair).  In order to accommodate such
circumstances, a password-based MAC (see <xref section="6.1" target="RFC9481">CMP Algorithms</xref>) on the request is also <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> to
support within this specification (subject to local security policy
for a given environment) if revocation requests are supported and if
shared secret information can be established between the requester
and the responder prior to the need for revocation.</t>
      <t>A mechanism that has seen use in some environments is "revocation passphrase",
in which a value of sufficient entropy (i.e., a
relatively long passphrase rather than a short password) is shared
between (only) the entity and the CA/RA at some point prior to
revocation; this value is later used to authenticate the revocation
request.</t>
      <t>In this specification, the following technique to establish shared
secret information (i.e., a revocation passphrase) is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> to
support.  Its precise use in CMP messages is as follows.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>The OID and value specified in <xref target="sect-5.3.19.9"/> <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be sent in a GenMsg message
at any time or <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be sent in the generalInfo
field of the PKIHeader of any PKIMessage at any time.  (In particular, the
EncryptedKey structure as described in <xref target="sect-5.2.2"/> may be sent in the header
of the certConf message that confirms acceptance
of certificates requested in an initialization request or certificate request
message.)  This conveys a revocation passphrase chosen by the entity to the
relevant CA/RA. When EnvelopedData is used, this is in the decrypted bytes
of the encryptedContent field. When EncryptedValue is used, this is in the decrypted
bytes of the encValue field. Furthermore, the transfer is accomplished with
appropriate confidentiality characteristics.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>If a CA/RA receives the revocation passphrase (OID and value
specified in <xref target="sect-5.3.19.9"/>) in a GenMsg, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> construct and
send a GenRep message that includes the OID (with absent value)
specified in <xref target="sect-5.3.19.9"/>. If the CA/RA receives the
revocation passphrase in the generalInfo field of a PKIHeader of
any PKIMessage, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the OID (with absent value) in the
generalInfo field of the PKIHeader of the corresponding response
PKIMessage.  If the CA/RA is unable to return the appropriate
response message for any reason, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send an error message
with a status of "rejection" and, optionally, a failInfo reason
set.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Either the localKeyId attribute of EnvelopedData as specified in
<xref target="RFC2985"/> or the valueHint field of EncryptedValue <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
contain a key identifier (chosen
by the entity, along with the passphrase itself) to assist in later retrieval
of the correct passphrase (e.g., when the revocation request is constructed
by the end entity and received by the CA/RA).</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The revocation request message is protected by a password-based MAC (see
<xref section="6.1" target="RFC9481">"CMP Algorithms"</xref>)
with the revocation passphrase as the key.  If appropriate, the
senderKID field in the PKIHeader <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain the value previously
transmitted in localKeyId or valueHint.</t>

      </ul>
      <t>Note: For a message transferring a revocation passphrase indicating cmp2021(3) in the pvno field of the PKIHeader, the encrypted passphrase <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be transferred in the envelopedData choice of EncryptedKey as defined in <xref target="sect-5.2.2"/>.  When using cmp2000(2) in the message header for backward compatibility, the encryptedValue is used. This allows the necessary conveyance and protection of the passphrase while maintaining bits-on-the-wire compatibility with <xref target="RFC4210"/>. The encryptedValue choice has been deprecated in favor of encryptedData.</t>
      <t>Using the technique specified above, the revocation passphrase may be
initially established and updated at any time without requiring extra
messages or out-of-band exchanges.  For example, the revocation
request message itself (protected and authenticated through a MAC
that uses the revocation passphrase as a key) may contain, in the
PKIHeader, a new revocation passphrase to be used for authenticating
future revocation requests for any of the entity's other
certificates.  In some environments, this may be preferable to
mechanisms that reveal the passphrase in the revocation request
message, since this can allow a denial-of-service attack in which the
revealed passphrase is used by an unauthorized third party to
authenticate revocation requests on the entity's other certificates.
However, because the passphrase is not revealed in the request
message, there is no requirement that the passphrase must always be
updated when a revocation request is made (that is, the same
passphrase <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used by an entity to authenticate revocation
requests for different certificates at different times).</t>
      <t>Furthermore, the above technique can provide strong cryptographic
protection over the entire revocation request message even when a
digital signature is not used.  Techniques that do authentication of
the revocation request by simply revealing the revocation passphrase
typically do not provide cryptographic protection over the fields of
the request message (so that a request for revocation of one
certificate may be modified by an unauthorized third party to a
request for revocation of another certificate for that entity).</t>

            <t>A "special" X.500 DN is called the "NULL-DN"; this means a DN

          <li>
            <t>Where a GeneralName is required for a field, but no suitable
  value is available (e.g., an end entity produces a request before
  knowing its name), then the GeneralName is to be an X.500 NULL-DN
  (i.e., the Name field of the CHOICE is to contain a NULL-DN).</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Where a profile omits to specify the value for a GeneralName,
  then the NULL-DN value is to be present in the relevant
  PKIMessage field.  This occurs with the sender field of the
  PKIHeader for some messages.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Where any ambiguity arises due to naming of fields, the profile
  names these using a "dot" notation (e.g., "certTemplate.subject"

          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Where a "SEQUENCE OF types" is part of a message, a zero-based

  is not included in some of the profiles given since its body is
  NULL and its header contents are clear from the context.  Any

        <name>In-Band Initialization Using External Identity Certificate</name>
        <t>An (uninitialized) end entity wishes to initialize into the PKI with
a CA, CA-1.  It uses, for authentication purposes, a pre-existing
identity certificate issued by another (external) CA, CA-X.  A trust
relationship must already have been established between CA-1 and CA-X
so that CA-1 can validate the end entity identity certificate signed by CA-X.
Furthermore, some mechanism must already have been established within
the TEE, also known as
PSE, of the end entity that would allow it
to authenticate and verify PKIMessages signed by CA-1 (as one
example, the TEE may contain a certificate issued for the public key
of CA-1, signed by another CA that the end entity trusts on the basis of
out-of-band authentication techniques).</t>
        <t>The end entity sends an initialization request to start the transaction.
When CA-1 responds with a message containing the new certificate, the
end entity replies with a certificate confirmation.  CA-1 replies
with a pkiconf message to close the transaction.  All messages are signed
(the end entity messages are signed using the private key that corresponds to
the public key in its external identity certificate; the CA-1
messages are signed using the private key that corresponds to the
public key in a certificate that can be chained to a trust anchor in the end entity's TEE).</t>

      <name>Variants of Using KEM Keys for PKI Message Protection</name>
      <t>As described in <xref target="sect-5.1.3.4"/>, any party in a PKI management operation may wish to use a KEM key pair for message protection. Possible cases are described below.</t>
      <t>For any PKI management operation started by a PKI entity with any type of request message, the following message flows describe the use of a KEM key. There are two cases to distinguish, namely whether the PKI entity or the PKI management entity owns a KEM key pair. If both sides own KEM key pairs, the flows need to be combined such that for each direction a shared secret key is established.</t>
      <t>In the following message flows, Alice indicates the PKI entity that uses a KEM key pair for message authentication and Bob provides the KEM ciphertext using Alice's public KEM key, as described in <xref target="sect-5.1.3.4"/>.</t>
