      <t>This document specifies a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option that is used to
      record the Minimum Path MTU (PMTU) along the forward path between a source host
      to a destination host. The recorded value can then be communicated back
      to the source using the return Path MTU field in the Option.</t>

    <section anchor="Intro" numbered="true" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>This document specifies a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Option to record the
      minimum Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) along the forward path between a
      source and a destination host. The source host creates a packet with
      this Option and initializes the Min-PMTU field with the value of the MTU
      for the outbound link that will be used to forward the packet towards
      the destination host.</t>

      <t>At each subsequent hop where the Option is processed, the router
      compares the value of the Min-PMTU field in the Option and the MTU of
      its outgoing link. If the MTU of the link is less than the Min-PMTU, it
      rewrites the value in the Option Data with the smaller value. When the
      packet arrives at the destination host, the host can send the value of
      the minimum Reported MTU for the path back to the source host using the
      Rtn-PMTU field in the Option. The source host can then use this value as
      input to the method that sets the Path MTU (PMTU) used by upper-layer
      protocols.</t>

      <t>The IPv6 Minimum Path MTU Hop-by-Hop (MinPMTU HBH) Option
      is designed to work with packet sizes that can be
      specified in the IPv6 header. The maximum packet size that can be
      specified in an IPv6 header is 65,535 octets (2<sup>16</sup>).</t>

      <t>This method has the potential to complete Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) in a
      single round-trip time, even over paths that have successive links, each
      with a lower MTU.</t>

      <t>The mechanism defined in this document is focused on unicast; it does
      not describe multicast. That is left for future work.</t>

      <section anchor="Intro1" numbered="true" title="Example Operation"
               toc="default">
        <t>The figure below illustrates the operation of the method. In this
        case, the path between the source host and the destination host
        comprises three links: the source has a link MTU of size MTU-S, the
        link between routers R1 and R2 has an MTU of size 9000 bytes, and the
        final link to the destination has an MTU of size MTU-D.</t>

        <t>Three scenarios are described:</t>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Scenario 1 considers all links to have a 9000 byte MTU, and
            the method is supported by both routers. The initial Min-PMTU is
            not modified along the path. Therefore, the PMTU is 9000
            bytes.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Scenario 2 considers the link between R2 and the destination host
            (MTU-D) to have an MTU of 1500 bytes. This is the smallest MTU.
            Router R2 updates the Min-PMTU to 1500 bytes, and the method
            correctly updates the PMTU to 1500 bytes. Had there been another
            smaller MTU at a link further along the path that also supports
            the method, the lower MTU would also have been detected.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Scenario 3 considers the case where the router preceding the
            smallest link (R2) does not support the method, and the link to
            the destination host (MTU-D) has an MTU of 1500 bytes. Therefore,
            router R2 does not update the Min-PMTU to 1500 bytes. The method
            then fails to detect the actual PMTU.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <t>In Scenarios 2 and 3, a lower PMTU would also fail to be detected
        in the case where PMTUD had been used and an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big
        (PTB) message had not been delivered to the sender <xref
        format="default" target="RFC8201" />.</t>

        <t>These scenarios are summarized in the table below. "H" in R1 and/or
        R2 columns means the router understands the MinPMTU HBH Option.</t>

      <section anchor="Intro2" numbered="true"
               title="Use of the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Header" toc="default">
        <t>As specified in <xref format="default" target="RFC8200"/>, IPv6
        allows nodes to optionally process the Hop-by-Hop header.
        Specifically, from <xref target="RFC8200" sectionFormat="of" section="4"
	format="default"/>:</t>

          <blockquote>
            <t>The Hop-by-Hop Options header is not inserted or deleted, but
            may be examined or processed by any node along a packet's delivery
            path, until the packet reaches the node (or each of the set of
            nodes, in the case of multicast) identified in the Destination
            Address field of the IPv6 header. The Hop-by-Hop Options header,
            when present, must immediately follow the IPv6 header. Its
            presence is indicated by the value zero in the Next Header field
            of the IPv6 header.</t>

            <t>NOTE: While <xref format="default" target="RFC2460" /> required
            that all nodes must examine and process the Hop-by-Hop Options
            header, it is now expected that nodes along a packet's delivery
            path only examine and process the Hop-by-Hop Options header if
            explicitly configured to do so.</t>
          </blockquote>

        <t>The Hop-by-Hop Option defined in this document is designed to take
        advantage of this property of how Hop-by-Hop Options are processed.
        Nodes that do not support this Option <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> ignore them. This can
        mean that the Min-PMTU value does not account for all links along a
        path.</t>

    <section anchor="motivation" numbered="true"
             title="Motivation and Problem Solved" toc="default">
      <t>The current state of Path MTU Discovery on the Internet is
      problematic. The mechanisms defined in <xref format="default"
      target="RFC8201" /> are known to not work well in all environments. It
      fails to work in various cases, including when nodes in the middle of
      the network do not send ICMPv6 PTB messages or rate-limited ICMPv6
      messages or do not have a return path to the source host. This results in many transport-layer connections being configured to
      use smaller packets (e.g., 1280 bytes) by default and makes it difficult
      to take advantage of paths with a larger PMTU where they do exist.
      Applications that send large packets are forced to use IPv6
      fragmentation <xref format="default" target="RFC8200" />, which can
      reduce the reliability of Internet communication <xref format="default"
      target="RFC8900" />.</t>

      <t>Encapsulations and network-layer tunnels further reduce the payload
      size available for a transport protocol to use. Also, some use cases
      increase packet overhead, for example, Network Virtualization Using
      Generic Routing Encapsulation (NVGRE) <xref format="default"
      target="RFC7637" /> encapsulates Layer 2 (L2) packets in an outer IP header and
      does not allow IP fragmentation.</t>

      <t>Sending larger packets can improve host performance, e.g., avoiding
      limits to packet processing by the packet rate. An example of this is how the
      packet-per-second
      rate required to reach wire speed on a 10G link with 1280
      byte packets is about 977K packets per second (pps) vs. 139K pps for
      9000 byte packets.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this document is to improve the situation by defining
      a mechanism that does not rely on reception of ICMPv6 PTB
      messages from nodes in the middle of the network. Instead, this provides
      information to the destination host about the Minimum Path MTU and
      sends this information back to the source host. This is expected to work
      better than the current mechanisms based on <xref target="RFC8201"
      format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>A similar mechanism was proposed in 1988 for IPv4 in <xref
      format="default" target="RFC1063" /> by Jeff Mogul, C. Kent, Craig
      Partridge, and Keith McCloghire. It was later obsoleted in 1990 by <xref
      format="default" target="RFC1191" />, which is the current deployed approach to
      Path MTU Discovery. In contrast, the method described in this document
      uses the Hop-by-Hop Option of IPv6. It does not replace PMTUD <xref
      format="default" target="RFC8201" />, Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery
      (PLPMTUD) <xref format="default"
      target="RFC4821" />, or Datagram Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD) <xref format="default"
      target="RFC8899" /> but rather is designed to compliment these
      methods.</t>

      <t>The Path MTU Option is designed for environments where there is
      control over the hosts and nodes that connect them and where there is
      more than one MTU size in use, for example, in data centers and on paths
      between data centers to allow hosts to better take advantage of a path
      that is able to support a large PMTU.</t>

      <t>The design of the Option is so sufficiently simple that it can be
      executed on a router's fast path. A successful experiment depends on
      both implementation by host and router vendors and deployment by
      operators. The contained use case of connections within and between data
      centers could be a driver for deployment.</t>

      <t>The method could also be useful in other environments, including the
      general Internet, and offers an advantage when this Hop-by-Hop Option is
      supported on all paths. The method is more robust when used to probe the
      path using packets that do not carry application data and when also
      paired with a method like Packetization Layer PMTUD <xref

        <t>This Hop-by-Hop Option is intended to be used with a Path MTU
        Discovery method.</t>

        <t>PLPMTUD <xref format="default" target="RFC8899" /> uses probe
        packets for two distinct functions:</t>

        <ul>
          <li>Probe packets are used to confirm connectivity. Such probes can
          be of any size up to the Packetization Layer Path MTU (PLPMTU). These
	  probe packets are sent to
          solicit a response using the path to the remote node. These probe
          packets can carry the Hop-by-Hop PMTU Option, providing the final
          size of the packet does not exceed the current PLPMTU. After
          validating that the packet originates from the path (<xref target="RFC8899"
	  section="4.6.1" sectionFormat="of"/>),
          the PLPMTUD method can use the reported size from the Hop-by-Hop Option as
          the next search point when it resumes the search algorithm. (This
          use resembles the use of the PTB_SIZE information in <xref format="default"
	  target="RFC8899" section="4.6.2" sectionFormat="of"/>.)</li>

          <li>A second use of probe packets is to explore if a path supports a
          packet size greater than the current PLPMTU. If this probe packet is
          successfully delivered (as determined by the source host), then the
          PLPMTU is raised to the size of the successful probe. These probe
          packets do not usually set the Path MTU Hop-by-Hop Option. See
          <xref target="RFC8899" section="1.2" sectionFormat="of"/>. <xref
	  format="default" target="RFC8899" section="4.1" sectionFormat="of"/> also
	  describes ways that a probe packet can be constructed, depending on whether
          the probe packets carry application data.</li>
	</ul>
	  
          <t>The PMTU Hop-by-Hop Option probe can be sent on packets that
          include application data but needs to be robust to potential loss
          of the packet (i.e., with the possibility that retransmission might
          be needed if the packet is lost).</t>

          <t>Using a PMTU probe on packets that do not carry application data
          will avoid the need for loss recovery if a router on the path drops
          packets that set this Option. (This avoids the transport needing to
          retransmit a lost packet that includes this Option.) This is the
          normal default format for both uses of probes.</t>

                 toc="default">
          <t>The upper-layer protocol can request the MinPMTU HBH Option
          to be included in an outgoing IPv6 packet. A transport protocol (or
          upper-layer protocol) can include this Option only on specific
          packets used to test the path. This Option does not need to be
          included in all packets belonging to a flow.</t>

          <t>NOTE: Including this Option in a large packet (e.g., one larger
          than the present PMTU) is not likely to be useful, since the large
          packet would itself be dropped by any link along the path with a
          smaller MTU, preventing the Min-PMTU information from reaching the
          destination host.</t>

          <t>Discussion:</t>

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>In the case of TCP, the Option could be included in a packet
              that carries a TCP segment sent after the connection is
              established. A segment without data could be used to avoid the
              need to retransmit this data if the probe packet is lost. The
              discovered value can be used to inform PLPMTUD <xref
              format="default" target="RFC4821" />.</t>

              <t>NOTE: A TCP SYN can also negotiate the Maximum Segment Size
              (MSS), which acts as an upper limit to the packet size that can
              be sent by a TCP sender. If this Option were to be included in a
              TCP SYN, it could increase the probability that the SYN segment
              is lost when routers on the path drop packets with this Option
              (see <xref target="HBHblackhole" />), which could have an
              unwanted impact on the result of racing Options <xref
              format="default" target="I-D.ietf-taps-arch" /> or feature
              negotiation.</t>
            </li>

            <li>
              <t>The use with datagram transport protocols (e.g., UDP) is
              harder to characterize because applications using datagram
              transports range from very short-lived (low data-volume
              applications) exchanges to longer (bulk) exchanges of packets
              between the source and destination hosts <xref format="default"
              target="RFC8085" />.</t>
            </li>

            <li>
              <t>Simple-exchange protocols (i.e., low data-volume applications
              <xref format="default" target="RFC8085" /> that only send one or
              a few packets per transaction) might assume that the PMTU is
              symmetrical. That is, the PMTU is the same in both directions
              or at least not smaller for the return path. This optimization
              does not hold when the paths are not symmetric.</t>
            </li>

            <li>
              <t>The MinPMTU HBH Option can be used with ICMPv6
              <xref format="default" target="RFC4443" />. This requires a
              response from the remote node and therefore is restricted to use
              with ICMPv6 echo messages. The MinPMTU HBH Option
              could provide additional information about the PMTU that might
              be supported by a path. This could be used as a diagnostic tool
              to measure the PMTU of a path. As with other uses, the actual
              supported PMTU is only confirmed after receiving a response to a
              subsequent probe of the PMTU size.</t>
            </li>

            <li>
              <t>A datagram transport can utilize DPLPMTUD <xref format="default"
	      target="RFC8899" />. For
	      example, QUIC (see <xref format="default" target="RFC9000"
	      sectionFormat="of" section="14.3"/>) can
              use DPLPMTUD to determine whether the path to a destination will
              support a desired maximum datagram size. When using the IPv6
              MinPMTU HBH Option, the Option could be added to an
              additional QUIC PMTU probe that is of minimal size (or one no
              larger than the currently supported PMTU size). Once the return
              Path MTU value in the MinPMTU HBH Option has been
              learned, DPLPMTUD can be triggered to test for a larger PLPMTU
              using an appropriately sized PLPMTU probe packet (see <xref
	      format="default" target="RFC8899" sectionFormat="of" section="5.3.1"/>).</t>
            </li>

            <li>
              <t>The use of this Option with DNS and DNSSEC over UDP is
              expected to work for paths where the PMTU is symmetric. The DNS
              server will learn the PMTU from the DNS query messages. If the
              Rtn-PMTU value is smaller, then a large DNSSEC response might be
              dropped and the known problems with PMTUD will then occur. DNS
              and DNSSEC over transport protocols that can carry the PMTU
              ought to work.</t>
            </li>

            <li>
              <t>This method also can be used with anycast to discover the
              PMTU of the path, but the use needs to be aware that the anycast
              binding might change.</t>

          requires a method to assure that the information in the Option Data
          is provided by a node on the path. This validates that the packet
          forms a part of an existing flow, using context available at the
          upper layer. For example, a TCP connection or UDP application that
          maintains the related state and uses a randomized ephemeral port
          would provide this basic validation to protect from off-path data

          connection context at the transport layer. A connectionless upper

          exercised in using the Rtn-PMTU value. Specifically:</t>

          <ul spacing="normal">

          <t>To avoid unintentional dropping of packets that exceed the actual
          PMTU (e.g., Scenario 3 in <xref target="Intro1" />), the source host
          can delay increasing the PMTU until a probe packet with the size of
          the Rtn-PMTU value has been successfully acknowledged by the upper
          layer, confirming that the path supports the larger PMTU. This
          probing increases robustness but adds one additional path round-trip 
          time before the PMTU is updated. This use resembles that of PTB

        <t>For comparison, the ICMPv6 PTB message used in Path MTU Discovery <xref
        format="default" target="RFC8201"/> and the source
        host have an inherent trust relationship with the destination host
        including this Option. This trust relationship can be used to help
        verify the Option. ICMPv6 PTB messages are sent from any
        router on the path to the destination host. The source host has no
        prior knowledge of these routers (except for the first hop
        router).</t>

        <t>Reception of this packet will require processing as the network
        stack parses the packet before the packet is delivered to the 
        upper-layer protocol. This network-layer Option processing is normally
        completed before any upper-layer protocol delivery checks are
        performed.</t>

        <t>The network layer does not normally have sufficient information to
        validate that the packet carrying an Option originated from the
        destination (or an on-path node). It also does not typically have
        sufficient context to demultiplex the packet to identify the related
        transport flow. This can mean that any changes resulting from
        reception of the Option applies to all flows between a pair of
        endpoints.</t>

        <t>These considerations are no different than other uses of Hop-by-Hop
        Options, and this is the use case for PMTUD. The following section
        describes a mitigation for this attack.</t>

      <section anchor="Security-upp" numbered="true"
               title="Validating Use of the Option Data" toc="default">
        <t>Transport protocols should be designed to provide protection from
        data injection attacks by off-path devices, and mechanisms should be
        described in the Security Considerations section for each transport
        specification (see <xref target="RFC8085" sectionFormat="of"
	section="5.1">"UDP Usage Guidelines"</xref>). For example, a TCP or UDP
        application that maintains the related state and uses a randomized
        ephemeral port would provide basic protection. TLS <xref
        format="default" target="RFC8446" /> or IPsec <xref format="default"
        target="RFC4301" /> provide cryptographic authentication. An upper-layer 
        protocol that validates each received packet discards any packet
        when this validation fails. In this case, the host <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also discard
        the associated Option Data from the MinPMTU HBH Option without
        further processing (<xref target="Transport" />).</t>

        <t>A network node on the path has visibility of all packets it
        forwards. By observing the network packet payload, the node might be
        able to construct a packet that might be validated by the destination
        host. Such a node would also be able to drop or limit the flow in
        other ways that could be potentially more disruptive. Authenticating
        the packet, for example, using IPsec <xref format="default"
        target="RFC4301" /> or TLS <xref format="default" target="RFC8446" />
        mitigates this attack. Note that the authentication style of the Authentication
	Header (AH)
	<xref format="default" target="RFC4302" />, while authenticating the payload
        and outer IPv6 header, does not check Hop-by-Hop Options that change
        on route.</t>

      <section anchor="Security-pmtud" numbered="true"
               title="Direct Use of the Rtn-PMTU Value" toc="default">
        <t>The simplest way to utilize the Rtn-PMTU value is to directly use
        this to update the PMTU. This approach results in a set of security
        issues when the Option carries malicious data:</t>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <t>A direct update of the PMTU using the Rtn-PMTU value could
            result in an attacker inflating or reducing the size of the host
            PMTU for the destination. Forcing a reduction in the PMTU can
            decrease the efficiency of network use, might increase the number
            of packets/fragments required to send the same volume of payload
            data, and can prevent sending an unfragmented datagram larger than
            the PMTU. Increasing the PMTU can result in a path silently dropping packets
            (described as a black hole in <xref format="default" target="RFC8899"/>) when
            the source host sends packets larger than the actual PMTU. This
            persists until the PMTU is next updated.</t>
          </li>

          <li>
            <t>The method can be used to solicit a response from the
            destination host. A malicious attacker could forge a packet that
            causes the destination to add the Option to a packet sent to the
            source host. A forged value of Rtn-PMTU in the Option Data might
            also impact the remote endpoint, as described in the previous
            bullet. This persists until a valid MinPMTU HBH Option is
            received. This attack could be mitigated by limiting the sending
            of the MinPMTU HBH Option in reply to incoming packets that
            carry the Option.</t>

      <section anchor="Security-dplpmtud" numbered="true"
               title="Using the Rtn-PMTU Value as a Hint for Probing"
               toc="default">
        <t>Another way to utilize the Rtn-PMTU value is to indirectly trigger
        a probe to determine if the path supports a PMTU of size Rtn-PMTU.
        This approach needs context for the flow and hence assumes an upper-layer 
        protocol that validates the packet that carries the Option (see
        <xref target="Security-upp" />). This is the case when used in
        combination with DPLPMTUD <xref format="default" target="RFC8899" />.
        A set of security considerations result when an Option carries
        malicious data:</t>

        <ul>
          <li>If the forged packet carries a validated Option with a non-zero
          Rtn-PMTU field, the upper-layer protocol could utilize the
          information in the Rtn-PMTU field. A Rtn-PMTU larger than the
          current PMTU can trigger a probe for a new size.</li>

          <li>If the forged packet carries a non-zero Min-PMTU field, the
          upper-layer protocol would change the cached information about the
          path from the source. The cached information at the destination host
          will be overwritten when the host receives another packet that
          includes a MinPMTU HBH Option corresponding to the flow.</li>

          <li>Processing of the Option could cause a destination host to add
          the MinPMTU HBH Option to a packet sent to the source host.
          This Option will carry a Rtn-PMTU value that could have been updated
          by the forged packet. The impact of the source host receiving this
          resembles that discussed previously.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Security-mbox" numbered="true"
               title="Impact of Middleboxes" toc="default">
        <t>There is evidence that some middleboxes drop packets that include
        Hop-by-Hop Options. For example, a firewall might drop a packet that
        carries an unknown extension header or Option. This practice is
        expected to decrease as the Option becomes more widely used. Methods
        to address this are discussed in <xref target="HBHblackhole" />.</t>

        <t>When a forged packet causes a packet that includes the MinPMTU HBH 
        Option to be sent and the return path does not forward packets with 
        this Option, the packet will be dropped (see <xref
        target="HBHblackhole"/>). This attack is mitigated by validating the
        Option Data before use and by limiting the rate of responses
        generated. An upper layer could further mitigate the impact by
        responding to an R-Flag by including the Option in a packet that does
        not carry application data.</t>

     <name>Examples of Usage</name>

      <t>This section provides examples that illustrate a use of the MinPMTU
      HBH Option by a source using DPLPMTUD to discover the PLPMTU supported
      by a path. They consider a path where the on-path router has been
      configured with an outgoing MTU of d'. The source starts by transmission
      of packets of size a and then uses DPLPMTUD to seek to increase the
      size in steps resulting in sizes of b, c, d, e, etc. (chosen by the search
      algorithm used by DPLPMTUD). The search algorithm terminates with a
      PLPMTU that is at least d and is less than or equal to d'.</t>

      <t>The first example considers DPLPMTUD without using the MinPMTU HBH
      Option. In this case, DPLPMTUD searches using a probe packet that increases in
      size. Probe packets of size e are sent, which are larger than
      the actual PMTU. In this example, PTB messages are not received from the
      routers, and repeated unsuccessful probes result in the search phase
      completing. Packets of data are never sent with a size larger than the
      size of the last confirmed probe packet. Acknowledgments (ACKs) of data packets
      are not shown.</t>

      <t>The second example considers DPLPMTUD with the MinPMTU HBH Option set
      on a connectivity probe packet.</t>

      <t>The IPv6 Option is sent end to end, and the Min-PMTU is updated by a
      router on the path to d', which is returned in a response that also sets
      the MinPMTU HBH Option. Upon receiving the Rtn-PMTU value,
      DPLPMTUD immediately sends a probe packet of the target size d'. If
      the probe packet is confirmed for the path, the PLPMTU is updated,
      allowing the source to use data packets up to size d'. (The search
      algorithm is allowed to continue to probe to see if the path supports a
      larger size.) 
      Packets of data are never sent with a size larger than the last
      confirmed probe size d'.       
      </t>

      </figure>

      <t>The final example considers DPLPMTUD with the MinPMTU HBH Option set
      on a connectivity probe packet but shows the effect when this
      connectivity probe packet is dropped.</t>

      <t>In this case, the packet with the MinPMTU HBH Option is not received.
      DPLPMTUD searches using probe packets of increasing size, increasing the
      PLPMTU when the probes are confirmed. An ICMPv6 PTB message is received
      when the probed size exceeds the actual PMTU, indicating a PTB_SIZE of
      d'. DPLPMTUD immediately sends a probe packet of the target size d'.
      If the probe packet is confirmed for the path, the PLPMTU is updated,
      allowing the source to use data packets up to size d'. If the ICMPv6 PTB
      message is not received, the DPLPMTU will be the last confirmed probe
      size, which is d.</t>

      <t>The number of probe rounds depends on the number of steps needed by
      the search algorithm and is typically larger for a larger PMTU.</t>
