    This document updates the 6LoWPAN extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    (specified in RFCs 4861 and 8505) to enable a listener to subscribe to an IPv6 anycast
    or multicast address. This document also updates the Routing Protocol for
    Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) (specified in RFCs 6550 and 6553) to add a new Non-Storing
    multicast mode and new support for anycast addresses in Storing and
    Non-Storing modes.  This document extends RFC 9010 to enable a 6LoWPAN
    Router (6LR) to inject the anycast and multicast addresses in RPL.

<section anchor="introduction">
  <name>Introduction</name>

  <t>The design of Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused on
  saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. Other design
  constraints, such as a limited memory capacity, duty cycling of the LLN
  devices, and low-power lossy transmissions, derive from that primary concern.
  The radio (when both transmitting or simply listening) is a major energy drain,
  and the LLN protocols must be adapted to allow the nodes to remain sleeping
  with the radio turned off at most times.</t>

  <t>"RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks" <xref target="RFC6550"/> provides IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200"/> routing
  services within such constraints. To save signaling and routing state in
  constrained networks, the RPL routing is only performed along a
  Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) that is optimized to
  reach a Root node, as opposed to along the shortest path between two peers,
  which may be a fuzzy concept anyway in a radio LLN.</t>

  <t>This stretches the routes between RPL nodes inside the DODAG for a vastly reduced
  amount of control traffic and routing state that would be required to
  operate an any-to-any shortest path protocol. Additionally, broken routes
  may be fixed lazily and on-demand based on data plane inconsistency
  discovery, which avoids wasting energy in the proactive repair of unused
  paths.</t>

  <t>RPL uses Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages to
  establish Downward routes.  DAO messages are an optional feature for
  applications that require point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or point-to- point
  (P2P) traffic.  RPL supports two modes of Downward traffic: Storing (fully
  stateful) or Non-Storing (fully source routed); see <xref target="RFC6550"
  sectionFormat="of" section="9"/>. The mode is signaled in the Mode of
  Operation (MOP) field in the DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages and
  applies to the whole RPL Instance.</t>

<t>Any given RPL Instance is either Storing or Non-Storing.  In both cases,
  P2P packets travel Up toward a DODAG root then Down to the final destination
  (unless the destination is on the Upward route).  In the Non-Storing case,
  the packet will travel all the way to a DODAG root before traveling Down.
  In the Storing case, the packet may be directed Down towards the destination
  by a common ancestor of the source and the destination prior to reaching a
  DODAG root. <xref target="RFC6550" sectionFormat="of" section="12"/> details
  the Storing Mode of Operation with multicast support with
  source-independent multicast routing in RPL.</t>
 
  <t>The classical Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol <xref
  target="RFC4861"/> <xref target="RFC4862"/> was defined for serial links and
  shared transit media such as Ethernet at a time when broadcast on
  those media types was cheap, while memory for neighbor cache was expensive.  It was thus
  designed as a reactive protocol that relies on caching and multicast
  operations for the Address Discovery (aka lookup) and Duplicate Address
  Detection (DAD) of IPv6 unicast addresses.  Those multicast operations
  typically impact every node on-link when at most one is really
  targeted. This is a waste of energy and implies that all nodes are awake to
  hear the request, which is inconsistent with power-saving (sleeping)
  modes.</t>

  <t>The original specification for 6LoWPAN ND, "Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over
  Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)" <xref
  target="RFC6775"/>, was introduced to avoid the excessive use of multicast
  messages and enable IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained nodes.
  <xref target="RFC6775"/> changes the classical IPv6 ND model to proactively
  establish the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) associated to the unicast address
  of a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) in one or more 6LoWPAN Routers (6LRs) that serve it.  To
  that effect, <xref target="RFC6775"/> defines a new Address Registration
  Option (ARO) that is placed in unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and
  Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between the 6LN and the 6LR.</t>

  <t>"Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
  Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery" <xref target="RFC8505"/> updates <xref
  target="RFC6775"/> so that a generic Address Registration mechanism can be
  used to access services such as routing and ND proxy and introduces the
  Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) for that purpose. This provides
  a routing-agnostic interface for a host to request that the router injects a
  unicast IPv6 address in the local routing protocol and provides return
  reachability for that address.</t>

  <t>"Routing for RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) Leaves" <xref target="RFC9010"/> provides the
  router counterpart of the mechanism for a host that implements <xref
  target="RFC8505"/> to inject its unicast Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) and
  Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs) in RPL.  Although RPL also provides
  multicast routing, 6LoWPAN ND supports only the registration of unicast
  addresses, and there is no equivalent of <xref target="RFC9010"/> to specify
  the 6LR behavior upon the subscription of one or more multicast addresses.</t>

  <t>"Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6" <xref
  target="RFC3810"/> enables the router to learn which node listens to which
  multicast address, but as the classical IPv6 ND protocol, MLD relies on
  multicasting queries to all nodes, which is unfit for low-power operations.
  As for IPv6 ND, it makes sense to let the 6LNs control when and how they
  maintain the state associated to their multicast addresses in the 6LR, e.g.,
  during their own wake time. In the case of a constrained node that already
  implements <xref target="RFC8505"/> for unicast reachability, it makes sense
  to extend that support to subscribe the multicast addresses they listen
  to.</t>

  <t>This specification Extends <xref target="RFC8505"/> and <xref
  target="RFC9010"/> by adding the capability for the 6LN to subscribe anycast
  and multicast addresses and for the 6LR to inject them in RPL when
  appropriate. Note that due to the unreliable propagation of packets in the
  LLN, it cannot be guaranteed that any given packet is delivered once and
  only once. If a breakage happens along the preferred parent tree that is
  normally used for multicast forwarding, the packet going Up may be rerouted
  to an alternate parent, leading to potential failures and duplications,
  whereas a packet going Down will not be delivered in the subtree. It is up
  to the Upper Layer Protocols (ULPs) to cope with both situations.</t>

  <name>Overview</name>

   <t>This specification Extends <xref target="RFC8505"/> to provide a registration method (called "subscription" in this case) for anycast and multicast addresses. The specification inherits the proof of ownership defined in <xref target="RFC8928"/> that already protects the address registration in <xref target="RFC8505"/> to also protect the new subscription mechanism. <xref target="RFC8505"/> is agnostic to the routing protocol in which the address may be redistributed.</t>

<t>As opposed to unicast addresses, there might be multiple registrations
   from multiple parties for the same address. The router retains one
   registration per party for each multicast or anycast address but injects the
   route into the routing protocol only once for each address. The injection
   happens asynchronously to the registration. On the other hand, the validation
   exchange with the
   registrar (6LBR) is still needed if the router checks the right for the
   host to listen to the anycast or multicast address.</t>

   <t><xref target="figSub"/> depicts the registration of an anycast or a
   multicast address.  As shown, the 6LBR receives and accepts multiple
   EDAR messages for the same address, and the address being
   registered by multiple nodes is not treated as a duplication.</t>

   <t>In classical networks, <xref target="RFC8505"/> may be used for an ND
   proxy operation as specified in <xref target="RFC8929"/> or redistributed
   in a full-fledged routing protocol such as what might be done in BGP for
   Ethernet VPN <xref target="I-D.thubert-bess-secure-evpn-mac-signaling"/> or
   in the Routing in Fat Trees (RIFT) protocol <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-rift-rift"/>. The device mobility can be gracefully
   supported as long as the routers can exchange and make sense of the
   sequence counter in the TID field of the EARO.</t>

<t>In the case of LLNs, RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> is the routing
   protocol of choice and <xref target="RFC9010"/> specifies how the unicast
   address advertised with <xref target="RFC8505"/> is redistributed in
   RPL. This specification also provides RPL extensions for anycast and
   multicast address operation and redistribution. In the RPL case, and unless
   specified otherwise, the behavior is the same as it is for unicast for the 6LBR that acts as RPL Root, the intermediate routers Down the RPL graph, the 6LRs that act as access
   routers, and the 6LNs that are the RPL-unaware destinations. In particular, forwarding a packet happens as specified in
   <xref target="RFC6550" sectionFormat="of" section="11"/>, including loop
   avoidance and detection, though in the multicast case, multiple copies
   might be generated.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC8505"/> is a prerequisite to this specification.  A
   node that implements this <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also implement <xref
   target="RFC8505"/>.  This specification modifies existing options and
   updates the associated behaviors to enable the registration for multicast
   addresses as an extension to <xref target="RFC8505"/>.  As with the registration
   of a unicast
   address, the subscription to anycast and multicast addresses
   between a node and its router(s) is agnostic (meaning it is independent) from the routing protocol in which this information may be
   redistributed or aggregated by the router to other routers. However, protocol
   extensions would be needed in the protocol when multicast services are not
   available.</t>

   <t>This specification also Extends <xref target="RFC6550"/> and
   <xref target="RFC9010"/> to add multicast ingress replication (IR) in
   Non-Storing mode and anycast support in both Storing and Non-Storing modes in the case of a route-over multilink subnet based
   on the RPL routing protocol.
   A 6LR that implements the RPL extensions specified herein <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also
   implement <xref target="RFC9010"/>.</t>

   <t><xref target="figref"/> illustrates the typical scenario of an LLN as
   a single IPv6 subnet, with a 6LBR that acts as Root
   for RPL operations and maintains a registry of the active registrations as
   an abstract data structure called an "Address Registrar" for 6LoWPAN ND.</t>

    <t>The LLN may be a hub-and-spoke access link such as (Low-Power) Wi-Fi
    <xref target="IEEE80211"/> and (Low-Energy) Bluetooth <xref
    target="IEEE802151"/> or a Route-Over LLN such as the Wi-SUN <xref
    target="I-D.heile-lpwan-wisun-overview"/> and IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4 (6TiSCH) <xref
    target="RFC9030"/> meshes that leverage 6LoWPAN <xref target="RFC4919"/>
    <xref target="RFC6282"/> and RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> over IEEE 802.15.4 <xref
    target="IEEE802154"/>.</t>

   <t>A leaf acting as a 6LN registers its unicast addresses to a RPL
   router acting as a 6LR using a Layer 2 unicast NS message with an EARO as
   specified in <xref target="RFC8505"/>.
   The registration state is periodically renewed by the Registering Node
   before the lifetime indicated in the EARO expires. As for unicast IPv6
   addresses, the 6LR uses an EDAR and then an EDAC exchange with the 6LBR to notify the
   6LBR of the presence of the listeners.</t>
   
   <t>This specification updates the EARO with a new 2-bit field, the P-Field,
   as detailed in <xref target="R8505E"/>.  The existing R flag that requests
   reachability for the Registered Address gets new behavior.  With this
   extension, the 6LNs can now subscribe to the anycast and multicast addresses
   they listen to, using a new P-Field in the EARO to signal that the
   registration is for a multicast address. Multiple 6LNs may subscribe the
   same multicast address to the same 6LR. Note the use of the term
   "subscribe": this means that when using the EARO registration mechanism, a node registers the
   unicast addresses that it owns but subscribes to the multicast addresses
   that it listens to.</t>
   
   <t>With this specification, the 6LNs can also subscribe the anycast
   addresses they accept using a new P-Field in the EARO to signal that the
   registration is for an anycast address. For multicast addresses, multiple 6LNs may
   subscribe the same anycast address to the same 6LR.</t>

   <t>If the R flag is set in the subscription of one or more 6LNs for the
   same address, the 6LR injects the anycast addresses and multicast addresses
   of a scope larger than the link-scope in RPL, based on the longest subscription
   lifetime across the active subscriptions for the address.</t>
   
   <t>In the RPL Storing Mode of Operation with multicast support (<xref target="RFC6550" sectionFormat="of" section="12"/>), the DAO
   messages for the multicast address percolate along the RPL-preferred parent
   tree and mark a subtree that becomes the multicast tree for that multicast
   address, with 6LNs that subscribed to the address as the leaves.  As
   prescribed in <xref target="RFC6550" sectionFormat="of" section="12"/>, the 6LR forwards a
   multicast packet as an individual unicast Medium Access Control (MAC) frame to each peer along the
   multicast tree, except to the node it received the packet from.</t>

   <t>In the new RPL Non-Storing Mode of Operation with ingress replication multicast support
   that is introduced here, the DAO messages announce the multicast addresses
   as Targets, and never as Transits. The multicast distribution is an
   IR whereby the Root encapsulates the multicast packets to
   all the 6LRs that are transit for the multicast address, using the same
   source-routing header as for unicast targets attached to the respective
   6LRs.</t>

   <t>LLN links are typically Direct MAC Broadcast (DMB) (see more in <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-over-wireless" />) with no emulation to increase
   range (over multiple radio hops) or reliability.  In such links,
   broadcasting is unreliable and asynchronous transmissions force a listener
   to remain awake, so asynchronous broadcasting is generally inefficient.
   Thus, the expectation is that whenever possible, the 6LRs deliver the
   multicast packets as individual unicast MAC frames to each of the 6LNs that
   subscribed to the multicast address.  On the other hand, in a network where
   nodes do not sleep, asynchronous broadcasting may still help recovering
   faster when state is lost.</t>

   <t>With this specification, anycast addresses can be injected in RPL in
   both Storing and Non-Storing modes. In Storing mode, the RPL router accepts
   DAO messages from multiple children for the same anycast address, but it only forwards
   a packet to one of the children.  In Non-Storing mode, the Root maintains
   the list of all the RPL nodes that announced the anycast address as Target,
   but it forwards a given packet to only one of them.</t>
   
   <t>Operationally speaking, deploying a new MOP means that one cannot update
   a live network. The network administrator must create a new instance with
   MOP 5 and migrate nodes to that instance by allowing them to join it.</t>
   
   <t>For backward compatibility, this specification allows building a single
   DODAG signaled as MOP 1 that conveys anycast, unicast, and multicast
   packets using the same source-routing mechanism; see more in <xref
   target="deploy"/>.</t>

<t>It is also possible to leverage this specification between the 6LN and
   the 6LR for the registration of unicast, anycast, and multicast IPv6
   addresses in networks that are not necessarily LLNs and/or where the
   routing protocol between the 6LR and its peer routers is not necessarily RPL. In that
   case, the distribution of packets between the 6LR and the 6LNs may
   effectively rely on a broadcast or multicast support at the lower layer
   (e.g., using this specification as a replacement to MLD in an Ethernet-bridged domain and still using either a plain MAC-layer broadcast or snooping of
   this protocol to control the flooding). It may also rely on overlay services
   to optimize the impact of Broadcast, Unknown, and Multicast (BUM) traffic over a
   fabric, e.g., registering with <xref
   target="I-D.thubert-bess-secure-evpn-mac-signaling"/> and forwarding with
   <xref target="RFC9574"/>.</t>

   <t>For instance, it is possible to operate a RPL Instance in the new
   Non-Storing Mode of Operation with ingress replication multicast support (while possibly
   signaling a MOP of 1) and use "Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
   Networks (MPL)" <xref target="RFC7731"/> for the multicast operation.  MPL
   floods the DODAG with the multicast messages independently of the RPL DODAG
   topologies. Two variations are possible:</t>

   <ul>
     <li>In one possible variation, all the 6LNs set the R flag in the EARO
     for a multicast target, upon which the 6LRs send a unicast DAO message to
     the Root; the Root filters out the multicast messages for which there is
     no listener and only floods when a listener exists.</li>

<li>In a simpler variation, the 6LNs do not set the R flag and the Root
     floods all the multicast packets over the whole DODAG. Using a
     configuration mechanism, it is also possible to control the behavior of the 6LR to
     ignore the R flag. It can be configured to either always or never send the DAO message and/or to control the Root and specify which groups it should flood or not
     flood.</li>
   </ul>

   <t>Note that if the configuration instructs the 6LR not to send the DAO message,
   then MPL can be used in conjunction with the RPL Storing mode as
   well.</t>

   the ROVR field as the indication of the origin of a Target advertisement in
   RPL DAO messages, as specified as an option in <xref
   target="RFC9010" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1"/>.</t>

   <t>This specification Extends <xref target="RFC6550"/> with a new P-Field in the RPL Target Option (RTO).</t>

   <t>The specification also Amends the behaviors of the Modes of Operation
   MOP 1 and MOP 3 and Extends <xref target="RFC6550"/> with a new MOP 5.</t>

   <section anchor="mrovr">
     <name>Mandating the ROVR Field</name>

   <t>For anycast and multicast advertisements (in NS or DAO messages),
   multiple origins may subscribe to the same address, in which case the
   multiple advertisements from the different or unknown origins are merged by
   the common parent; in that case, the common parent becomes the origin of
   the merged advertisements and uses its own ROVR value. On the other hand, a
   parent that propagates an advertisement from a single origin uses the
   original ROVR in the propagated RTO, as it does for unicast address
   advertisements, so the origin is recognized across multiple hops.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC6550"/> uses the Path Sequence in the Transit
   Information Option (TIO) to retain only the freshest unicast route and
   remove the stale ones, e.g., in the case of mobility. <xref target="RFC9010"/>
   copies the Transaction ID (TID) from the EARO into the Path Sequence and the ROVR field
   into the associated RTO.  This way, it is possible to
   identify both the Registering Node and the order of registration in RPL for
   each individual advertisement, so the most recent path and lifetime values
   are used.</t>

<t>This specification Extends <xref target="RFC6550"/> for anycast and
   multicast advertisements to require that the Path Sequence be used
   between, and only between, advertisements for the same Target and from the
   same origin (i.e., with the same ROVR value). In that case, only the
   freshest advertisement is retained, but the freshness comparison cannot
   apply if the origin is not determined (i.e., the origin did not support
   this specification).</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC6550"/> uses the Path Lifetime in the TIO to indicate
   the remaining time for which the advertisement is valid for unicast route
   determination, and a Path Lifetime value of 0 invalidates that route.
   <xref target="RFC9010"/> maps the Address Registration lifetime in the EARO
   and the Path Lifetime in the TIO so they are comparable when both forms of
   advertisements are received.</t>

<t>The RPL router that merges multiple advertisements for the same anycast
   or multicast addresses <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use and advertise the longest
   remaining lifetime across all the origins of the advertisements for that
   address.  When the lifetime expires, the router sends a no-path DAO message (i.e.,
   the lifetime is 0) using the same value for the ROVR value as for the previous
   advertisements. This value refers to either the single descendant that
   advertised the Target if there is only one or the router itself if there is more than one.</t>

   <t>Note that the Registration Lifetime, TID, and ROVR fields are also placed
   in the EDAR message so the state created by the EDAR is also comparable with
   that created upon an NS(EARO) or a DAO message. For simplicity, the text
   below mentions only NS(EARO) but it also applies to EDAR.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="mop3"><name>Updating MOP 3</name>

   <t>RPL supports multicast operations in the Storing Mode of Operation with
   multicast support (MOP 3), which provides source-independent multicast
   routing in RPL, as prescribed in <xref target="RFC6550" sectionFormat="of" section="12"/>.
   MOP 3 is a Storing Mode of Operation. This operation builds a multicast
   tree within the RPL DODAG for each multicast address. This specification
   provides additional details for the MOP 3.</t>

   <t>The expectation in MOP 3 is that the unicast traffic also follows the
   Storing Mode of Operation. However, this is rarely the case in LLN deployments
   of RPL where the Non-Storing Mode of Operation (MOP 1) is the norm.
   Though it is preferred to build separate RPL Instances, one in MOP 1 and
   one in MOP 3, this specification allows hybrid use of the Storing mode for
   multicast and the Non-Storing mode for unicast in the same RPL Instance, as is
   elaborated in more detail in <xref target="deploy"/>.</t>

   <t>For anycast and multicast advertisements, including MOP 3, the ROVR
   field is placed in the RTO as specified in <xref
   target="RFC9010"/> for both MOP 3 and MOP 5 as it is for unicast
   advertisements.</t>

   <t>Though it was implicit with <xref target="RFC6550"/>, this specification
   clarifies that the freshness comparison based on the Path Sequence is not
   used when the origin cannot be determined, which occurs in the case of multiple subscriptions of a multicast or unicast address.  The
   comparison is to be used only between advertisements from the same origin,
   which is either an individual subscriber or a descendant that merged
   multiple advertisements.</t>
   
   <t>A RPL router maintains a remaining Path Lifetime for each DAO message that it
   receives for a multicast target and sends its own DAO message for that target with
   the longest remaining lifetime across its listening children. If the router
   has only one descendant listening, it propagates the TID and ROVR as
   received. Conversely, if the router merges multiple advertisements
   (possibly including one for itself as a listener), the router uses its own
   ROVR and TID values. This implies a possible transition of ROVR and TID
   values when the number of listening children changes from one to more or
   back to one, which should not be considered as an error or a change of
   ownership by the parents above.</t>
  </section>

<section anchor="mop5"><name>New Non-Storing Multicast MOP</name>
<t>This specification adds a Non-Storing Mode of Operation with ingress
replication multicast support RPL (as assigned by IANA; see <xref target="RPL_Mode_Op"/>) whereby the
Non-Storing Mode DAO to the Root may advertise a multicast address in the RTO, whereas the TIO cannot.</t>

<t>In that mode, the RPL Root performs an IR operation
on the multicast packets. This means that it transmits one copy of each multicast
packet to each 6LR that is a transit for the multicast target, using the same
source-routing header and encapsulation as it would for a unicast packet for a
RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) attached to that 6LR.</t> 

<t>For the intermediate routers, the packet appears as any source-routed
unicast packet. The difference shows only at the 6LR, which terminates the
source-routed path and forwards the multicast packet to all 6LNs that
registered for the multicast address.</t>

<t>For a packet that is generated by the Root, the Root builds
a source-routing header as shown in <xref target="RFC9008" sectionFormat="of"
section="8.1.3"/>, but for which the last and only the last address is
multicast.  For a packet that is not generated by the Root, the Root
encapsulates the multicast packet as per <xref target="RFC9008"
sectionFormat="of" section="8.2.4"/>. In that case, the outer header is purely
unicast, and the encapsulated packet is purely multicast.</t>

<t>For anycast and multicast advertisements in NA messages (at the 6LR) and DAO messages (at the
Root), as discussed in <xref target="mop3"/>, the freshness
comparison based on the TID field is applied only between messages from the
same origin, as determined by the same value in the ROVR field.</t>

<t>The Root maintains a remaining Path Lifetime for each advertisement it
receives, and a 6LR generates the DAO message for multicast addresses with the
longest remaining lifetime across its registered 6LNs, using its own ROVR and
TID when multiple 6LNs have subscribed or when the 6LR is a subscriber.</t> 

<t>This specification allows enabling the
operation in a MOP 1 brown field for this new mode as well; see more in <xref target="deploy"/>.</t>
</section>


<section anchor="anic"><name>RPL Anycast Operation</name>
<t>With multicast, the address has a recognizable format, and a multicast
   packet is to be delivered to all the active subscribers.  In contrast, the
   format of an anycast address is not distinguishable from that of a unicast address. A
   legacy node may issue a DAO message without setting the P-Field to 2; the
   unicast behavior may apply to anycast traffic within a portion of the
   network, but the packets will still be delivered.  That message will be
   undistinguishable from a unicast advertisement, and the anycast behavior in
   the data plane can only happen if all the nodes that advertise the same
   anycast address are synchronized with the same TID. That way, the multiple
   paths can remain in the RPL DODAG.</t>

   <t>With the P-Field set to 2, this specification alleviates the issue of
   synchronizing the TIDs and ROVR fields. As for multicast, the freshness
   comparison based on the TID (in the EARO) and the Path Sequence (in the TIO) is
   ignored unless the messages have the same origin; this is inferred by the same
   ROVR in the RTO and/or the EARO, and the latest value of the lifetime is retained
   for each origin.</t>

   <t>A RPL router that propagates an advertisement from a single origin uses the
   ROVR and Path Sequence from that origin, whereas a router that merges
   multiple subscriptions uses its own ROVR and Path Sequence and the longest
   lifetime over the different advertisements.  A target is routed as anycast
   by a parent (or the Root) that received at least one DAO message for that
   target with the P-Field set to 2.</t>

<t>As opposed to multicast, the anycast operation described herein applies
   to both addresses and prefixes, and the P-Field can be set to 2 for both.
   An external destination (such as an address or prefix) that may be injected as a RPL
   Target from multiple border routers should be injected as anycast in RPL to
   enable load balancing. In contrast, a mobile target that is multihomed should
   be advertised as unicast over the multiple interfaces to favor the
   TID comparison instead of multipath load balancing.</t>

   <t>For either multicast or anycast, there can be multiple subscriptions
   from multiple origins, each using a different value of the ROVR field that
   identifies the individual subscription.

   The 6LR maintains a subscription
   state per value of the ROVR for each multicast or anycast address, but it injects
   the route into RPL only once for each address. In the case of a
   multicast address, this occurs only if its scope is larger than the link-scope (three or more).
   Since the subscriptions are considered separate, the check on the TID that
   acts as the subscription sequence only applies to the subscription with the
   same ROVR.</t>

   <t>Like the 6LR, a RPL router in Storing mode propagates the merged
   advertisement to its parent(s) in DAO messages once and only once for each
   address, but it retains a routing table entry for each of the children that
   advertised the address.</t>

   <t>When forwarding multicast packets Down the DODAG, the RPL router copies
   all the children that advertised the address in their DAO messages. In
   contrast, when forwarding anycast packets Down the DODAG, the RPL router
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> copy one and only one of the children that advertised
   the address in their DAO messages and forward it to one parent if there is no
   such child.</t>

  <name>New Registered Address Type Indicator P-Field</name>

  <t>The new Registered Address Type Indicator (RATInd) is created for use in the
  RTO, the EARO, and the header of EDAR messages.  The RATInd
  indicates whether an address is unicast, multicast, or anycast.  The new

<t>The P-Field can take the values shown in <xref target="AM2"/>.</t>

	 value. On the other hand, 6LoWPAN ND does not, so the value of 3
	 (meaning prefix registration) will not be processed adequately. As a

	 <ul>

	   <li>In the case of an EARO (see <xref target="R8505E"/>) or an EDAR

specification adds a new P-Field that is placed in the EARO flags and is set as

<section anchor="multireg">
  <name>Registration Extensions</name>

<t><xref target="RFC8505"/> specifies the following behaviors:</t>

<ul>
   <li>A router that expects to reboot may send a final RA message, upon which
   nodes should subscribe elsewhere or redo the subscription to the same
   router upon reboot.  In all other cases, a node reboot is silent.  When the
   node comes back to life, existing registration state might be lost if it
   was not persisted, e.g., in persistent memory.</li>
   <li>The registration method is specified only for unicast addresses.</li>
   <li>The 6LN must register all its ULAs and GUAs with an NS(EARO) message.</li>
   <li>The 6LN may set the R flag in the EARO to obtain return reachability
   services by the 6LR, e.g., through ND proxy operations or by injecting the
   route in a route-over subnet.</li>
   <li>the 6LR maintains a registration state per Registered Address, including an
   NCE with the Link-Layer Address (LLA) of the Registered Node (the 6LN here).</li>
</ul>

<t>This specification Amends the above behaviors and Extends them with the
   following behaviors:</t>
   <ul>
     <li>The concept of subscription is introduced for anycast and multicast
     addresses as an extension to the registration of a unicast address.  The
     respective operations are similar from the perspective of the 6LN, but
     they show important differences on the router side, which maintains a separate
     state for each origin and merges them in its own advertisements.</li>

     <li>  
       <t>New ARO Statuses are introduced to indicate a "Registration Refresh
       Request" and an "Invalid Registration" (see <xref
       target="AROstat"/>).</t>

       <t>The former status is used in asynchronous NA(EARO) messages to
       indicate to peer 6LNs that they are requested to reregister all
       addresses that were previously registered to the originating node. The
       NA message may be sent to a unicast or a multicast link-scope address
       and should be contained within the L2 range where nodes may have
       effectively registered or, respectively, subscribed to this router (e.g., a radio
       broadcast domain). The latter is generic to any error in the EARO and
       is used, for example, to report that the P-Field is not consistent with the
       Registered Address in NS(EARO) and EDAR messages.</t>

       <t>A router that wishes to refresh its state (e.g., upon reboot or in
       any situation where it may have missed a registration or lost a
       registration state) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send an asynchronous NA(EARO)
       with this new status value. Failure to do so will delay the recovery of
       the network until the next periodic registration by the attached 6LNs
       and packets may be lost until then.  That asynchronous multicast
       NA(EARO) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent to the all-nodes link-scope
       multicast address (ff02::1), and the Target <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to
       the link-local address that was exposed previously by this node to
       accept registrations.</t>

       <t>The TID field in the multicast NA(EARO) message is the one associated to the
       Target and follows the same rules as the TID in the NS(EARO) message for the
       same Target; see <xref target="RFC8505" sectionFormat="of"
       section="5.2"/>, which points to <xref target="RFC6550"
       sectionFormat="of" section="7.2"/> for the lollipop mechanism used in
       the TID operation. It is incremented by the sender each time it sends a
       new series of NS and/or NA messages with the EARO about the Target.  The TID
       indicates a reboot when it is in the "straight" part of the lollipop,
       between the initial value and 255. After that, the TID remains below 128
       as long as the device is alive. An asynchronous multicast NA(EARO) with
       a TID below 128 <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be considered as indicating a
       reboot.</t>

     <t>The asynchronous multicast NA(EARO) indicating a "Registration Refresh
     Request" <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be reissued a few times within a short
     period, to increase the chances that the message is received by all
     registered nodes despite the unreliable transmissions within the LLN; the
     TID <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be incremented each time.  The receiver 6LN
     <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consider that multiple NA(EARO) messages indicating a
     "Registration Refresh Request" from the same 6LR received within that
     short period with comparable and increasing TID values (i.e., their absolute difference is less than the
     SEQUENCE_WINDOW; see <xref target="RFC6550" sectionFormat="of"
     section="7.2"/>)  are in fact indicative of the same request. The 6LN <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> process one and only one of the
     series of messages. If the TIDs are desynchronized (not comparable) or
     decreased, then the NA(EARO) is considered as a new request and it
     <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be processed.</t>

     <t>The multicast NA(EARO) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be resent enough times
     for the TID to be issued with the value of 255 so the next NA(EARO) after
     the initial series is outside the lollipop and is not confused with a
     reboot.  By default, the TID initial setting after boot is 252, the
     SEQUENCE_WINDOW is 4, the duration of the short period is 10 seconds, the
     interval between retries is 1 second, and the number of retries is 3. To
     reach 255 at boot time, the sender <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> either issue at
     least 4 NA messages, skip a TID value, or start with a value that is more
     than 252.  The best values for the short period, the number of retries,
     and the TID initial setting depend on the environment and
     <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be configurable.</t>
   </li>

   <li>
     <t>A new IPv6 ND Consistent Uptime Option (CUO) is introduced to be
     placed in IPv6 ND messages. The CUO allows figuring out the state
     consistency between the sender and the receiver. For instance, a node
     that rebooted needs to reset its uptime to 0.  A router that changed
     information like a prefix information option has to advertise an
     incremented state sequence. To that effect, the CUO carries a Node State
     Sequence Information (NSSI) and a Consistent Uptime.  See <xref
     target="CUO"/> for the option details.</t>

     <t>A node that receives the CUO checks whether it is indicative of a
     desynchronization between peers. A peer that discovers that a router has
     changed should reassess which addresses it formed based on the new PIOs
     from that router and resync the state that it installed in the router
     (e.g., the registration state for its addresses).  In the process, the peer
     may attempt to:</t>
     <ul>
       <li>form new addresses and register them,</li>
       <li>deprecate old addresses and deregister them using a Lifetime of 0, and</li>
       <li>reform any potentially lost state (e.g., by registering again an
       existing address that it will keep using).</li>
     </ul>

     <t>A loss of state is inferred if the Consistent Uptime of the peer is
     less than the time since the state was installed, or if the NSSI is
     incremented for a Consistent Uptime.</t>
   </li>
   <li>
     <t>Registration for multicast and anycast addresses is now supported. The
     P-Field is added to the EARO to signal when the Registered Address is
     anycast or multicast. The value of the P-Field is not consistent with
     the Registered Address if:</t>

   <ul>
     <li>the Registered Address is a multicast address (<xref target="RFC4291"
     sectionFormat="of" section="2.4"/>) and the P-Field indicates a value
     that is not 1, or</li>
     <li>the Registered Address is not a multicast address and the P-Field
     indicates a value that is 1.</li>
   </ul>

   <t>If this occurs, then the message, NS(EARO) or EDAR, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be dropped, and
   the receiving node <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> either reply with a status of 12
   "Invalid Registration" or remain silent.</t>
 </li>


   <li>The Status field in the EDAR message that was reserved and not used in
   <xref target="RFC8505"/> is repurposed to transport the flags to signal
   multicast and anycast.</li>

   <li>The 6LN <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also subscribe all the IPv6 multicast
   addresses that it listens to, and it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set the P-Field to
   1 in the EARO for those addresses.  The one exception is the all-nodes
   link-scope multicast address ff02::1 <xref target="RFC4291"/>, which is
   implicitly registered by all nodes, meaning that all nodes are expected to
   accept messages sent to ff02::1 but are not expected to register it.</li>

   <li>The 6LN <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> set the R flag in the EARO to obtain the
   delivery of the multicast packets by the 6LR (e.g., by MLD proxy
   operations, or by injecting the address in a route-over subnet or in the
   Protocol Independent Multicast <xref target="RFC7761"/> protocol).</li>

   <li>The 6LN <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also subscribe all the IPv6 anycast
   addresses that it supports, and it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set the P-Field in
   the EARO to 2 for those addresses.</li>
   
   <li>The 6LR and the 6LBR are extended to accept more than one subscription
   for the same address when it is anycast or multicast, since multiple 6LNs
   may subscribe to the same address of these types. In both cases, the ROVR
   in the EARO uniquely identifies a registration within the namespace of the
   Registered Address.</li>
   
   <li>The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also consider that all the nodes that
   registered an address to it (as known by the Source Link-Layer Address
   Option (SLLAO)) also registered ff02::1 <xref target="RFC4291"/> to the all-nodes link-scope multicast address.</li>

   <li>The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> maintain a subscription state per tuple
   (IPv6 address, ROVR) for both anycast and multicast types of addresses. It
   <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> notify the 6LBR with an EDAR message, unless it
   determined that the 6LBR is legacy and does not support this
   specification. In turn, the 6LBR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> maintain a
   subscription state per tuple (IPv6 address, ROVR) for both anycast and
   multicast types of address.</li>

   </ul>

<section anchor="updating2">
  <name>Extending RFC 9010</name>

  <t><xref target="RFC9010"/> specifies the following behaviors:</t>
   <ul>
     <li>The 6LR has no specified procedure to inject multicast and anycast routes in RPL even though RPL supports multicast.</li>
     <li>Upon a registration with the R flag set to 1 in the EARO, the 6LR injects the address in the RPL unicast support.</li>
     <li>Upon receiving a packet directed to a unicast address for which it has an
     active registration, the 6LR delivers the packet as a unicast Layer 2 frame
     to the LLA of the node that registered the unicast address.</li>
   </ul>

   <t>This specification Extends <xref target="RFC9010"/> by adding the following behavior:</t>

   <ul>
     <li>Upon a subscription with the R flag and the P-Field both set to 1 in the EARO,
     if the scope of the multicast address is above link-scope <xref target="RFC7346"/>,
     then the 6LR injects the address in the RPL multicast support and sets the P-Field in the RTO to 1 as well.</li>
     <li>Upon a subscription with the R flag set to 1 and the P-Field set to 2 in the EARO,
     the 6LR injects the address in the new RPL anycast support and sets the P-Field
     to 2 in the RTO.</li>
     <li>Upon receiving a packet directed to a multicast address for which it has at
     least one subscription, the 6LR delivers a copy of the packet as a unicast
     Layer 2 frame to the LLA of each of the nodes that registered to that
     multicast address.</li>
     <li>Upon receiving a packet directed to an anycast address for which it has at
     least one subscription, the 6LR delivers a copy of the packet as a unicast
     Layer 2 frame to the LLA of exactly one of the nodes that registered to that
     multicast address.</li>

<section anchor="sec8928">
  <name>Leveraging RFC 8928</name>

  <t>"Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-Power
  and Lossy Networks" <xref target="RFC8928"/> was defined to protect the ownership of unicast
  IPv6 addresses that are registered with <xref target="RFC8505"/>.</t>

  <t>With <xref target="RFC8928"/>, it is possible for a node to autoconfigure a
  pair of public and private keys and use them to sign the registration of
  addresses that are either autoconfigured or obtained through other
  methods.</t>

  <t>The first hop router (the 6LR) may then validate a registration and perform
  source address validation on packets coming from the sender node (the 6LN).</t>

  <t>Anycast and multicast addresses are not owned by one node. Multiple nodes
  may subscribe to the same address.  In that context, the method specified in
  <xref target="RFC8928"/> cannot be used with autoconfigured key pairs to
  protect a single ownership.</t>

  <t>For an anycast or a multicast address, it is still possible to leverage
  <xref target="RFC8928"/> to enforce the right to subscribe.  If <xref
  target="RFC8928"/> is used, a key pair <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be associated with
  the address before it is deployed, and a ROVR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be generated
  from that key pair as specified in <xref target="RFC8928"/>.  The address and
  the ROVR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> then be installed in the 6LBR so it can recognize
  the address and compare the ROVR on the first subscription.</t>

  <t>The key pair <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> then be provisioned in each node that needs
  to subscribe to the anycast or multicast address, so the node can follow the
  steps in <xref target="RFC8928"/> to subscribe to the address.</t>

<t>The Consistent Uptime indicates how long the sender has been continuously
up and running (though possibly sleeping) without loss of state.  It is
expressed by the Uptime Mantissa in units of 2 to the power of the Uptime
Exponent in milliseconds. The receiver derives the boot time of the sender as the
current time minus the sender's Consistent Uptime.</t>

<t>If the boot time of the sender is updated to a newer time, any state that
the receiver installed in the sender before the reboot is probably lost. The
receiver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reassess all the state it installed in the server
(e.g., any registration) and reinstall if it is still needed.</t>

<t>The U flag not set in a unicast message indicates that
the sender has lost all state from this node.  If the U flag is set, then the Peer NSSI
field can be used to assess which changes the sender missed. For the other way
around, any state that was installed in the receiver from information by the
sender before it rebooted <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be removed and may or may not be
reinstalled later.</t>

<t>The value of the uptime is reset to 0 at some point of the sender's reboot
sequence, but it may not still be 0 when the first message is sent, so the
receiver must not expect a value of 0 as the signal of a reboot.</t>

new address or a router advertises a new prefix).  When persisting is not
possible, then the NSSI is randomly generated.</t>

<t>As long as the NSSI remains constant, the cross-dependent state (such as
addresses in a host that depend on a prefix in a router) can remain stable,
meaning less checks in the receiver.  Any change in the value of the NSSI is
an indication that the sender updated some state and that the dependent state
in the receiver should be reassessed (e.g., addresses that were formed based
on an RA with a previous NSSI should be checked, or new addresses may be
formed and registered).</t>

  <name>Operational Considerations</name>

  <t>With this specification, a RPL DODAG forms a realm, and multiple RPL
  DODAGs may be federated in a single RPL Instance administratively. This
  means that a multicast address that needs to span a RPL DODAG
  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use a scope of Realm-Local whereas a multicast address
  that needs to span a RPL Instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use a scope of
  Admin-Local as discussed in <xref target="RFC7346" sectionFormat="of"
  section="3"/>, "IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes".</t>

  <t>"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators" <xref target="RFC6052"/>
  enables embedding IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses. The Root of a DODAG may
  leverage that technique to translate IPv4 traffic in IPv6 and route along
  the RPL domain. When encapsulating a packet with an IPv4 multicast
  Destination Address, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use a multicast address with the
  appropriate scope, Realm-Local or Admin-Local.</t>

  <t>"Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses" <xref target="RFC3306"/>
  enables forming 2<sup>32</sup> multicast addresses from a single /64 prefix.
  If an IPv6 prefix is associated to an Instance or a RPL DODAG, this provides
  a namespace that can be used in any desired fashion. For instance, it is
  possible for a standard defining organization to form its own registry and
  allocate 32-bit values from that namespace to network functions or device
  types. When used within a RPL deployment that is associated with a /64
  prefix, the IPv6 multicast addresses can be automatically derived from the
  prefix and the 32-bit value for either a Realm-Local or an Admin-Local
  multicast address as needed in the configuration.</t>

  <t>This specification introduces the new RPL MOP 5.  Operationally speaking,
  deploying a new RPL MOP means that one cannot update a live network. The
  network administrator must create a new instance with MOP 5 and migrate
  nodes to that instance by allowing them to join it.</t>

  <t>In a "green field" deployment where all nodes support this specification,
  it is possible to deploy a single RPL Instance using a multicast MOP for
  unicast, multicast, and anycast addresses.</t>

  <t>In a "brown field" where legacy devices that do not support this
  specification coexist with upgraded devices, it is
  <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to deploy one RPL Instance in any MOP
  (typically MOP 1) for unicast that legacy nodes can join and a
  separate RPL Instance dedicated to multicast and anycast operations using a
  multicast MOP.</t>
  
  <t>To deploy a Storing mode multicast operation using MOP 3 in a RPL domain,
  it is required that the RPL routers that support MOP 3 have enough density
  to build a DODAG that covers all the potential listeners and includes the
  spanning multicast trees that are needed to distribute the multicast flows.
  This might not be the case when extending the capabilities of an existing
  network.</t>

  <t>In the case of the new Non-Storing multicast MOP, arguably the new
  support is only needed at the 6LRs that will accept multicast listeners. It
  is still required that each listener be able to reach at least one such 6LR, so the
  upgraded 6LRs must be deployed to cover all the 6LNs that need multicast
  services.</t>

  <t>Using separate RPL Instances for unicast traffic on the one hand and for
  anycast and multicast traffic on the other hand allows for the use of different
  objective functions; one favors the link quality Up for unicast collection
  and the other favors Downwards link quality for multicast distribution.</t>

  <t>However, this might be impractical in some use cases where the signaling and
  the state to be installed in the devices are very constrained, the upgraded
  devices are too sparse, or the devices do not support more multiple
  instances.</t>

  <t>When using a single RPL Instance, MOP 3 expects the Storing Mode of
  Operation for both unicast and multicast, which is an issue in constrained
  networks that typically use MOP 1 for unicast. This specification allows a
  mixed mode that is signaled as MOP 1 in the DIO messages for backward
  compatibility, where limited multicast and/or anycast is available, under
  the following conditions:</t>

  <ul>
    <li>There <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be enough density of the 6LRs that support the
    mixed mode to cover all the 6LNs that require multicast or anycast
    services.  In Storing mode, there <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be enough density of
    the 6LRs that support the mixed mode to also form a DODAG to the Root.</li>
    <li>The RPL routers that support the mixed mode are configured to operate
    in accordance with the desired operation in the network.</li>
    <li>The MOP signaled in the RPL DIO messages is MOP 1 to enable the legacy
    nodes to operate as leaves.</li>
    <li>The support of multicast and/or anycast in the RPL Instance
    <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be signaled by the 6LRs to the 6LN using a 6CIO; see
    <xref target="CIO"/>.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, the support of multicast in the RPL domain can be
    globally known by other means including configuration or external information such as  
    support of a version of an industry standard that mandates it. In
    that case, all the routers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the mixed mode.</li>
  </ul>

  <name>Security Considerations</name>

  <t>This specification Extends <xref target="RFC8505"/> and <xref
  target="RFC9010"/> and leverages <xref target="RFC9008"/>.  The security
  sections in these documents also apply to this document.  In particular, the
  link layer <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sufficiently protected to prevent rogue
  access.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC6550"> RPL </xref> already supports routing on multicast
  addresses, whereby the endpoint that subscribes to the group by injecting 
  the multicast address participates as a RPL-Aware Node (RAN) in the RPL.
  Using an extension of <xref target="RFC8505"/> as opposed to RPL to
  subscribe the address allows a RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) to subscribe as well.
  As noted in <xref target="RFC9010"/>, this provides a better security
  posture for the RPL network, since the nodes that do not really need to
  speak RPL, or are not trusted enough to inject RPL messages, can be
  forbidden from doing so, which bars a number of attack vectors from within
  RPL. Acting as an RUL, those nodes may still leverage the RPL network through
  the capabilities that are opened via ND operations. With this specification, a node
  that needs multicast delivery can now obtain the service in a RPL domain
  while not being allowed to inject RPL messages.</t>

  <t>Compared to <xref target="RFC6550"/>, this specification enables tracking the
  origin of the multicast subscription inside the RPL network.  This is a
  first step to enable a form of Route Ownership Validation (ROV) (see <xref
  target="RFC6811"/>) in RPL using the ROVR field in the EARO as proof of
  ownership.</t>

  <t><xref target="sec8928"/> leverages <xref target="RFC8928"/> to prevent a
  rogue node from registering a unicast address that it does not own.  The
  mechanism could be extended to anycast and multicast addresses if the values
  of the ROVR they use are known in advance, but how this is done is not in
  scope for this specification.  One way would be to authorize the
  ROVR of the valid users in advance.  A less preferred way would be to synchronize the
  ROVR and TID values across the valid subscribers as preshared key
  material.</t>

  <t>In the latter case, it could be possible to update the keys associated to
  an address in all the 6LNs, but the flow is not clearly documented and may
  not complete in due time for all nodes in LLN use cases. It may be simpler
  to install an all-new address with new keys over a period of time, and
  switch the traffic to that address when the migration is complete.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="back">
  <name>Backward Compatibility</name>
  
  <t>A legacy 6LN will not subscribe multicast addresses, and the service will
  be the same when the network is upgraded. A legacy 6LR will not set the X
  flag in the 6CIO, and an upgraded 6LN will not subscribe multicast
  addresses.</t>

  <t>Upon receiving an EDAR message, a legacy 6LBR may not realize that the address
  being registered is anycast or multicast and will return that it is a duplicate in
  the EDAC status. The 6LR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore a duplicate status in
  the EDAC for anycast and multicast addresses.</t>

  <t>As detailed in <xref target="deploy"/>, it is possible to add multicast on
  an existing MOP 1 deployment.</t>

  <t>The combination of a multicast address and the P-Field set to 0 in an RTO
  in a MOP 3 RPL Instance is an indication to the receiver that supports this
  specification (the parent) that the sender (child) does not support this specification.
  However, the RTO is accepted and processed as if the P-Field was set to 1 for backward compatibility.
  </t>

  <t>When the DODAG is operated in MOP 3, a legacy node will not set the P-Field
  and still expect multicast service as specified in <xref target="RFC6550"
  sectionFormat="of" section="12"/>.  In MOP 3, an RTO that is received with a
  target that is multicast and the P-Field set to 0 <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
  considered as multicast and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be processed as if the P-Field
  is set to 1.</t>
