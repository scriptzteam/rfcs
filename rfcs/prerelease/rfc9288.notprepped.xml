      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) allow for the extension of the IPv6
   protocol and provide support for core functionality, such as IPv6
   fragmentation.  However, common implementation limitations suggest that EHs present a challenge for IPv6 packet routing equipment, particularly when the IPv6 header chain needs to be processed for, as an example, enforcing Access Control Lists (ACLs) or implementing other functions <xref target="RFC9098" format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t>Several studies (e.g., <xref target="Huston-2022" format="default"/>, <xref target="I-D.vyncke-v6ops-james" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC7872" format="default"/>) suggest that there is widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain IPv6 EHs. In some cases, such packet drops occur at transit routers. While some operators are known to intentionally drop packets that contain IPv6 EHs, it is possible that some of the measured packet drops are the result of inappropriate advice in this area.</t>
      <t>This document analyzes both the general security implications of
   IPv6 EHs, as well as the security implications of
   specific EH and option types. It also provides advice on the
   filtering of IPv6 packets based on the IPv6 EHs and
   the IPv6 options they contain. Since
   various protocols may use IPv6 EHs (possibly with IPv6
   options), discarding packets based on the IPv6 EHs or
   IPv6 options they contain can have implications on the proper
   functioning of such protocols.  Thus, this document also attempts to
   discuss the operational and interoperability implications of such
   filtering policies.</t>
      <t>The resulting packet filtering policy typically depends on where in the network such policy is enforced. When the policy is enforced in a transit network, the policy typically follows a "deny-list" approach, where only packets with clear negative implications are dropped. On the other hand, when the policy is enforced closer to the destination systems, the policy typically follows an "accept-list" approach, where only traffic that is expected to be received is allowed. The advice in this document is aimed only at transit routers that may need to enforce a filtering policy based on the IPv6 EHs and IPv6 options a packet may contain, following a "deny-list" approach; hence, it is likely to be much more permissive than a filtering policy to be employed at, for example, the edge of an enterprise network. The advice in this document is meant to improve the current situation of the dropping of packets with IPv6 EHs in the Internet <xref target="RFC7872" format="default"/> in such cases where packets are being dropped due to inappropriate or missing guidelines.</t>
            <t>This document is similar in nature to
   <xref target="RFC7126" format="default"/>, which addresses the same problem for the IPv4 case. However, in IPv6, the problem space is compounded by the fact that IPv6 specifies a number of IPv6 EHs and a number of IPv6 options that may be valid only when included in specific EH types.</t>
      <t>This document completes and complements the considerations for protecting the control plane from packets containing IP options that can be found in <xref target="RFC6192" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t><xref target="terms" format="default"/> specifies the terminology and conventions employed throughout this document. <xref target="ipv6-extension-headers-discussion" format="default"/> discusses IPv6 EHs and provides advice in the area of filtering IPv6 packets that contain such IPv6 EHs. <xref target="ipv6-options-discussion" format="default"/> discusses IPv6 options and provides advice in the area of filtering IPv6 packets that contain such options.

        <name>Applicability Statement</name>
        <t>This document provides advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs at transit routers for traffic not explicitly destined to them, for cases in which such filtering is deemed as necessary.</t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Router Default Behavior and Features</name>
        <t>This document assumes that nodes comply with the requirements in <xref target="RFC7045" format="default"/>. Namely,
	</t>	
	
 <blockquote>If a forwarding node discards a packet containing a standard IPv6
   extension header, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the result of a configurable policy and
   not just the result of a failure to recognise such a header.  This
   means that the discard policy for each standard type of extension
   header <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be individually configurable.  The default configuration
   <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> allow all standard extension headers.</blockquote>
        <t>

	  The advice provided in this document is only meant to guide an operator in configuring forwarding devices and is not to be interpreted as advice regarding default configuration settings for network devices. That is, this document provides advice with respect to operational policies but does not change the implementation defaults required by <xref target="RFC7045" format="default"/>.

	  
</t>
        <t>We recommend that configuration options be made available to govern the processing of each IPv6 EH type and each IPv6 Option Type. Such configuration options should include the following possible settings:
	</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Permit this IPv6 EH or IPv6 Option Type.</li>
          <li>Drop packets containing this IPv6 EH or IPv6 Option Type.</li>
          <li>Reject packets containing this IPv6 EH or IPv6 Option Type (where the packet drop is signaled with an ICMPv6 error message).</li>
          <li>Rate-limit traffic containing this IPv6 EH or IPv6 Option Type.</li>
          <li>Ignore this IPv6 EH or IPv6 Option Type (as if it was not present), and process the packet according the rules for the remaining headers. We note that if a packet carries forwarding information (e.g., in an IPv6 Routing Header (RH)), this might be an inappropriate or undesirable action.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>We note that special care needs to be taken when devices log packet drops/rejects. Devices should count the number of packets dropped/rejected, but the logging of drop/reject events should be limited so as to not overburden device resources.</t>
        <t>Finally, we note that when discarding packets, it is generally desirable that the sender be signaled of the packet drop, since this is of use for trouble-shooting purposes. However, throughout this document (when recommending that packets be discarded), we generically refer to the action as "discard" without specifying whether the sender is signaled of the packet drop.</t>

        <name>General Discussion</name>
        <t>IPv6 EHs <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/> allow for the extension of the IPv6 protocol. Since both IPv6 EHs and upper-layer protocols share the same namespace ("Next Header" registry/namespace), <xref target="RFC7045" format="default"/> identifies which of the currently assigned Internet Protocol numbers identify IPv6 EHs vs. upper-layer protocols. This document discusses the filtering of packets based on the IPv6 EHs (as specified by <xref target="RFC7045" format="default"/>) they contain.
        </t>
	<t>
<xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/> specifies that non-fragmented IPv6 datagrams and IPv6 First-Fragments must contain the entire IPv6 header chain <xref target="RFC7112" format="default"/>. Therefore, intermediate systems can enforce the filtering policies discussed in this document or resort to simply discarding the offending packets when they fail to include the entire IPv6 header chain <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>. </t>

<t>
We note that in order to implement filtering rules on the fast path, it may be necessary for the filtering device to limit the depth into the packet that can be inspected before giving up. In circumstances where such
      a limitation exists, it is recommended that implementations provide a
      configuration option that specifies whether to discard packets if
      the aforementioned limit is encountered.  Operators may then
      determine, according to their own circumstances, how such packets
      will be handled.

For legacy nodes <xref target="RFC2460" format="default"/>, the recommended configuration for the processing of these packets depends on the features and capabilities of the underlying platform, the configuration of the platform, and also the deployment environment of the platform. On platforms that allow the forwarding of packets with IPv6 HBH Options headers on the fast path, we recommend that packets with IPv6 HBH Options headers be forwarded as normal. Otherwise, on platforms in which the processing of packets with IPv6 HBH Options headers is carried out in the slow path and an option is provided to rate-limit these packets, we recommend that this option be selected. Finally, when packets containing IPv6 HBH Options headers are processed in the slow path and the underlying platform does not have any mitigation options available for attacks based on these packets, we recommend that such platforms discard packets containing IPv6 HBH Options headers.</t>

            <t>Blocking packets containing Routing Headers of Routing Type 0 or Routing Type 1 has no operational implications, since both have been deprecated. Blocking packets containing Routing Headers of Routing Type 2 would break Mobile IPv6. Packets containing Routing Headers of Routing Type 3 may be safely blocked at RPL domain boundaries, since such headers are employed within a single RPL domain. Blocking packets containing Routing Headers of Routing Type 4 (SRH) will break Segment Routing (SR) deployments if the filtering policy is enforced on packets being forwarded within an SR domain.</t>

Essentially, packets that contain IPv6 options might need to be processed by an IPv6 router's general-purpose CPU and, hence, could present a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) risk to that router's general-purpose CPU (and thus to the router itself). For some architectures, a possible mitigation would be to rate-limit the packets that are to be processed by the general-purpose CPU (see, e.g., <xref target="Cisco-EH" format="default"/>).</t>

            <t>If packets with this option are discarded or if the option is
          stripped from the packet during transmission from source to
          destination, then the packet itself is likely to be discarded by the
          receiver because it is not properly labeled. In some cases, the
          receiver might receive the packet but associate an incorrect
          Sensitivity Label with the received data from the packet whose Common Architecture Label
	  IPv6 Security Option (CALIPSO)
          was stripped by a middlebox (such as a packet scrubber). Associating an
          incorrect Sensitivity Label can cause the received information
          to be handled either as more sensitive than it really is
          ("upgrading") or as less sensitive than it really is
            ("downgrading"), either of which is problematic. As noted in <xref target="RFC5570" format="default"/>, IPsec <xref target="RFC4301" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4302" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4303" format="default"/> can be employed to protect the CALIPSO.</t>

          <section numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Advice</name>
            <t>
Recommendations for handling the CALIPSO depend on the deployment environment rather than on whether an intermediate system 
  happens to be deployed as a transit device (e.g., IPv6 transit router).</t>
            <t>Explicit configuration is the only method via which an intermediate system
 can know whether that particular intermediate system has been 
 deployed within an MLS environment.  In many cases, 
 ordinary commercial intermediate systems (e.g., IPv6 routers and firewalls) 
 are the majority of the deployed intermediate systems inside an MLS 
 network environment. </t>
            <t>For intermediate systems that DO NOT implement <xref target="RFC5570" format="default"/>, there 
 should be a configuration option to either (a) drop packets containing 
 the CALIPSO or  (b) ignore the presence of the CALIPSO
 and forward the packets normally.  In non-MLS environments, such
 intermediate systems should have this configuration option set to (a)
 above.  In MLS environments, such intermediate systems should
 have this option set to (b) above.  The default setting for this configuration
 option should be set to (a) above, because MLS environments are much
 less common than non-MLS environments.
</t>
            <t>For intermediate systems that DO implement <xref target="RFC5570" format="default"/>, there should 
 be configuration options (a) and (b) from the preceding paragraph and 
 also a third configuration option (c) to process packets containing
 a CALIPSO as per <xref target="RFC5570" format="default"/>.  When deployed in non-MLS
 environments, such intermediate systems should have this configuration
 option set to (a) above.  When deployed in MLS environments, such
 intermediate systems should have this configuration option set to (c).  The default setting
 for this configuration option <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be set to (a) above, because MLS 
 environments are much less common than non-MLS environments.

This document provides advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets that contain IPv6 EHs (and possibly IPv6 options) at IPv6 transit routers. It is meant to improve the current situation of widespread dropping of such IPv6 packets in those cases where the drops result from improper configuration defaults or inappropriate advice in this area.
</t>
      <t>
   As discussed in <xref target="ipv6-ehs-rationale" format="default"/>, one of the
   underlying principles for the advice provided in this document is
   that IPv6 packets with specific EHs or options that may represent an
   attack vector for infrastructure devices should be dropped. While
   this policy helps mitigate some specific attack vectors, the
   recommendations in this document will not help to mitigate
   vulnerabilities based on implementation errors <xref target="RFC9098" format="default"/>. 
</t>
      <t>We also note that depending on the router architecture, attempts to filter packets based on the presence of IPv6 EHs or options might itself represent an attack vector to network infrastructure devices <xref target="RFC9098" format="default"/>.</t>

<title>Using RPI Option Type, Routing Header for Source Routes, and IPv6-in-IPv6 Encapsulation in the RPL Data Plane</title>

<date year='2021' month='April' />
<abstract><t>This document looks at different data flows through Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLN) where RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is used to establish routing. The document enumerates the cases where RPL Packet Information (RPI) Option Type (RFC 6553), RPL Source Route Header (RFC 6554), and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation are required in the data plane. This analysis provides the basis upon which to design efficient compression of these headers. This document updates RFC 6553 by adding a change to the RPI Option Type. Additionally, this document updates RFC 6550 by defining a flag in the DODAG Information Object (DIO) Configuration option to indicate this change and updates RFC 8138 as well to consider the new Option Type when the RPL Option is decompressed.</t></abstract>
