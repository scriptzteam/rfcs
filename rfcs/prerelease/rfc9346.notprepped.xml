      <t>This document describes extensions to the Intermediate System to
      Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol to support Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)
      for multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes). It defines IS-IS extensions for
      the flooding of TE information about inter-AS links, which can be used
      to perform inter-AS TE path computation.</t>
      <t>No support for flooding information from within one AS to another AS
      is proposed or defined in this document.</t>
      <t> This document builds on RFC 5316 by adding support for IPv6-only
      operation.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/> defines extensions to the IS-IS protocol
      <xref target="RFC1195" format="default"/> to support intra-area Traffic Engineering (TE).
      The extensions provide a way of encoding the TE information for
      TE-enabled links within the network (TE links) and flooding this
      information within an area. The extended IS reachability TLV and Traffic
      Engineering router ID TLV, which are defined in <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/>, are used to carry such TE information. The extended
      IS reachability TLV has several nested sub-TLVs that describe the TE
      attributes for a TE link.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC6119" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC5307" format="default"/> define similar
      extensions to IS-IS in support of IPv6 and
      GMPLS TE, respectively.</t>
      <t>Requirements for establishing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE
      Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that cross multiple Autonomous Systems
      (ASes) are described in <xref target="RFC4216" format="default"/>. As described in <xref target="RFC4216" format="default"/>, a method <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide the ability to compute a
      path spanning multiple ASes. So a path computation entity that may be
      the head-end Label Switching Router (LSR), an AS Border Router (ASBR),
      or a Path Computation Element (PCE) <xref target="RFC4655" format="default"/> needs to
      know the TE information not only of the links within an AS but also of
      the links that connect to other ASes.</t>
      <t>In this document, the Inter-AS
      Reachability Information TLV is defined to advertise inter-AS TE information, and
      four sub-TLVs are defined for inclusion in the Inter-AS Reachability
      Information TLV to carry the information about the Remote AS Number, Remote
      ASBR Identifier, and IPv6 Local ASBR Identifier. The sub-TLVs defined in
      <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC6119" format="default"/>,
      and other documents for inclusion in the extended IS reachability TLV
      for describing the TE properties of a TE link are applicable to be
      included in the Inter-AS Reachability Information TLV for describing the TE
      properties of an inter-AS TE link as well. Also, two more sub-TLVs
      are defined for inclusion in the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV to carry
      the TE Router ID when the TE Router ID is needed to reach all routers
      within an entire IS-IS routing domain. The extensions are equally
      applicable to
      IPv4 and IPv6 as identical extensions to <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/> and
      <xref target="RFC6119" format="default"/>. Detailed definitions and procedures are
      discussed in the following sections.</t>
      <t>This document does not propose or define any mechanisms to advertise
      any other extra-AS TE information within IS-IS. See <xref target="non-objectives" format="default"/> for a
      full list of non-objectives for this work.</t>

      <name>Problem Statement</name>
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC4216" format="default"/>, in the case of establishing
      an inter-AS TE LSP that traverses multiple ASes, the Path message <xref target="RFC3209" format="default"/> may include the following elements in the Explicit
      Route Object (ERO) in order to describe the path of the LSP:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>a set of AS numbers as loose hops and/or</li>
        <li>a set of LSRs including ASBRs as loose hops.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Two methods for determining inter-AS paths have been described
      elsewhere. The per-domain method <xref target="RFC5152" format="default"/> determines the
      path one domain at a time. The backward-recursive method <xref target="RFC5441" format="default"/> uses cooperation between PCEs to determine an optimum
      inter-domain path. The sections that follow examine how inter-AS TE link
      information could be useful in both cases.</t>

        <name>Per-Domain Path Determination</name>
        <t>In the per-domain method of determining an inter-AS path for an
        MPLS-TE LSP, when an LSR that is an entry-point to an AS receives a
        Path message from an upstream AS with an ERO containing a next hop
        that is an AS number, it needs to find which LSRs (ASBRs) within the
        local AS are connected to the downstream AS. That way, it can compute
        a TE LSP segment across the local AS to one of those LSRs and forward
        the Path message to that LSR and hence into the next AS. See Figure 1
        for an example.</t>

]]></artwork>
	</figure>
        <t>The figure shows three ASes (AS1, AS2, and AS3) and twelve
        LSRs (R1 through R12). R3 and R4 are ASBRs in AS1. R5, R6, R7, and R8
        are ASBRs in AS2. R9 and R10 are ASBRs in AS3.</t>
        <t>If an inter-AS TE LSP is planned to be established from R1 to R12,
        the AS sequence will be: AS1, AS2, AS3.</t>
        <t>Suppose that the Path message enters AS2 from R3. The next hop in
        the ERO shows AS3, and R5 must determine a path segment across AS2 to
        reach AS3. It has a choice of three exit points from AS2 (R6, R7, and
        R8), and it needs to know which of these provide TE connectivity to
        AS3 and whether the TE connectivity (for example, available
        bandwidth) is adequate for the requested LSP.</t>
        <t>Alternatively, if the next hop in the ERO is an entry ASBR for AS3
        (say R9), R5 needs to know which of its exit ASBRs has a TE link that
        connects to R9. Since there may be multiple ASBRs that are connected
        to R9 (both R7 and R8 in this example), R5 also needs to know the TE
        properties of the inter-AS TE links so that it can select the correct
        exit ASBR.</t>
        <t>Once the Path message reaches the exit ASBR, any choice of inter-AS
        TE link can be made by the ASBR if not already made by the entry ASBR
        that computed the segment.</t>
        <t>More details can be found in <xref target="RFC5152" section="4" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>,
        which clearly points out why advertising of inter-AS links is
        desired.</t>
        <t>To enable R5 to make the correct choice of exit ASBR, the following
        information is needed:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>List of all inter-AS TE links for the local AS.</li>
          <li>TE properties of each inter-AS TE link.</li>
          <li>AS number of the neighboring AS connected to by each inter-AS
            TE link.</li>
          <li>Identity (TE Router ID) of the neighboring ASBR connected to by
            each inter-AS TE link.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>In GMPLS networks, further information may also be required
        to select the correct TE links as defined in <xref target="RFC5307" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The example above shows how this information is needed at the
        entry-point ASBRs for each AS (or the PCEs that provide computation
        services for the ASBRs). However, this information is also needed
        throughout the local AS if path computation functionality is fully
        distributed among LSRs in the local AS, for example, to support LSPs
        that have start points (ingress nodes) within the AS.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Backward-Recursive Path Computation</name>
        <t>Another scenario using PCE techniques has the same problem. <xref target="RFC5441" format="default"/> defines a PCE-based TE LSP computation method
        (called "Backward-Recursive Path Computation (BRPC)") to compute optimal
        inter-domain constrained MPLS-TE or GMPLS LSPs. In this path
        computation method, a specific set of traversed domains (ASes) are
        assumed to be selected before computation starts. Each downstream PCE
        in domain(i) returns to its upstream neighbor PCE in domain(i-1) a
        multipoint-to-point tree of potential paths. Each tree consists of the
        set of paths from all boundary nodes located in domain(i) to the
        destination where each path satisfies the set of required constraints
        for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities, etc.).</t>
        <t>So a PCE needs to select boundary nodes (that is, ASBRs) that
        provide connectivity from the upstream AS. In order for the tree of
        paths provided by one PCE to its neighbor to be correlated, the
        identities of the ASBRs for each path need to be referenced. Thus, the
        PCE must know the identities of the ASBRs in the remote AS that are
        reached by any inter-AS TE link, and, in order to provide only
        suitable paths in the tree, the PCE must know the TE properties of the
        inter-AS TE links. See the following figure as an example.</t>

             <-- AS1 -->:<---- AS2 --->:<--- AS3 --->
]]></artwork>
	</figure>
        <t>The figure shows three ASes (AS1, AS2, and AS3), three PCEs (PCE1,
        PCE2, and PCE3), and twelve LSRs (R1 through R12). R3 and R4 are ASBRs
        in AS1. R5, R6, R7, and R8 are ASBRs in AS2. R9 and R10 are ASBRs in
        AS3. PCE1, PCE2, and PCE3 cooperate to perform inter-AS path
        computation and are responsible for path segment computation within
        their own domain(s).</t>
        <t>   If an inter-AS TE LSP is planned to be established from R1 to R12,
	the traversed domains are assumed to be selected (AS1-&gt;AS2-&gt;AS3), and
	the PCE chain is PCE1-&gt;PCE2-&gt;PCE3. First, the path
        computation request originated from the Path Computation Client (PCC) (R1) is relayed by PCE1
        and PCE2 along the PCE chain to PCE3. Then, PCE3 begins to compute the
        path segments from the entry boundary nodes that provide connection
        from AS2 to the destination (R12). But, to provide suitable path
        segments, PCE3 must determine which entry boundary nodes provide
        connectivity to its upstream neighbor AS (identified by its AS
        number) and must know the TE properties of the inter-AS TE links. In
        the same way, PCE2 also needs to determine the entry boundary nodes
        according to its upstream neighbor AS and the inter-AS TE link
        capabilities.</t>
        <t>Thus, to support BRPC, the same
        information listed in <xref target="determiniation" format="default"/> is required. The AS number of the
        neighboring AS connected to by each inter-AS TE link is particularly
        important.</t>

   <t>Compared to the extended IS reachability TLV, which is defined
        in <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/>, the Inter-AS Reachability Information TLV replaces
        the "7 octets of System ID and Pseudonode Number" field with a "4
        octets of Router ID" field and introduces an extra "control
        information" field, which consists of a flooding-scope bit (S bit), an
        up/down bit (D bit), and 6 reserved bits.</t>
        <t>The Router ID field of the Inter-AS Reachability Information TLV is 4 octets in
        length and has a value as defined in <xref target="_RID" format="default"/>. If the
        originating node does not support IPv4, then the reserved value
        0.0.0.0 <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used in the Router ID field, and the IPv6 Router ID
        sub-TLV <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present in the Inter-AS Reachability Information TLV. The Router
        ID could be used to indicate the source of the Inter-AS Reachability
        Information TLV.</t>
        <t>The flooding procedures for the Inter-AS Reachability Information TLV are identical
        to the flooding procedures for the GENINFO TLV, which are defined in
        <xref target="RFC6823" section="4" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>. These procedures have been
        previously discussed in <xref target="RFC7981" format="default"/>. The flooding-scope
        bit (S bit) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be set to 0 if the flooding scope is to be limited
        to within the single IGP area to which the ASBR belongs. It <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be set
        to 1 if the information is intended to reach all routers (including
        area border routers, ASBRs, and PCEs) in the entire IS-IS routing
        domain. The choice between the use of 0 or 1 is an AS-wide policy
        choice, and configuration control <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be provided in ASBR
        implementations that support the advertisement of inter-AS TE
        links.</t>
        <t>The sub-TLVs defined in <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC6119" format="default"/>, and other documents for describing the TE
        properties of a TE link are also applicable to the Inter-AS
        Reachability Information TLV for describing the TE properties of an inter-AS TE
        link. Apart from these sub-TLVs, four sub-TLVs are defined for
        inclusion in the Inter-AS Reachability Information TLV defined in this

      usage of the link, and configuration at the ASBR of the Remote AS Number
      and remote ASBR TE Router ID.</t>
      <t>Legacy routers receiving an advertisement for an inter-AS TE link are
      able to ignore it because they do not know the TLV and sub-TLVs that
      are defined in <xref target="_SOL" format="default"/> of this document. They will continue to flood
      the LSP but will not attempt to use the information received.</t>
      <t>In the current operation of IS-IS TE, the LSRs at each end of a TE
      link emit LSPs describing the link. The databases in the LSRs then have
      two entries (one locally generated, the other from the peer) that
      describe the different 'directions' of the link. This enables
      Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) to do a two-way check on the link
      when performing path computation and eliminate it from consideration
      unless both directions of the link satisfy the required constraints.</t>
      <t>In the case we are considering here (i.e., of a TE link to another
      AS), there is, by definition, no IGP peering and hence no bidirectional
      TE link information. In order for the CSPF route computation entity to
      include the link as a candidate path, we have to find a way to get LSPs
      describing its (bidirectional) TE properties into the TE database.</t>
      <t>This is achieved by the ASBR advertising, internally to its AS,
      information about both directions of the TE link to the next AS. The
      ASBR will normally generate an LSP describing its own side of a link;
      here, we have it 'proxy' for the ASBR at the edge of the other AS and
      generate an additional LSP that describes that device's 'view' of the
      link.</t>
      <t>Only some essential TE information for the link needs to be
      advertised, i.e., the Interface Address, the Remote AS Number, and the
      Remote ASBR Identifier of an inter-AS TE link.</t>
      <t>Routers or PCEs that are capable of processing advertisements of
      inter-AS TE links <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> use such links to compute paths that exit
      an AS to a remote ASBR and then immediately re-enter the AS through
      another TE link. Such paths would constitute extremely rare occurrences
      and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be allowed except as the result of specific policy
      configurations at the router or PCE computing the path.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default" anchor="te-info">
        <name>Origin of Proxied TE Information</name>
        <t><xref target="_Procedure" format="default"/> describes how an ASBR advertises TE link information as a
        proxy for its neighbor ASBR but does not describe where this
        information comes from.</t>
        <t>Although the source of the information described in <xref target="_Procedure" format="default"/>
	is outside the scope of
        this document, it is possible that it will be a configuration
        requirement at the ASBR, as are other local properties of the TE link.
        Further, where BGP is used to exchange IP routing information between
        the ASBRs, a certain amount of additional local configuration about
        the link and the remote ASBR is likely to be available.</t>
        <t>We note further that it is possible, and may be operationally
        advantageous, to obtain some of the required configuration information
        from BGP. Whether and how to utilize these possibilities is an
        implementation matter.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>      
      <t>The protocol extensions defined in this document are relatively minor
      and can be secured within the AS in which they are used by the existing
      IS-IS security mechanisms (e.g., using the cleartext passwords or Hashed
      Message Authentication Codes,
      which are defined in <xref target="RFC1195" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC5304" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC5310" format="default"/> separately).</t>
      <t>There is no exchange of information between ASes and no change to
      the IS-IS security relationship between the ASes. In particular, since
      no IS-IS adjacency is formed on the inter-AS links, there is no
      requirement for IS-IS security between the ASes.</t>
      <t>Some of the information included in these advertisements (e.g.,
      the Remote AS Number and the Remote ASBR Identifier) is obtained manually from a
      neighboring administration as part of a commercial relationship. The
      source and content of this information should be carefully checked
      before it is entered as configuration information at the ASBR
      responsible for advertising the inter-AS TE links.</t>
      <t>It is worth noting that, in the scenario we are considering, a Border
      Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering may exist between the two ASBRs and that
      this could be used to detect inconsistencies in configuration (e.g., the
      administration that originally supplied the information may provide
      incorrect information, or
      some manual misconfigurations or mistakes may be made by the
      operators). For example, if a different Remote AS Number is received in
      a BGP OPEN <xref target="RFC4271" format="default"/> from that locally configured to
      IS-IS TE, as we describe here, then local policy <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be applied to
      determine whether to alert the operator to a potential misconfiguration
      or to suppress the IS-IS advertisement of the inter-AS TE link.
      Advertisement of incorrect information could result in an inter-AS TE
      LSP that traverses an unintended AS. Note
      further that, if BGP is used to exchange TE information as described in
      <xref target="te-info" format="default"/>, the inter-AS BGP session <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be secured using mechanisms
      such as described in <xref target="RFC5925" format="default"/> to provide authentication
      and integrity checks.</t>

      <name>Changes to RFC 5316</name>
      <t>The following is a summary of the substantive changes this document
      makes to RFC 5316. Some editorial changes were also made.</t>
      <t>RFC 5316 only allowed a 32-bit Router ID in the fixed header of TLV
      141. This is problematic in an IPv6-only deployment where an IPv4
      address may not be available. This document specifies:</t>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>The Router ID should be identical to the value advertised in the
      Traffic Engineering router ID TLV (134) if available.</li>
      <li>If no Traffic Engineering Router ID is assigned, the Router ID
      should be identical to an IP Interface Address <xref target="RFC1195" format="default"/> advertised by
      the originating IS.</li>
      <li>If the originating node does not support IPv4, then the reserved
      value 0.0.0.0 must be used in the Router ID field and the IPv6 Local
      ASBR Identifier sub-TLV must be present in the TLV.</li>
