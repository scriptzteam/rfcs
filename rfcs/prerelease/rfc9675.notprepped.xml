   <abstract>
      <t>
        The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture describes a type of
        challenged network in which communications may be significantly
        affected by long signal propagation delays, frequent link disruptions, 
        or both. The unique characteristics of this environment require a 
        unique approach to network management that supports asynchronous
        transport, autonomous local control, and a small footprint (in both
        resources and dependencies) so as to deploy on constrained devices. 
      </t>

      <t>
        This document describes a DTN Management Architecture (DTNMA) suitable
        for managing devices in any challenged environment but, in
        particular, those communicating using the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP). 
        Operating over BP requires an architecture that neither presumes
        synchronized transport behavior nor relies on query-response mechanisms. 
        Implementations compliant with this DTNMA should expect to successfully
        operate in extremely challenging conditions, such as over unidirectional 
        links and other places where BP is the preferred transport.

      <t>
        This document describes a logical, informational Delay-Tolerant Networking Management Architecture (DTNMA) suitable for operating devices in a 
        challenged architecture, such as those communicating 
        using the DTN Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) <xref target="RFC9171"/>. 
      </t> 

      <t>
        Challenged networks have certain properties that differentiate them
        from other kinds of networks. These properties, outlined in 
        <xref target="RFC7228" sectionFormat="of" section="2.2.1"/>,
        include lacking 
        end-to-end IP connectivity, having "serious interruptions"
        to end-to-end connectivity, and exhibiting delays longer than can be
        tolerated by end-to-end synchronization mechanisms (such as TCP).
      </t>

      <t>
        These challenged network properties can be caused by a variety of factors 
        such as physical constraints (e.g., long signal propagation delays 
        and frequent link disruptions), administrative policies (e.g., 
        quality-of-service prioritization, service-level agreements, and 
        traffic management and scheduling), and off-nominal behaviors 
        (e.g., active attackers and misconfigurations). Since these 
        challenges are not solely caused by sparseness, instances of 
        challenged networks will persist even in increasingly connected 
        environments. 
      </t>

      <t>
        The DTN architecture, described in 
        <xref target="RFC4838"/>, has been designed for data exchange 
        in challenged networks. Just as the DTN architecture requires new 
        capabilities for transport and transport security, special consideration 
        is needed for the operation of devices in a challenged network.
      </t>

      <section numbered="true">
        <name>Purpose</name>
        <t>
          This document describes how challenged network properties 
          affect the operation of devices in such networks. This 
          description is presented as a logical architecture
          formed from a union of best practices for operating 
          devices deployed in challenged environments. 
        </t>

        <t>
          One important practice captured in this document is the concept of self-operation.  Self-operation involves operating 
          a device without human interactivity, without system-in-the-loop 
          synchronous functions, and without a synchronous underlying 
          transport layer. This means that devices determine 
          their own schedules for data reporting, determine their own 
          operational configuration, and perform their own error 
          discovery and mitigation.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section numbered="true">
        <name>Scope</name>
        <t>
          This document includes the information necessary to document 
          existing practices for operating devices in a challenged network in
          the context of a logical architecture. A logical architecture 
          describes the logical operation of a system by identifying 
          components of the system (such as in a reference model), 
          the behaviors they enable, and use cases describing how 
          those behaviors result in the desired operation of the system. 
        </t>
    
        <t>
          Logical architectures are not functional architectures. Therefore,
          any functional design for achieving desired behaviors is out of 
          scope for this document. The set of architectural principles presented here is not meant to completely specify interfaces between components.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          The selection of any particular transport or network layer is outside 
          of the scope of this document. The DTNMA does not require the use of
          any specific protocol such as IP, BP, TCP, or UDP. In particular, the 
          DTNMA design does not presume the use of BPv7, IPv4, or IPv6. 
        </t>

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: As BPv7 is the preferred transport for networks conforming to the DTN architecture, the DTNMA should be considered for any BPv7 network deployment. However, the DTNMA may also be used in other networks that have similar needs for this particular style of self-operation. For this reason, the DTNMA does not require the use of BPv7 to transport management information.
          </t>
        </aside>

        <t>
          Network features such as naming, addressing, routing, and 
          communications security are out of scope for the DTNMA. It is 
          presumed that any operational network communicating DTNMA 
          messages would implement these services for any payloads carried 
          by that network. 
        </t>

       <t>
          The interactions between and amongst the DTNMA and other management
          approaches are outside of the scope of this document.

      <dl>
        <dt>Timely Data Exchange:</dt>
        <dd>
          The ability to communicate information between two (or more)
          entities within a required period of time. In some cases, a 1-second exchange may not 
          be timely; in other cases, a 1-hour exchange may be timely. 
        </dd>

        <dt>Local Operation:</dt>
        <dd>
          The operation of a device by an application co-resident on that device. 
          Local operators are applications running on a device, and there 
          might be one or more of these applications working independently or as one
          to perform the local operations function. Absent error conditions, local
          operators are always expected to be available to the devices they manage.
        </dd>

        <dt>Remote Operation:</dt>
        <dd>
          The operation of a device by an application running on a separate
          device. Remote operators communicate with operated devices over a network. 
          Remote operators are not always expected to be available to the devices they 
          operate.
        </dd>

        <dt>DTN Management:</dt>
        <dd>
          The management, monitoring, and control of a device that does not depend on stateful connections, timely data exchange of management messages, 
          or system-in-the-loop synchronous functions. DTN management is accomplished as
          a fusion of local operation and remote operation techniques; remote operators manage the configuration of local operators who
          provide monitoring and control of their co-resident devices.

        <dd>
          A role associated with a managed device
          responsible for reporting performance data, accepting policy
          directives, performing autonomous local control, error handling, and
          data validation. DAs exchange information with DTNMA Managers (DMs) operating
          on the same device and/or on remote devices in the network. A DA is
          a type of local operator.

        <dd>
          A role associated with a managing device 
          responsible for configuring the behavior of, and eventually receiving 
          information from, DAs. DMs interact with one or more DAs located on 
          the same device and/or on remote devices in the network. A DM is a
          type of remote operator.

          Procedures run by a DA to change the behavior, 
          configuration, or state of an application or protocol managed by 
          that DA. These include procedures to manage the DA itself, such as

        <dt>Externally Defined Data (EDD):</dt>
        <dd>

        <dd>
          A typed, ordered collection of data values gathered 
          by one or more DAs and provided to one or more DMs. Reports comply
          with the format of a given data report schema.

        The DTNMA provides network management services able to operate in
        challenged network environments for which the DTN 
        architecture was created. This section describes what is meant by the term 
        "challenged network", the important properties of such a network, and 
        observations on impacts to management approaches.
      </t>

      <section>
        <name>Challenged Network Constraints</name>
        <t>
          Constrained networks are defined as networks where "some of the 
          characteristics pretty much taken for granted with link layers in 
          common use in the Internet at the time of writing are not attainable"
          <xref target="RFC7228"/>. This broad definition captures a variety of 
          potential issues relating to physical, technical, and regulatory 
          constraints on message transmission. Constrained networks 
          typically include nodes that regularly reboot or are otherwise turned 
          off for long periods of time, transmit at low or asynchronous bitrates, 
          and/or have very limited computational resources.
        </t>

        <t>  
          Separately, a challenged network is defined as one that "has serious 
          trouble maintaining what an application would today expect of the 
          end-to-end IP model" <xref target="RFC7228"/>. Links in such networks may 
          be impacted by attenuation, propagation delays, mobility, 
          occultation, and other limitations imposed by energy and 
          mass considerations. Therefore, systems relying on such links cannot 
          guarantee timely end-to-end data exchange.
        </t>

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: Because challenged networks might not provide services expected of 
            the end-to-end IP model, devices in such networks might not implement
            networking stacks associated with the end-to-end IP model. This
            means that devices might not include support for certain
            transport protocols (TCP/QUIC/UDP), web protocols (HTTP), or  
            internetworking protocols (IPv4/IPv6). 
          </t>
        </aside>

        <t>
          By these definitions, a "challenged" network is a special type of
          "constrained" network, where constraints prevent timely end-to-end
          data exchange. As such, "All challenged networks are 
          constrained networks ... but not all constrained networks are 
          challenged networks ... Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) has been 
          designed to cope with challenged networks" <xref target="RFC7228"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          Solutions that work in constrained networks might not be solutions
          that work in challenged networks. In particular, challenged networks 
          exhibit the following properties that impact the way in which the 
          function of network management is considered. 
        </t>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            Timely end-to-end data exchange cannot be guaranteed to exist at any given time

      <section numbered="true">
        <name>Topology and Service Implications</name>

        <t>
          The set of constraints that might be present in a challenged network
          impacts both the topology of the network and the services active 
          within that network.
        </t>

        <t>
          Operational networks handle cases where nodes join and leave the 
          network over time. These topology changes may or may not be planned, they
          may or may not represent errors, and they may or may not impact network 
          services. Challenged networks differ from other networks not in
          the presence of topological change but in the likelihood that impacts
          to topology result in impacts to network services. 
        </t>

        <t>
          The difference between topology impacts and service impacts can be
          expressed in terms of connectivity. Topological connectivity usually 
          refers to the existence of a path between an application message 
          source and destination. Service connectivity, alternatively, refers 
          to the existence of a path between a node and one or more services 
          needed to process -- often just in time -- application messaging. 
          Examples of service connectivity include access to infrastructure 
          services such as a Domain Name System (DNS) or a CA.
        </t>

        <t>
          In networks that might be partitioned most of the time, it is less
          likely that a node would concurrently access both an application 
          endpoint and one or more network service endpoints. For this reason, 
          network services in a challenged network should be designed to allow
          for asynchronous operation. Accommodating this use case often 
          involves the use of local caching, pre-placing information, and
          not hard-coding message information at a source that might change when a
          message reaches its destination.

            NOTE: One example of rethinking services in a challenged network
            is the securing of BPv7 bundles. The Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec) <xref target="RFC9172"/> security extensions to BPv7
            do not encode security destinations when 
            applying security. Instead, BPSec requires nodes in a network to 
            identify themselves as security verifiers or acceptors when receiving 
            and processing secured messages.

          <name>Tiered Management</name>

          <t>
            Network operations and management approaches need to adapt to the 
            topology and service impacts encountered in challenged networks. 
            In particular, the roles and responsibilities of "managers" and 
            "agents" need to be different than what would be expected of
            unchallenged networks.
          </t>

          <t>
            When connectivity to a manager cannot be guaranteed, agents will need to rely 
            on locally available information and local autonomy to react to
            changes at the node. When an agent uses local autonomy for self-operation, 
            it acts as a local operator serving as a proxy for an absent remote operator. 
          </t>

          <t>
            Therefore, the role of a "manager" must become one of a remote operator generating configurations and other essential updates for
            the local operator "agents" that are co-resident on a managed device. 
          </t>

          <t>
            This approach creates a two-tiered management architecture. The 
            first tier is the management of the local operator configuration
            using any one of a variety of standard mechanisms, models, and 
            protocols. The second tier is the operation of the local device 
            through the local operator.
          </t>

          <t>
            The DTNMA defines the DTNMA Manager (DM) as a remote operator application and the
            DTNMA Agent (DA) as an agent acting as a local operator application.
            In this model, which is illustrated in <xref target="two_tiered_model"/>, the 
            DM and DA can be viewed as applications, with the DM producing new configurations
            and the DA receiving those configurations from an underlying management mechanism. 
          </t>

          <t>
            In this approach, the configurations produced by the DM are
            based on the DA features and associated data model.  How those
            configurations are transported between the DM and the DA, and
            how results are communicated back from the DA to the DM, can
            be accomplished using whatever mechanism is most appropriate
            for the network and the device platforms -- for example, the
            use of a  Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), RESTCONF, or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server on the managed device 
            to provide configurations to a DA.

            In addition to disconnectivity, topological change can alter the
            associations amongst managed and managing devices. Different managing
            devices might be active in a network at different times or in 
            different partitions. Managed devices might communicate with some, all,
            or none of these managing devices as a function of their own local
            configuration and policy.

              NOTE: These concepts relate to practices in conventional networks. 
              For example, supporting multiple managing devices is similar to 
              deploying multiple instances of a network service such as a DNS 
              server or CA node. Selecting from a set of managing devices is 
              similar to a sensor node's practice of electing cluster heads to act 
              as privileged nodes for data storage and exfiltration.

        <name>Management Special Cases</name>

        <t>
          The following special cases illustrate some of the operational
          situations that can be encountered in the management of devices in
          a challenged network. 
        </t>

        <dl>
          <dt>One-Way Management:</dt>
          <dd>
            A managed device can only be accessed via a
            unidirectional link or via a link whose duration is shorter
            than a single round-trip propagation time. Results of this management may come back at a different time, over a 
            different path, and/or as observable from out-of-band changes to
            device behavior.
          </dd>

          <dt>Summary Data:</dt>
          <dd>
            A managing device might only receive summary data regarding
            a managed device's state because a link or path is constrained by
            capacity or reliability.
          </dd>
          
          <dt>Bulk Historical Reporting:</dt>
          <dd>
            A managing device receives a large volume 
            of historical report data for a managed device. This can occur when 
            a managed device rejoins a network or has temporary access to a
            high-capacity link (or path) between itself and the managing device.
          </dd>
          
          <dt>Multiple Managers:</dt>
          <dd>
            A managed device tracks multiple managers in 
            the network and communicates with them as a function of time,
            local state, or network topology. This scenario would also apply to challenged 
            networks that interconnect two or more unchallenged networks such 
            that managed and managing devices exist in different networks.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
          These special cases highlight the need for managed devices to operate
          without presupposing a dedicated connection to a single managing
          device. Managing devices in a challenged 
          network might never expect a reply to a command, and communications from
          managed devices may be delivered much later than the events being reported.

      <name>Desirable Design Properties</name>

      <t>
        This section describes those design properties that are desirable when 
        defining a management architecture operating across challenged 
        links in a network. These properties ensure that network management 
        capabilities are retained even as delays and disruptions in the 
        network scale. Ultimately, these properties are the driving design 
        principles for the DTNMA.   
      </t>

      <aside>
        <t>
          NOTE: These properties may influence the design, construction, and 
          adaptation of existing management tools for use in challenged
          networks. For example, the properties of the DTN architecture 
          <xref target="RFC4838"/> resulted in the development of BPv7
          <xref target="RFC9171"/> and BPSec <xref target="RFC9172"/>.
          Implementing the DTNMA model may result in the construction of new management data models,
          policy expressions, and/or protocols.

      <section numbered="true">
        <name>Dynamic Architectures</name>
        <t> 
          The DTNMA should be agnostic to the underlying physical topology,
          transport protocols, security solutions, and supporting infrastructure
          of a given network. Due to the likelihood of operating in a frequently
          partitioned environment, the topology of a network may change
          over time. Attempts to stabilize an architecture around individual
          nodes can result in a brittle management framework and the creation
          of congestion points during periods of connectivity.
        </t>

        <t>
          The DTNMA should not prescribe any association between a 
          DM and a DA other than those defined in this document. 
          There should be no logical limitation on the number of DMs 
          that can control a DA, the number of DMs that a DA should report to, 
          or any requirement that a DM and DA relationship imply a pair.
        </t>

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: Practical limitations on the relationships between and 
            amongst DMs and DAs will exist as a function of the capabilities of 
            networked devices. These limitations derive from processing and storage 
            constraints, performance requirements, and other engineering factors. 
            Implementors of managed and managing devices must account for these
            limitations in their device designs.

        <name> Hierarchically Modeled Information</name>

        <t>
          The DTNMA should use data models to define the syntactic and
          semantic contracts for data exchange between a DA and a DM. A given
          model should have the ability to "inherit" the contents of other
          models to form hierarchical data relationships. 
        </t>

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: The term "data model" in this context refers to a schema that
            defines a contract between a DA and a DM regarding how information is
            represented and validated. 
          </t>
        </aside>

        <t> 
          Many network management solutions use data models to specify the 
          semantic and syntactic representation of data exchanged between 
          managed and managing devices. The DTNMA is not different in 
          this regard; information exchanged between DAs and DMs should 
          conform to one or more predefined, normative data models.
        </t>

        <t>
          A common best practice when defining a data model is to make it cohesive.
          A cohesive model is one that includes information related to a single 
          purpose such as managing a single application or protocol. When
          applying this practice, it is not uncommon to develop a large number
          of small data models that, together, describe the information needed
          to manage a device. 
        </t>

        <t>
          Another best practice for data model development is the use of
          inclusion mechanisms to allow one data model to include information
          from another data model. This ability to include a data model avoids
          repeating information in different data models. When one data
          model includes information from another data model, there is an
          implied model hierarchy.
        </t>

        <t>
          Data models in the DTNMA should allow for the construction of both
          cohesive models and hierarchically related models. These data models 
          should be used to define all sources of information that can 
          be retrieved, configured, or executed in the DTNMA. These actions would include
          supporting DA autonomy functions such as parameterization, 
          filtering, and event-driven behaviors. These models will be used to both 
          implement interoperable autonomy engines on DAs and define 
          interoperable report parsing mechanisms on DMs.

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: While data model hierarchies can result in a more concise
            data model, arbitrarily complex nesting schemes can also result in
            very verbose encodings. Where possible, data identification 
            schemes should be constructed that allow for both hierarchical
            data and highly compressible data identification.

        <name>Adaptive Push of Information</name>
        
        <t>
          DAs in the DTNMA should determine when to push 
          information to DMs as a function of their local state.
        </t>

        <t> 
          "Pull" management mechanisms require a managing device to send a query 
          to a managed device and then wait for a response to that specific 
          query. This practice implies some knowledge synchronization between 
          entities (which may be as simple as knowing when a managed device might be powered). However, challenged networks 
          cannot guarantee timely round-trip data exchange. For this reason, 
          pull mechanisms should be avoided in the DTNMA.
        </t>

        <t>
          "Push" mechanisms, in this context, indicate the ability of DAs to 
          leverage local autonomy to determine when and what information
          should be sent to which DMs. The push is considered adaptive 
          because a DA determines what information to push (and when) as
          an adaptation to changes to the DA's internal state. Once pushed, 
          information might still be queued, pending connectivity of the DA 
          to the network.
        </t>

          <t>
            Even in cases where a round-trip exchange can occur, pull
            mechanisms increase the overall amount of traffic in the network 
            and preclude the use of autonomy at managed devices. So, even when
            pull mechanisms are feasible, they should not be considered a 
            pragmatic alternative to push mechanisms.

        <name>Efficient Data Encoding</name>
        <t> 
          Messages exchanged between a DA and a DM in the DTNMA should be
          defined in a way that allows for efficient on-the-wire encoding. 
          DTNMA design decisions that result in smaller message sizes 
          should be preferred over those that result in larger message sizes.
        </t>

        <t>
          There is a relationship between message encoding and message 
          processing time at a node. Messages with few or no encodings may
          simplify node processing, whereas more compact encodings may require
          additional activities to generate/parse encoded messages. Generally,
          compressing a message takes processing time at the sender and 
          decompressing a message takes processing time at a receiver. 
          Therefore, there is a design trade-off between minimizing message 
          sizes and minimizing node processing. 
        </t>
      
        <t>
          There is a significant advantage to smaller DTNMA message sizes 
          in a challenged network. Smaller messages require shorter periods of 
          viable transmission for communication, they incur less 
          retransmission cost, and they consume fewer resources when 
          persistently stored en route in the network. 
        </t>

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: Naive approaches to minimizing message size through
            general-purpose compression algorithms do not produce minimal encodings. 
            Data models can, and should, be designed for compact encoding from
            the beginning. Design strategies for compact encodings involve 
            using structured data, hierarchical data models, and common 
            substructures within data models. These strategies allow for 
            compressibility beyond what would otherwise be achieved by 
            computing large hash values over generalized data structures.

          Identification schemes that would be relative to a specific DA or

            then the number of bytes through a specific named interface
            ("int_foo") would be retrieved in the following way:

              <li>
                  Find the name that matches "int_foo", and infer the agent's index of "int_foo" from the ordered interface list. In
                  this instance, assume that "int_foo" is the fourth interface in the list.
              </li>
              <li> 
                  Query the agent (again) to now return the number of bytes passed through the fourth interface.

          <t>
            Ignoring the inefficiency of two round-trip exchanges, this

          <t>
            The desired data being queried, "number of bytes through 'int_foo'",

          These definitions may represent custom data definitions that are
          applicable only for a particular device or network. Custom

             NOTE: A DM could, for example, define a custom data report that
             includes only summary information about a specific operational
             event or as part of specific debugging. DAs could then produce
             this smaller report until it is no longer necessary, at which 
             point the custom report could be removed from the management

          Custom data elements should be calculated and used both as

          local data fusion, and defining new reporting templates allows
          for DMs to specify desired formats and generally save on link

            The management of applications by a DA should be achievable using

            DA autonomy may be used for simple automation of predefined tasks

            Important features provided by the DA are listed below. These

              for configurations remain difficult in a challenged network, but this approach removes the requirement that a DM be in the loop during regular operations. 
              Preconfiguring stimuli and responses on a DA during periods of

              a standard way at DAs and DMs to provide these functions if the

           the device's standalone operation comes from the preconfiguration
           of its local autonomy engine. This engine-based behavior allows
           the system to behave in a deterministic way, and any new configurations

      <name>Current Remote Management Approaches</name>
      <t>
        Several remote management solutions have been developed for both local area networks and wide area networks. Their capabilities range from simple configuration and report generation to complex modeling of device settings, state, and behavior.
        All of these approaches are successful in the domains for which they have been built but are not all equally functional when deployed in a challenged network.
      </t>
      <t>
        This section describes some of the well-known protocols for remote management and contrasts their purposes with the desirable properties of the DTNMA.
        The purpose of this comparison is to identify parts of existing approaches that can be adopted or adapted for use in challenged networks and where new capabilities should be created specifically for such environments. 
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>SNMP and SMI Models</name>
        <t>
An early and widely used example of a remote management protocol is SNMP, which is currently at version 3 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.
SNMP utilizes a request-response model to get and set data values within an arbitrarily deep object hierarchy.
Objects are used to identify data such as host identifiers, link utilization metrics, error rates, and counters between application software on managing and managed devices <xref target="RFC3411"/>.
Additionally, SNMP supports a model for unidirectional push messages, called event notifications, based on agent-defined triggering events.  
        </t>
        <t>
SNMP relies on logical sessions with predictable round-trip latency to support its pull mechanism, but a single activity is likely to require many round-trip exchanges.
Complex management can be achieved, but only through careful orchestration of real-time, end-to-end, managing-device-generated query-and-response logic.
        </t>
        <t>
          There is existing work that uses the SNMP data model to support 
          some low-fidelity agent-side processing; this work includes using
"<xref target="RFC2982" format="title"/>" <xref target="RFC2982" format="default"/> and
"<xref target="RFC3165" format="title"/>" <xref target="RFC3165" format="default"/>.
          However, agent autonomy is not an SNMP 
          mechanism, so support for a local agent response to an initiating 
          event is limited. In a challenged network where the delay between 
          a managing device receiving an alert and sending a response can be 
          significant, SNMP is insufficient for autonomous event handling.

        <section anchor="sec-mgmt-snmp-smi">
          <name>The SMI Modeling Language</name>
          <t>
SNMP separates the representations for managed data models from messaging, sequencing, and encoding between managers and agents.
Each data model is termed a "Management Information Base" (or "MIB") <xref target="RFC3418"/> and uses the Structure of Management Information (SMI) modeling language <xref target="RFC2578"/>.
Additionally, the SMI itself is based on the ASN.1 syntax <xref target="ASN.1"/>, which is used not just for SMI but for other, unrelated data structure specifications such as the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/>.
Separating data models from messaging and encoding is a best practice in remote management protocols and is also necessary for the DTNMA.
          </t>
          <t>
Each SNMP MIB is composed of managed object definitions, each of which is associated with a hierarchical Object Identifier (OID).
Because of the arbitrarily deep nature of MIB object trees, the size of OIDs is not strictly bounded by the protocol (though it may be bounded by implementations).

SNMPv2 <xref target="RFC3416"/> <xref target="RFC3417"/> and SNMPv3 <xref target="RFC3414"/> can operate over a variety of transports, including plaintext UDP/IP <xref target="RFC3417"/>, SSH/TCP/IP <xref target="RFC5592"/>, and DTLS/UDP/IP or TLS/TCP/IP <xref target="RFC6353"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
SNMP uses an abstracted security model to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.
There are options for the User-based Security Model (USM) <xref target="RFC3414"/>, which uses in-message security, and the Transport Security Model (TSM) <xref target="RFC5591"/>, which relies on the transport to provide security functions and interfaces.

        <name>XML-Infoset-Based Protocols and YANG Data Models</name>

        <t>
Several network management protocols, including NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>, RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>, and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Management Interface (CORECONF) <xref target="CORE-COMI"/>, share the same XML Information Set <xref target="xml-infoset"/> for the information set's hierarchical managed information and XPath expressions <xref target="XPath"/> to identify nodes of that information model.
Since they share the same information model and the same data manipulation operations, together they will be referred to as "*CONF" protocols.
Each protocol, however, provides a different encoding of that information set and its related operation-specific data.
        </t>
        <t>
The YANG modeling language as defined in <xref target="RFC7950"/> is used to define the data model for these management protocols.
Currently, YANG represents the IETF standard for defining managed information models.
        </t> 
        <section>
          <name>The YANG Modeling Language</name>
          <t>
The YANG modeling language defines a syntax and modular semantics for organizing and accessing a device's configuration or operational information.
YANG allows subdividing a full managed configuration into separate namespaces defined by separate YANG modules.
Once a module is developed, it is used (directly or indirectly) on both the client and server to serve as a contract between the two.
A YANG module can be complex, describing a deeply nested and interrelated set of data nodes, actions, and notifications.
          </t>
          <t>
Unlike the separation between ASN.1 syntax and module semantics from higher-level SMI data model semantics as discussed in <xref target="sec-mgmt-snmp-smi"/>, YANG defines both a text syntax and module semantics together with data model semantics.
          </t>
          <t>
The YANG modeling language provides flexibility in the organization of model objects to the model developer.
YANG supports a broad range of data types as noted in <xref target="RFC6991"/>.
YANG also supports the definition of parameterized Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) and actions to be executed on managed devices as well as the definition of event notifications within the model.
          </t>
          <t>
Current *CONF notification logic allows a client to subscribe to the delivery of specific containers or data nodes defined in the model, on either a periodic or
"on-change" basis <xref target="RFC8641"/>.
These notification events can be filtered according to XPath or subtree filtering <xref target="XPath"/> <xref target="RFC6241"/> as described in <xref section="2.2" target="RFC8639"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
The use of YANG for data modeling necessarily comes with some side effects, some of which are described here.
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Text Naming:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>
Data nodes, RPCs, and notifications within a YANG data model are named by a namespace-qualified, text-based path of the module, submodule, container, and any data nodes such as lists, leaf-lists, or leaves, without any explicit hierarchical organization based on data or object type.
              </t>
              <t>
Existing efforts to make compressed names for YANG objects, such as the YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (SIDs) as discussed in <xref section="3.2" target="RFC9254"/>, allow a node to be named by a globally unique integer value but are still relatively verbose (up to 8 bytes per item) and still must be translated into text form for things like instance identification (see below).
Additionally, when representing a tree of named instances, the child elements can use differential encoding of SID integer values as "delta" integers.
The mechanisms for assigning SIDs and the lifecycle of those SIDs are discussed in <xref target="RFC9595"/>.
              </t>
            </dd>
            <dt>Text Values and Built-In Types:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>
Because the original use of YANG with NETCONF was to model XML Information Sets, the values and built-in types are necessarily text based.
JSON encoding of YANG data <xref target="RFC7951"/> allows for optimized representations of many built-in types; similarly, Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) encoding <xref target="RFC9254"/> allows for different optimized representations.
              </t>
              <t>
In particular, the YANG built-in types support a fixed range of decimal fractions (<xref section="9.3" target="RFC7950"/>) but purposefully do not support floating-point numbers.
There are alternatives, such as the type <tt>bandwidth-ieee-float32</tt> <xref target="RFC8294"/> or using the "binary" type with one of the IEEE-754 encodings.
              </t>
            </dd>
            <dt>Deep Hierarchy:</dt>
            <dd>
YANG allows for, and current YANG modules take advantage of, the ability to deeply nest a model hierarchy to represent complex combinations and compositions of data nodes.
When a model uses a deep hierarchy of nodes, this necessarily means that the qualified paths to name those nodes and instances are longer than they would be in a flat namespace.
            </dd>
            <dt>Instance Identification:</dt>
            <dd>
The node instances in a YANG module necessarily use XPath expressions for identification.
Some identification is constrained to be strictly within the YANG domain, such as "must", "when", "augment", or "deviation" statements.
Other identification needs to be processed by a managed device -- for example, via
the "instance-identifier" built-in type.
This means that any implementation of a managed device must include XPath processing and related information model handling per <xref section="6.4" target="RFC7950"/> and its referenced documents.
            </dd>
            <dt>Protocol Coupling:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>
A significant amount of existing YANG tooling or modeling presumes the use of YANG data within a management protocol with specific operations available.
For example, the access control model defined in <xref target="RFC8341"/> relies on those operations specific to the *CONF protocols for proper behavior.
              </t>
              <t>
The emergence of multiple NETCONF-derived protocols may make these presumptions less problematic in the future.
Work to more consistently identify different types of YANG modules and their use has been undertaken to disambiguate how YANG modules should be treated <xref target="RFC8199"/>.
              </t>
            </dd>
            <dt>Manager-Side Control:</dt>
            <dd>
YANG RPCs and actions execute on a managed device and generate an expected, structured response.
RPC execution is strictly limited to those issued by the manager.
Commands are executed immediately and sequentially as they are received by the managed device, and there is no method to autonomously execute RPCs triggered by specific events or conditions.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
The YANG modeling language continues to evolve as new features are needed by adopting management protocols.

            <name>NETCONF Protocol and Transport</name>
            <t>
NETCONF is a stateful, XML-encoding-based protocol that provides a syntax to retrieve, edit, copy, or delete any data nodes or exposed functionality on a server.
It requires that underlying transport protocols support long-lived, reliable, low-latency, sequenced data delivery sessions.
A bidirectional NETCONF session needs to be established before any data transfer (or notification) can occur.
            </t>
            <t>
The XML exchanged within NETCONF messages is structured according to YANG modules supported by the NETCONF agent, and the data nodes reside within one of possibly many datastores in accordance with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
NETCONF transports are required to provide authentication, data integrity, confidentiality, and replay protection.
Currently, NETCONF can operate over SSH/TCP/IP <xref target="RFC6242"/> or TLS/TCP/IP <xref target="RFC7589"/>.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section>
            <name>RESTCONF Protocol and Transport</name>
            <t>
RESTCONF is a stateless, JSON-encoding-based protocol that provides the same operations as NETCONF, using the same YANG modules for structure and the same NMDA datastores, but using RESTful exchanges over HTTP.
It uses HTTP methods to express its allowed operations: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE data nodes within a datastore.
            </t>
            <t>
Although RESTCONF is a logically stateless protocol, it does rely on state within its transport protocol to achieve behaviors such as authentication and security sessions.
Because RESTCONF uses the same data node semantics as NETCONF, a typical activity can involve the use of several sequential round trips of exchanges to first discover managed device state and then act upon it.
            </t>

              CORECONF is an emerging stateless protocol built atop CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/> that
              defines a messaging construct developed to operate specifically 
              on constrained devices and networks by limiting message size and 
              fragmentation. CoAP also implements a request-response system and
              methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

        <t>
Another emerging, but not IETF-affiliated, management protocol is the gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI) <xref target="gNMI"/>, which is based on gRPC messaging and uses Google protobuf data modeling.
        </t>
        <t>
The same limitations as those listed above for RESTCONF apply to gNMI because of its reliance on synchronous HTTP exchanges and TLS for normal operations, as well as the likely deep nesting of data schemas. &nbsp;gNMI is capable of transporting JSON-encoded YANG-modeled data, but how to compose such data is not yet fully standardized.
        </t>
        <section>
          <name>The Protobuf Modeling Language</name>
          <t>
The data managed and exchanged via gNMI is encoded and modeled using Google protobuf, an encoding and modeling syntax not affiliated with the IETF (although an attempt has been made and abandoned <xref target="PROTOCOL-BUFFERS"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
Because the protobuf modeling syntax is a relatively low-level syntax (about the same as ASN.1 or CBOR), there are some efforts as part of the OpenConfig work <xref target="gNMI"/> to translate YANG modules into protobuf schemas (similar to translation to XML or JSON schemas for NETCONF and RESTCONF, respectively), but there is no required interoperability between management via gRPC or any of the *CONF protocols.

        </section>
        <section>
          <name>gRPC Protocol and Transport</name>
          <t>
The message encoding and exchange for gNMI, as the name implies, is the gRPC protocol <xref target="gRPC"/>. &nbsp;gRPC exclusively uses HTTP/2 <xref target="RFC9113"/> for transport and relies on some aspects specific to HTTP/2 for its operations (such as HTTP trailer fields).
While not mandated by gRPC, when used to transport gNMI data, TLS is required for transport security.

        <t>
A lower-level remote management protocol, intended to be used to manage hardware devices and network appliances below the operating system (OS), is the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI), standardized in <xref target="IPMI"/>.
The IPMI is focused on health monitoring, event logging, firmware management, and Serial over LAN (SOL) remote console access in a "pre-OS or OS-absent" host environment.
The IPMI operates over a companion Remote Management Control Protocol (RMCP) for messaging, which itself can use UDP for transport.
        </t>
        <t>
Because the IPMI and RCMP are tailored to low-level and well-connected devices within a data center, with typical workflows requiring many messaging round trips or low-latency interactive sessions, they are not suitable for operation over a challenged network.

        <name>Autonomic Networking</name>

          The future of network operations requires more autonomous behavior,
          including self-configuration, self-management, self-healing, and 
          self-optimization. One approach to support this is termed "Autonomic 
          Networking" <xref target="RFC7575"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          There is a large and growing set of work within the IETF 
          focused on developing an Autonomic Networking Integrated Model and 
          Approach (ANIMA). The ANIMA work has developed a comprehensive 
          reference model for distributing autonomic functions across multiple 
          nodes in an Autonomic Networking infrastructure <xref target="RFC8993"/>. 
        </t>
        <t>
          This work, focused on learning the behavior of distributed systems to
          predict future events, is an emerging network management
          capability. This includes the development of signaling protocols
          such as the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) <xref target="RFC8990"/> and the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)
          <xref target="RFC8368"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Both autonomic and challenged networks require similar degrees of
          autonomy. However, challenged networks cannot provide the complex 
          coordination between nodes and distributed supporting infrastructure 
          necessary for the frequent data exchanges for negotiation, learning, 
          and bootstrapping associated with the above capabilities.          
        </t>
        <t>
          There is some emerging work in ANIMA as to how disconnected
          devices might join and leave the ACP over time.
          However, this work is addressing a different problem
          than that encountered by challenged networks.

        <name>Deep Space Autonomy</name>

Outside of the terrestrial networking community, there are existing and established remote management systems used for deep space mission operations.
Two examples of such systems are the New Horizons mission to Pluto <xref target="NEW-HORIZONS"/> and the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission to the asteroid Dimorphos <xref target="DART"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
The DTNMA has some heritage in the concepts of deep space autonomy, but each of those mission instantiations uses mission-specific data encoding, messaging, and transport as well as mission-specific (or heavily mission-tailored) modeling concepts and languages.
Part of the goal of the DTNMA is to take the proven concepts from these missions and standardize a messaging syntax as well as a modular data modeling method.

      <t>
        Management mechanisms that provide the complete set of DTNMA desirable 
        properties do not currently exist. This is not surprising, since 
        autonomous management in the context of a challenged networking 
        environment is a new and emerging use case. 
      </t>

      <t>
        In particular, a management architecture is needed that integrates 
        the following motivating features. 
      </t>

      <dl>
        <dt>Open-Loop Control:</dt>
        <dd>
          Freedom from a request-response architecture, 
          API, or other presumption of timely round-trip communications. This 
          is particularly important when managing networks that are not built
          over an HTTP or TCP/TLS infrastructure. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Standard Autonomy Model:</dt>
        <dd>
          An autonomy model that allows for standard
          expressions of policy to guarantee deterministic behavior across 
          devices and vendor implementations.
        </dd>
        <dt>Compressible Model Structure:</dt>
        <dd>
          A data model that allows for very 
          compact encodings by defining and exploiting common structures for 
          data schemas. 
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <t>
        Combining these new features with existing mechanisms for message data
        exchange (such as BP), data representations (such as CBOR), and data 
        modeling languages (such as YANG) will form a pragmatic approach to 
        defining challenged network management.

          This section describes a reference model for analyzing
          network management concepts for challenged networks (generally) and 
          those conforming to the DTN architecture (in particular). The goal 
          of this section is to describe how DTNMA services provide DTNMA 
          desirable properties.

        <name>Important Concepts</name>
     
        <t>
          Like other network management architectures, the DTNMA draws
          a logical distinction between a managed device and a managing
          device. Managed devices use a DA to manage resident applications. 
          Managing devices use a DM to both monitor and control DAs. 
        </t>

          <t>
            The terms "managing" and "managed" represent logical
            characteristics of a device and are not, themselves, mutually
            exclusive. For example, a managed device might, itself, also manage
            some other device in the network. Therefore, a device may support 
            either or both of these characteristics.
         </t>

        <t>
          The DTNMA differs from some other management architectures in 
          three significant ways, all related to the need for a device to 
          self-manage when disconnected from a managing device.
        </t>

        <dl>
          <dt>Pre-Shared Definitions:</dt>
          <dd>
            Managing and managed devices should operate
            using pre-shared data definitions and models. This implies that
            static definitions should be standardized whenever possible and
            that managing and managed devices may need to negotiate definitions
            during periods of connectivity.
          </dd>
          <dt>Agent Self-Management:</dt>
          <dd>
            A managed device may find itself 
            disconnected from its managing device. In many challenged networking 
            scenarios, a managed device may spend the majority of its time without 
            a regular connection to a managing device. In these cases, DAs manage 
            themselves by applying pre-shared policies received from managing 
            devices.
          </dd>
          <dt>Command-Based Interface:</dt>
          <dd>
            Managing devices communicate with managed
            devices through a command-based interface.  Instead of exchanging
            variables, objects, or documents, a managing device issues commands
            to be run by a managed device. These commands may create or update
            variables, change datastores, or impact the managed device in ways
            similar to other network management approaches. The use of commands
            is, in part, driven by the need for DAs to receive updates from 
            both remote management devices and local autonomy. The use of Controls for the implementation of commands is discussed in more detail in <xref target="ctrl_exec"/>.

        A DTNMA reference model is provided in <xref target="dtnma_ref_model"/> 
        below. In this reference model, applications and services on a managing 
        device communicate with a DM that uses pre-shared definitions to create 
        a set of policy directives that can be sent to a managed device's DA via
        a command-based interface. The DA provides local monitoring and control 
        (commanding) of the applications and services resident on the managed 
        device. The DA also performs local data fusion as necessary to synthesize data products (such as 
        reports) that can be sent back to the DM when appropriate.

      <t>
        This model preserves the familiar concept of "managers" resident on
        managing devices and "agents" resident on managed devices. However,
        the DTNMA model is unique in how the DM and DA operate. The DM is
        used to preconfigure DAs in the network with management policies.
        It is expected that the DAs, themselves, perform monitoring and
        control functions on their own. In this way, a properly configured
        DA may operate without a reliable connection back to a DM.

          The reference model illustrated in <xref target="dtnma_ref_model"/>
          implies the existence of certain logical components whose roles and

          <t>
            By definition, managed applications and services reside on a 
            managed device. These software entities can be controlled through
            some interface by the DA, and their state can be sampled as part of
            periodic monitoring. It is presumed that the DA on the managed
            device has the proper data model, control interface, and 
            permissions to alter the configuration and behavior of these
            software applications.

        </section>

        <section numbered="true">
          <name>DTNMA Agent (DA)</name>

          <t>
            A DA resides on a managed device. As is the case 
            with other network management approaches, this agent is responsible
            for the monitoring and control of the applications local to that
            device. Unlike other network management approaches, the agent 
            accomplishes this task without a regular connection to a DM.
          </t>

          <t>
            The DA performs three major functions on a managed 
            device: the monitoring and control of local applications, 
            production of data analytics, and the administrative 
            control of the agent itself.

            <name>Monitoring and Control</name>

            <t>
              DAs monitor the status of applications running on their
              managed device and selectively control those applications as a
              function of that monitoring. The following components are used to 
              perform monitoring and control on an agent.

              <dt>Rule Database:</dt>
              <dd>
                Each DA maintains a database of policy expressions that form
                rules regarding the behavior of the managed device. Within this database,
                each rule regarding behavior is a tuple of a stimulus and a response.
                Within the DTNMA, these rules are the embodiment of
                policy expressions received from DMs and evaluated at
                regular intervals by the autonomy engine. The rule database is
                the collection of active rules known to the DA.

              <dd>              
                The DA autonomy engine monitors the state of the managed device,
                looking for predefined stimuli and, when such stimuli are encountered, issuing a
                predefined response. To the extent that this function is driven
                by the rule database, this engine acts as a policy execution
                engine. This engine may also be directly configured by
                managers during periods of connectivity for actions separate
                from those in the rule database (such as enabling or disabling
                sets of rules). Once configured, the engine may function 
                without other access to any managing device. This engine may 
                also reconfigure itself as a function of policy.

                the configuration and behavior of an application. These 
                interfaces may be custom for each application or as provided

                These data generators may be configured with descriptions of 
                data values, and the data values they generate may be included

                  The DTNMA allows for a many-to-many relationship amongst DAs
                  and DMs. A single DM may configure multiple
                  DAs, and a single DA may be configured by multiple
                  DMs. Multiple managers may exist in a network for at least
                  the following two reasons. First, different managers may exist to control
                  different applications on a device. Second, multiple managers
                  increase the likelihood of an agent encountering a manager when

 While multiple managers are needed for proper operation in

 different managers can result.
                  Implementations of the DTNMA should consider conflict resolution
                  mechanisms. Such mechanisms might include analyzing managed content, 
                  time, agent location, or other relevant information to select

                Additionally, there might not be a one-to-one mapping between commands

                  applications. These control interfaces are used to receive
                  desired policy statements from applications. These interfaces
                  may be custom for each application or as provided through

                  DAs implement a standardized autonomy model

                  the open-loop control structures provided by managing 
                  applications to be represented in a common language. Policy 
                  encoders perform this encoding function.

                  of agents and the creation of messages that support 
                  store-and-forward operations. It is recommended that control 
                  messages be packaged using BP bundles when there may be 
                  intermittent connectivity between DMs and DAs.

                  The DTNMA allows DMs to communicate with multiple

              A consequence of operating in a challenged environment is the
              potential inability to negotiate information in real time. For 
              this reason, the DTNMA requires that managed and managing devices

        This section describes the services provided by DTNMA
        components on both managing and managed devices. Most
        of the services discussed in this section attempt to provide
        continuous operation of a managed device through periods of 
        no connectivity with a managing device.

        <name>Local Monitoring and Control</name>
        <t> 
          DTNMA monitoring is associated with some DA autonomy engine. The 
          term "monitoring" implies regular access to information such that 
          state changes may be acted upon within some response time period.
        </t>

        <t>
          Predicate autonomy on a managed device should collect state 
          associated with the device at regular intervals and evaluate that
          collected state for any changes that require a preventative or 
          corrective action. Similarly, this monitoring may cause the device
          to generate one or more reports destined to a managing device.
        </t>

        <t>
          Like monitoring, DTNMA control results in actions by the
          agent to change the state or behavior of the managed
          device. All control in the DTNMA is local control. In cases where 
          there exists a timely connection to a DM, received Controls 
          are still evaluated and run locally as part of local autonomy. In 
          this case, the autonomy stimulus is the receipt of the Control, and 
          the response is to immediately run the Control. In this way, there 
          is never a dependency on a session or other stateful exchange with 
          any remote entity.

        <name>Local Data Fusion</name>
        <t> 
          DTNMA fusion services produce new data products from existing 
          state on the managed device. These fusion products can be anything
          from simple summations of sampled counters to complex calculations 
          of behavior over time. 
        </t>
        <t>
          Fusion is an important service in the DTNMA because fusion 
          products are part of the overall state of a managed device. 
          Complete knowledge of this overall state is important for the 
          management of the device, and the predicates of rules on a DA may 
          refer to fused data.
        </t>

        <t>
          In situ data fusion is an important function, as it allows
          for the construction of intermediate summary data, the reduction
          of stored and transmitted raw data, and possibly fewer predicates in rule
          definitions; this type of data fusion insulates the data source from 
          conclusions drawn from that data. 
        </t>
        <t>
          The DTNMA requires fusion to occur on the managed device itself. If 
          the network is partitioned such that no connection to a managing 
          device is available, then fusion needs to happen locally. Similarly, 
          connections to a managing device might not remain active long enough 
          for round-trip data exchange or may not have the bandwidth to send 
          all sampled data. 
        </t>

          <aside>
            <t>
              NOTE: The DTNMA does not restrict the storage and transmission 
              of raw (pre-fused) data. Such raw data can be useful for 
              debugging managed devices, understanding complex interactions 
              and underlying conditions, and tuning for better performance 
              and/or better outcomes.

          DTNMA configuration services update the local configuration 
          of a managed device with the intent of impacting the behavior and
          capabilities of that device.
        </t>

        <t>
          The DTNMA configuration service is unique in that the selection of
          managed device configurations occurs as a function of
          the state of the device. This implies that management proxies on
          the device store multiple configuration functions that can be 
          applied as needed without consultation from a managing device.
        </t>

          <t>
            This approach differs from other management concepts of selecting 
            from multiple datastores. DTNMA configuration functions
            can target individual data elements and can calculate new values
            from local device state.
          </t>

        <t>
          When detecting stimuli, the agent autonomy engine supports
          a mechanism for evaluating whether application monitoring data
          or runtime data values are recent enough to indicate a change of
          state. In cases where data has not been updated recently, it may
          be considered stale and therefore not used to reliably indicate that some
          stimulus has occurred.

        <name>Remote Reporting</name>
        <t> 
          DTNMA reporting services collect information known to the managed
          device and prepare it for eventual transmission to one or more
          managing devices. The contents of these reports, and the frequency at
          which they are generated, occur as a function of the state of the 
          managed device, independent of the managing device.
        </t>

        <t>
          Once generated, it is expected that reports might be queued, pending
          a connection back to a managing device. Therefore, reports need to be
          differentiable as a function of the time they were generated.
        </t>

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: When reports are queued pending transmission, the overall 
            storage capacity at the queuing device needs to be considered. 
            There may be cases where queued reports can be considered expired
            because they have been either queued for too long or
            replaced by a newer report. When a report is 
            considered expired, it may be considered for removal and, thus,
            never transmitted. This consideration is expected to be part of
            the implementation of the queuing device and not the responsibility of the reporting function within the DTNMA. 
          </t>
        </aside>

        
        <t>
          When reports are sent to a managing device over a challenged 
          network, they may arrive out of order due to taking different paths
          through the network or being delayed due to retransmissions. A
          managing device should not infer meaning from the order in which 
          reports are received.
        </t>
        <t> 
          Reports may or may not be associated with a specific Control. Some
          reports may be annotated with the Control that caused the report to
          be generated. Sometimes, a single report will represent the end
          state of applying multiple Controls.

        <t>
          Authorization services enforce the potentially complex mapping of
          other DTNMA services amongst managed and managing devices in the

            A managing autonomy capability on a potentially disconnected 
            device needs to behave in both an expressive and deterministic way.
            Expressivity
            allows for the model to be configured for a wide range of future
            situations. Determinism allows for the forensic reconstruction of
            device behavior as part of debugging or recovery efforts. It
            also is necessary to ensure predictable behavior.
          </t>

          <aside>
            <t>
              NOTE: The use of predicate logic and a stimulus-response
              system does not conflict with the use of higher-level 
              autonomous functions or the incorporation of Machine Learning (ML). 
              Specifically, the DTNMA deterministic autonomy model can
              coexist with other autonomous functions managing applications
              and network services.
            </t>
            <t>
              An example of such coexistence is the use of the DTNMA model
              to ensure that a device stays within safe operating parameters while
              a less deterministic ML model directs other
              behaviors for the device.

          <t>
            The DTNMA autonomy model is a rule-based model in which individual 
            rules associate a pre-identified stimulus 
            with a preconfigured response to that stimulus. 
          </t>

          <t>
            Stimuli are identified using one or more predicate logic expressions
            that examine aspects of the state of the managed device. Responses 
            are implemented by running one or more procedures on the managed 
            device.
          </t>

          <t>
            In its simplest form, a stimulus is a single predicate expression
            of a condition that examines some aspect of the state of the 
            managed device. When the condition is met, a predetermined response is
            applied. This behavior can be captured using the construct:
          </t>

          <sourcecode name="" type="pseudocode"><![CDATA[            IF <condition 1> THEN <response 1>
]]></sourcecode>

          <t>
            In more complex forms, a stimulus may include both a common condition 
            shared by multiple rules and a specific condition for each individual rule.
            If the common condition is not met, the evaluation of the specific 
            condition of each rule sharing the common condition can be skipped. In
            this way, the total number of predicate evaluations can be reduced.

              NOTE: The DTNMA model remains a stimulus-response system, regardless
              of whether a common condition is part of the stimulus. However,
              it is recommended that implementations incorporate a common
              condition because of the efficiency provided by such a bulk
              evaluation.

              NOTE: One use of a stimulus "common condition" is to associate the

              the changing of a monitored value.

              The DTNMA does not prescribe when to evaluate rule stimuli.
              Implementations may choose to evaluate rule stimuli at periodic
              intervals (such as 1 Hz or 100 Hz). When stimuli include onboard 
              events, implementations may choose to perform an immediate
              evaluation at the time of the event rather than waiting for a
              periodic evaluation.

            In the model shown in <xref target="dtnma_aut_model"/>,
            the autonomy engine stores the combination of stimulus 
            conditions and associated responses as a set of "rules" in a
            rule database. This database is updated through the execution of
            the autonomy engine and as configured from policy statements
            received by DMs.
          </t>
          <t>
            Stimuli are detected by examining the state of applications as
            reported through application monitoring interfaces and through
            any locally derived data. Local data is calculated in accordance
            with definitions also provided by DMs as part of the runtime
            datastore. 
          </t>
          <t>
            Responses to stimuli may include updates to the rule database,
            updates to the runtime datastore, Controls sent to applications,
            and the generation of reports.

          <name>Model Characteristics</name>

          <t>
            There are several practical challenges to the implementation of a
            distributed rule-based system.  Large numbers of rules may be 
            difficult to understand, deconflict, and debug. Rules whose 
            conditions are given by fused or other dynamic data may require
            data logging and reporting for deterministic offline analysis. Rule differences
            across managed devices may lead to oscillating effects. This section 
            identifies those characteristics of an autonomy model that might 
            help implementations mitigate some of these challenges. 
          </t>

          <t>
            There are a number of ways to represent data values, and many
            data modeling languages exist for this purpose. When 
            considering how to model data in the context of the DTNMA
            autonomy model, there are some modeling features that should be
            present to enable functionality. There are also some modeling
            features that should be prevented to avoid ambiguity.
          </t>
          <t>
            Conventional network management approaches favor flexibility in 
            their data models. The DTNMA stresses deterministic behavior
            that supports forensic analysis of agent activities "after the
            fact". As such, the following statements should be true of all
            data representations relating to DTNMA autonomy. 
          </t>

          <dl>
            <dt>Strong Typing:</dt>
            <dd>
              The predicates and expressions that comprise
              the autonomy services in the DTNMA should require strict data
              typing. This avoids errors associated with implicit data
              conversions and helps detect misconfigurations. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Acyclic Dependency:</dt>
            <dd>
              Many dependencies exist in an autonomy model, 
              particularly when combining individual expressions or
              results to create complex behaviors. Implementations that
              conform to the DTNMA need to prevent circular dependencies. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Fresh Data:</dt>
            <dd>
              Autonomy models operating on data values 
              presume that their data inputs represent the actionable state
              of the managed device. If a data value has failed to be 
              refreshed within a time period, autonomy might incorrectly
              infer an operational state. Regardless of whether a data
              value has changed, DTNMA implementations should provide some
              indicator of whether the data value is "fresh", i.e., meaning that
              it still represents the current state of the device.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pervasive Parameterization:</dt>
            <dd>
              Where possible, autonomy
              model objects should support parameterization to allow for
              flexibility in the specification. Parameterization allows for
              the definition of fewer unique model objects and also can
              support the substitution of local device state when 
              exercising device control or data reporting.
            </dd>
            <dt>Configurable Cardinality:</dt>
            <dd>
              The number of data values that can
              be supported in a given implementation is finite. For devices
              operating in challenged environments, the number of supported 
              objects may be far fewer than the number of objects that can be supported by
              devices in well-resourced environments. DTNMA implementations
              should define limits to the number of supported objects that
              can be active in a system at one time, as a function of the
              resources available to the implementation.
            </dd>
            <dt>Control-Based Updates:</dt>
            <dd>
              The agent autonomy engine changes the
              state of the managed device by running Controls on the device.
              This is different from approaches where the behavior of
              a managed device is influenced by updating configuration
              values, such as in a table or datastore. Altering behavior via
              one or more Controls allows checking all preconditions before
              making changes as well as providing more granularity in the
              way in which the device is updated. Where necessary, Controls
              can be defined to perform bulk updates of configuration data
              so as not to lose that update modality. One important
              update precondition is that the system is not  
              performing an action that would prevent the update (such as 
              currently applying a competing update).

          <name>Data Value Representation</name>
          <t>
            The expressive representation of simple data values is fundamental to 
            the successful construction and evaluation of predicates in the
            DTNMA autonomy model. When defining such values, there are
            useful distinctions regarding how values are identified
            and whether values are generated in a way that is internal or external to the 
            autonomy model.
          </t>

          <t>
            A DTNMA data value should combine a base type
            (e.g., integer, real, string) representation with relevant semantic
            information. Base types are used for proper storage and encoding. 
            Semantic information allows for additional typing, constraint definitions, 
            and mnemonic naming. This expanded
            definition of data values allows for better predicate construction,
            better evaluation, and early type checking.
          </t>

          <t>
            Data values may further be annotated based on whether their value
            is the result of a DA calculation or the result of some external 
            process on the managed device. For example, operators may wish to
            know which values can be updated by actions on the DA versus which
            values (such as sensor readings) cannot be reliably changed because
            they are calculated in a way that is external to the DA.

      <section numbered="true">
        <name>Data Reporting</name>
        <t>
          The DTNMA autonomy model should, as required, report on the
          state of its managed device (to include the state of the
          model itself). This reporting should be done as a function of
          the changing state of the managed device, independent of the
          connection to any managing device. Queuing reports allows for
          later forensic analysis of device behavior; this feature is a 
          desirable property of DTNMA management. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
          DTNMA data reporting consists of the production of some
          data report instance conforming to a data report schema. The use
          of schemas allows a report instance to identify the schema to which
          it conforms instead of carrying the structure in the report itself. 
          This approach can significantly reduce the size of generated reports.
        </t>

          <t>
            The DTNMA data reporting concept is intentionally distinct 
            from the concept of exchanging datastores across a network. It is
            envisioned that a DA might generate a data report instance of a
            data report schema at regular intervals or in response to local
            events. In this model, many report schemas may be defined to capture
            unique, relevant combinations of known data values rather than
            sending bulk datastores off-platform for analysis.
          </t>

        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: It is not required that data report schemas be tabular in
            nature. Individual implementations might define tabular
            schemas for table-like data and other report schemas for more 
            heterogeneous reporting.

      <section numbered="true" anchor="ctrl_exec">
        <name>Command Execution</name>
        <t>
          The agent autonomy engine requires that managed devices issue 
          commands on themselves as if they were otherwise being controlled 
          by a managing device. The DTNMA implements commanding through the
          use of Controls and macros. 
        </t>

        <t>
          Controls represent parameterized, predefined procedures run by the DA
          either as directed by the DM or as part of a rule response from the
          DA autonomy engine. Macros represent ordered sequences of Controls.
        </t>

        <t>
          Controls are conceptually similar to RPCs in 
          that they represent parameterized functions run on the managed 
          device. However, they are conceptually dissimilar to RPCs in that 
          they do not have a concept of a return code because they operate 
          over an asynchronous transport. The concept of a return code in an RPC 
          implies a synchronous relationship between the caller of the 
          procedure and the procedure being called, which might not be 
          possible within the DTNMA. 
        </t>

        <t>
          The success or failure of a Control may be handled locally by the 
          agent autonomy engine. Local error handling is particularly important
          in this architecture, given the potential for long periods of
          disconnectivity between a DA and a DM. The failure
          of one or more Controls is part of the state of the DA and can be used to trigger rules within the DA autonomy engine.
        </t>

        <t>
          The impact of a Control is externally observable via the generation 
          and eventual examination of data reports produced by the managed device.
        </t>

        <t>
          The failure of certain Controls might leave a managed device in an 
          undesirable state. Therefore, it is important
          that there be consideration for Control-specific recovery
          mechanisms (such as a rollback or safing mechanism). When a 
          Control that is part of a macro (such as in an autonomy response)
          fails, there may be a need to implement a safe state for the
          managed device based on the nature of the failure. 
        </t>


        <aside>
          <t>
            NOTE: The use of the term "Control" in the DTNMA is derived in 
            part from the concept of Command and Control (C2), where control 
            implies the operational instructions undertaken to
            implement (or maintain) a commanded objective. The DA
            autonomy engine implements controls on a managed device to allow it to fulfill some commanded objective known by a (possibly disconnected) managing device.
          </t>

          <t>
            For example, a device might be commanded to maintain a safe internal thermal environment. Actions taken by a DA to manage heaters, louvers, and other temperature-affecting components are controls taken in service of that commanded objective.

        <t>
          As discussed in <xref target="aut_mod_overview"/>, the DTNMA
          rule-based stimulus-response system associates stimulus detection with a
          predetermined response. Rules may be categorized based on whether
          (1)&nbsp;their
          stimuli include generic statements of managed device state or
          (2)&nbsp;they
          are optimized to only consider the passage of time on the device.
        </t>

        <t>
          State-based rules are those whose stimulus is based on the evaluated
          state of the managed device. Time-based rules are a unique subset of
          state-based rules whose stimulus is given only by a time-based event.
          Implementations might create different structures and evaluation
          mechanisms for these two different types of rules to achieve more

        <t>
          In this figure, DM A sends a policy statement in the form of a 
          rule to DAs A and B, which instructs the DAs to produce a report 
          for EDD1 every second (step 1). Each DA receives this policy, which is 
          stored in its respective rule database, and configures its autonomy engine. 
          Reports are transmitted by each DA when produced (step 2).
        </t>
        <t>
          At a later time, DM A sends an additional policy to
          DA B, requesting the production of a report for EDD2 every second 
          (step 3). This policy is added to DA B's rule database.
        </t>
        <t>
          Following this policy update, DA A will continue to produce EDD1,
          and DA B will produce both EDD1 and EDD2 (step 4). However,
          DA B may provide these values to the DM in a single report rather than as 
          two independent reports. In this way, there is no direct mapping between the 
          consolidated reports sent by DA B (from step 4 onwards) and the two 
          different policies sent to DA B (steps 1 and 3) that produce the information included in those consolidated reports.

        <t>
          The managed applications on a DA may be controlled by different
          administrative entities in a network. The DTNMA allows DAs to
          communicate with multiple DMs in the network, such as in cases
          where there is one DM per administrative domain. 
        </t>
        <t>
          Whenever a DM sends a policy expression to a DA, that policy 
          expression may be associated with authorization information. One 
          method of representing this is an ACL. 
        </t>

          <t>
            The use of an ACL in this use case does not imply that the DTNMA 
            requires ACLs to annotate policy expressions. ACLs and their 
            representation in this context are for example purposes only.

          The ability of one DM to access the results of policy

            In this figure, both DM A and DM B send policies to 
            DA A (step 1). DM A defines a variable (V1) whose value is given 
            by the mathematical expression (EDD1 * 2) and is associated with an 
            ACL (ACL1) that restricts access to V1 to DM A only. Similarly, DM B 
            defines a variable (V2) whose value is given by the mathematical 
            expression (EDD2 * 2) and is associated with an ACL (ACL2) that restricts 
            access to V2 to DM B only.

            Both DM A and DM B also send policies to DA A to

            Since DM A can access V1 and DM B can access V2, there is 
            no authorization issue with these policies, and they are both
            accepted by the autonomy engine on DA A. DA A produces
            reports as expected, sending them to their respective managers 
            (step 3).

          <t>
            Later (step 4), DM B attempts to configure DA A to also
            report to it the value of V1. Since DM B does not have
            authorization to view this variable, DA A does not include this
            in the configuration of its autonomy engine; instead, some
            indication of a permission error is included in any regular
            reporting back to DM B.
          </t>
          <t>
            DM A also sends a policy to DA A (step 5) that defines a 
            variable (V3) whose value is given by the mathematical expression 
            (EDD3 * 3) and is not associated with an ACL, indicating that any 
            DM can access V3. In this instance, both DM A and DM B can
            then send policies to DA A to report the value of V3 (step 6).
            Since there is no authorization restriction on V3, these policies
            are accepted by the autonomy engine on DA A, and reports are
            sent to both DM A and DM B over time (step 7).

          There are times when a single network device may serve as both
          a DM for other DAs in the network and, itself, as a 
          device managed by someone else. This may be the case on nodes
          serving as gateways or proxies. The DTNMA accommodates this case by 
          allowing a single device to run both a DA and a DM.

          An example of this configuration is illustrated in

          A device can operate as both a DM and a DA.
        </t>
        <t>
          In this example, we presume that DA B is able to sample a
          given EDD (EDD1) and that DA C is able to sample a different
          EDD (EDD2). Node B houses DM B (which controls DA C) and DA B 
          (which is controlled by DM A). DM A must periodically receive 
          some new value that is calculated as a function of both EDD1 
          and EDD2. 
        </t>

        <t>
          First, DM A sends a policy to DA B to define a variable (V0) whose value 
          is given by the mathematical expression (EDD1 + EDD2) without a 
          restricting ACL. Further, DM A sends a policy to DA B to report on 
          the value of V0 every second (step 1).
        </t>

        <t>
          DA B needs the ability to monitor both EDD1 and EDD2 to produce V0.
          DA B is able to sample EDD1, so DM B sends a policy to DA B to report on
          the value of EDD1.
          However, the only way to receive EDD2 values is to have them 
          reported back to Node B by DA C and included in the Node B 
          runtime datastores. Therefore, DM B also sends a policy to DA C to
          report on the value of EDD2 (step 2).
        </t>
        <t>
          DA B receives the policy in its autonomy engine and produces
          reports on the value of EDD2 every second.  Similarly, DA C
          receives the policy in its autonomy engine and produces reports on the
          value of EDD2 every second (step 3).
        </t>
        <t>
          DA B may locally sample EDD1 and EDD2 and uses that to compute
          values of V0 and report on those values at regular intervals to DM A 
          (step 4).
        </t>
        <t>            
          While a trivial example, the mechanism of associating fusion with 
          the DA function rather than the DM function scales with 
          fusion complexity. Within the DTNMA, DAs and DMs are not required to 
          be separate software implementations. There may be a single software 
          application running on Node B implementing both DM B and DA B roles.

   <section anchor="Security"  numbered="true">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>        
        Security within a DTNMA exists in at least the following two layers: security
        in the data model and security in the messaging and encoding of the
        data model. 
      </t>

      <t>
        Data model security refers to the validity and accessibility of data 
        elements. For example, a data element might be available to certain DAs or DMs in a system, whereas the same data element may be hidden from other DAs or DMs. Both verification and authorization mechanisms
        at DAs and DMs are important to achieve this type of security. 
      </t>

      <aside>
        <t>
          NOTE: One way to provide finer-grained application security is 
          through the use of ACLs that would be defined 
          as part of the configuration of DAs and DMs. It is expected that 
          many common data model tools provide mechanisms for the definition 
          of ACLs and best practices for their operational use.
        </t>
      </aside>

      <t>
         The exchange of information between and amongst DAs and DMs in the 
         DTNMA is expected to be accomplished through some secured messaging 
         transport.
