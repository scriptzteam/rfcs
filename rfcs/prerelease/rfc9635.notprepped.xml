    <abstract>
      <t>The Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP) defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a piece of
      software and conveying the results and artifacts of that delegation to
      the software. This delegation can include access to a set of APIs as
      well as subject information passed directly to the software.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>GNAP allows a piece of software, the client instance, to request delegated
authorization to resource servers and subject information. The delegated access to
the resource server can be used by the client instance to access resources and APIs
on behalf a resource owner, and delegated access to
subject information can in turn be used by the client instance to make authentication decisions.
This delegation is facilitated by an authorization server, usually on
behalf of a resource owner. The end user operating the software can interact
with the authorization server to authenticate, provide consent, and
authorize the request as a resource owner.</t>
      <t>The process by which the delegation happens is known as a grant, and
GNAP allows for the negotiation of the grant process
over time by multiple parties acting in distinct roles.</t>

<t>This specification focuses on the portions of the delegation process facing the client instance.
In particular, this specification defines interoperable methods for a client instance to request, negotiate,
and receive access to information facilitated by the authorization server.
This specification additionally defines methods for the client instance to access
protected resources at a resource server.
This specification also discusses discovery mechanisms that enable the client instance to
configure itself dynamically.
The means for an authorization server and resource server to interoperate are
discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-gnap-resource-servers"/>.</t>
      <t>The focus of this protocol is to provide interoperability between the different
parties acting in each role, not to specify implementation details of each.
Where appropriate, GNAP may make recommendations about internal implementation
details, but these recommendations are to ensure the security of the overall
deployment rather than to be prescriptive in the implementation.</t>
      <t>This protocol solves many of the same use cases as OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/>,
OpenID Connect <xref target="OIDC"/>, and the family of protocols that have grown up
around that ecosystem. However, GNAP is not an extension of OAuth 2.0
and is not intended to be directly compatible with OAuth 2.0. GNAP seeks to
provide functionality and solve use cases that OAuth 2.0 cannot easily
or cleanly address. <xref target="vs-oauth2"/> further details the protocol rationale compared to OAuth 2.0.
GNAP and OAuth 2.0 will likely exist in parallel
for many deployments, and considerations have been taken to facilitate
the mapping and transition from existing OAuth 2.0 systems to GNAP. Some examples
of these can be found in <xref target="example-oauth2"/>.</t>

    shown here.

<t>This document contains non-normative examples of partial and complete HTTP messages, JSON structures, URIs, query components, keys, and other elements. Whenever possible, the document uses URI as a generic term, since it aligns with the recommendations in <xref target="RFC3986"/> and better matches the intent that the identifier may be reachable through various/generic means (compared to URLs). Some examples use a single trailing backslash (<tt>\</tt>) to indicate line wrapping for long values, as per <xref target="RFC8792"/>. The <tt>\</tt> character and leading spaces on wrapped lines are not part of the value.</t>
        <t>This document uses the term "mutual TLS" as defined by <xref target="RFC8705"/>. The shortened form "MTLS" is used to mean the same thing.</t>
        <t>For brevity, the term "signature" on its own is used in this document to refer to both digital signatures (which use asymmetric cryptography) and keyed Message Authentication Codes (MACs) (which use symmetric cryptography). Similarly, the verb "sign" refers to the generation of either a digital signature or a keyed MAC over a given signature base. The qualified term "digital signature" refers specifically to the output of an asymmetric cryptographic signing operation.</t>

        <t>The design of GNAP does not assume any one deployment architecture
but instead attempts to define roles that can be fulfilled in a number
of different ways for different use cases. As long as a given role fulfills
all of its obligations and behaviors as defined by the protocol, GNAP does
not make additional requirements on its structure or setup.</t>
        <t>Multiple roles can be fulfilled by the same party, and a given party
can switch roles in different instances of the protocol. For example, in many instances,
the RO and end user are the same person, where a user
authorizes the client instance to act on their own behalf at the RS. In this case,
one party fulfills the roles of both RO and end user, but the roles themselves
are still defined separately from each other to allow for other
use cases where they are fulfilled by different parties.</t>
        <t>As another example,
in some complex scenarios, an RS receiving requests from one client instance can act as
a client instance for a downstream secondary RS in order to fulfill the
original request. In this case, one piece of software is both an
RS and a client instance from different perspectives, and it fulfills these
roles separately as far as the overall protocol is concerned.</t>
        <t>A single role need not be deployed as a monolithic service. For example,
a client instance could have frontend components that are installed on the end user's device as
well as a backend system that the frontend communicates with. If both of these
components participate in the delegation protocol, they are both considered
part of the client instance. If there are several copies of the client software
that run separately but all share the same key material, such as a
deployed cluster, then this cluster is considered a single client instance.
In these cases, the distinct components of what is considered a GNAP client instance
may use any number of different communication mechanisms between them, all of which
would be considered an implementation detail of the client instances and out of scope of GNAP.</t>
        <t>As another example, an AS could likewise be built out of many constituent
components in a distributed architecture. The component that the client instance
calls directly could be different from the component that the
RO interacts with to drive consent, since API calls and user interaction
have different security considerations in many environments. Furthermore,
the AS could need to collect identity claims about the RO from one system
that deals with user attributes while generating access tokens at
another system that deals with security rights. From the perspective of
GNAP, all of these are pieces of the AS and together fulfill the
role of the AS as defined by the protocol. These pieces may have their own internal
communications mechanisms, which are considered out of scope of GNAP.</t>

        <name>Trust Relationships</name>

        <t>GNAP defines its trust objective as follows: the RO trusts the AS to ensure access validation and delegation of protected resources to end users, through third party clients.</t>
	<t>This trust objective can be decomposed into trust relationships between software elements and roles, especially the pairs end user/RO, end user/client, client/AS, RS/RO, AS/RO, and AS/RS. Trust of an agent by its pair can exist if the pair is informed that the agent has made a promise to follow the protocol in the past (e.g., pre-registration and uncompromised cryptographic components) or if the pair is able to infer by indirect means that the agent has made such a promise (e.g., a compliant client request). Each agent defines its own valuation function of promises given or received. Examples of such valuations can be the benefits from interacting with other agents (e.g., safety in client access and interoperability with identity standards), the cost of following the protocol (including its security and privacy requirements and recommendations), a ranking of promise importance (e.g., a policy decision made by the AS), the assessment of one's vulnerability or risk of not being able to defend against threats, etc. Those valuations may depend on the context of the request. For instance, depending on the specific case in which GNAP is used, the AS may decide to either take into account or discard hints provided by the client, or the RS may refuse bearer tokens. Some promises can be affected by previous interactions (e.g., repeated requests).</t>

        <t>Below are details of each trust relationship:</t>

        <dl spacing="normal">
          <dt>end user/RO:</dt><dd>This relationship exists only when the end user and the RO are different, in which case the end user needs some out-of-band mechanism of getting the RO consent (see <xref target="authorization"/>). GNAP generally assumes that humans can be authenticated, thanks to identity protocols (for instance, through an id_token assertion as described in <xref target="request-subject"/>).</dd>
          <dt>end user/client:</dt><dd>The client acts as a user agent. Depending on the technology used (browser, single-page application (SPA), mobile application, Internet of Things (IoT) device, etc.), some interactions may or may not be possible (as described in <xref target="request-interact-start"/>). Client developers implement requirements and generally some recommendations or best practices, so that the end users may confidently use their software. However, end users might also face an attacker's client software or a poorly implemented client without even realizing it.</dd>
          <dt>end user/AS:</dt><dd>When the client supports the interaction feature (see <xref target="response-interact"/>), the end user interacts with the AS through an AS-provided interface. In many cases, this happens through a front-channel interaction through the end user's browser. See <xref target="security-front-channel"/> for some considerations in trusting these interactions.</dd>
          <dt>client/AS:</dt><dd>An honest AS may face an attacker's client (as discussed just above), or the reverse, and GNAP aims to make common attacks impractical. This specification makes access tokens opaque to the client and defines the request/response scheme in detail, therefore avoiding extra trust hypotheses from this critical piece of software. Yet, the AS may further define cryptographic attestations or optional rules to simplify the access of clients it already trusts, due to past behavior or organizational policies (see <xref target="request-client"/>).</dd>
	  <dt>RS/RO:</dt><dd>On behalf of the RO, the RS promises to protect its resources from unauthorized access and only accepts valid access tokens issued by a trusted AS. In case tokens are key bound, proper validation of the proofing method is expected from the RS.</dd>
          <dt>AS/RO:</dt><dd>The AS is expected to follow the decisions made by the RO, through either interactive consent requests, repeated interactions, or automated rules (as described in <xref target="sequence"/>). Privacy considerations aim to reduce the risk of an honest but too-curious AS or the consequences of an unexpected user data exposure.</dd>
          <dt>AS/RS:</dt><dd>The AS promises to issue valid access tokens to legitimate client requests (i.e., after carrying out appropriate due diligence, as defined in the GNAP). Some optional configurations are covered by <xref target="I-D.ietf-gnap-resource-servers"/>.</dd>
</dl>

        <t>A global assumption made by GNAP is that authorization requests are security and privacy sensitive, and appropriate measures are detailed in Sections <xref target="security" format="counter"/> and <xref target="privacy" format="counter" />, respectively.</t>

	
        <t>A formal trust model is out of scope of this specification, but one could be developed using techniques such as the Promise Theory <xref target="promise-theory"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="protocol">
        <name>Protocol Flow</name>
        <t>GNAP is fundamentally designed to allow delegated access to APIs and other information, such as subject information, using a multi-stage, stateful process. This process allows different parties to provide information into the system to alter and augment the state of the delegated access and its artifacts.</t>
        <t>The underlying requested grant moves through several states as different actions take place during the protocol, as shown in <xref target="state-diagram"/>.</t>

        <t>The state of the grant request is defined and managed by the AS, though the client instance also needs to manage its view of the grant request over time. The means by which these roles manage their state are outside the scope of this specification.</t>

          <dd>When a request for access (<xref target="request"> </xref>) is received by the AS, a new grant request is created and placed in the <em>processing</em> state by the AS. This state is also entered when an existing grant request is updated by the client instance and when interaction is completed. In this state, the AS processes the context of the grant request to determine whether interaction with the end user or RO is required for approval of the request. The grant request has to exit this state before a response can be returned to the client instance. If approval is required, the request moves to the <em>pending</em> state, and the AS returns a continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) along with any appropriate interaction responses (<xref target="response-interact"> </xref>). If no such approval is required, such as when the client instance is acting on its own behalf or the AS can determine that access has been fulfilled, the request moves to the <em>approved</em> state where access tokens for API access (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) and subject information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>) can be issued to the client instance. If the AS determines that no additional processing can occur (such as a timeout or an unrecoverable error), the grant request is moved to the <em>finalized</em> state and is terminated.</dd>
          <dt><em>Pending</em>:</dt>
          <dd>When a request needs to be approved by an RO, or interaction with the end user is required, the grant request enters a state of <em>pending</em>. In this state, no access tokens can be granted, and no subject information can be released to the client instance. While a grant request is in this state, the AS seeks to gather the required consent and authorization (<xref target="authorization"> </xref>) for the requested access. A grant request in this state is always associated with a continuation access token bound to the client instance's key (see <xref target="response-continue"/> for details of the continuation access token). If no interaction finish method (<xref target="request-interact-finish"> </xref>) is associated with this request, the client instance can send a polling continuation request (<xref target="continue-poll"> </xref>) to the AS. This returns a continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) while the grant request remains in this state, allowing the client instance to continue to check the state of the pending grant request. If an interaction finish method (<xref target="request-interact-finish"> </xref>) is specified in the grant request, the client instance can continue the request after interaction (<xref target="continue-after-interaction"> </xref>) to the AS to move this request to the <em>processing</em> state to be re-evaluated by the AS. Note that this occurs whether the grant request has been approved or denied by the RO, since the AS needs to take into account the full context of the request before determining the next step for the grant request. When other information is made available in the context of the grant request, such as through the asynchronous actions of the RO, the AS moves this request to the <em>processing</em> state to be re-evaluated. If the AS determines that no additional interaction can occur, e.g., all the interaction methods have timed out or a revocation request (<xref target="continue-delete"> </xref>) is received from the client instance, the grant request can be moved to the <em>finalized</em> state.</dd>
          <dt><em>Approved</em>:</dt>
          <dd>When a request has been approved by an RO and no further interaction with the end user is required, the grant request enters a state of <em>approved</em>. In this state, responses to the client instance can include access tokens for API access (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) and subject information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>). If continuation and updates are allowed for this grant request, the AS can include the continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>). In this state, post-interaction continuation requests (<xref target="continue-after-interaction"> </xref>) are not allowed and will result in an error, since all interaction is assumed to have been completed. If the client instance sends a polling continuation request (<xref target="continue-poll"> </xref>) while the request is in this state, new access tokens (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) can be issued in the response. Note that this always creates a new access token, but any existing access tokens could be rotated and revoked using the token management API (<xref target="token-management"> </xref>). The client instance can send an update continuation request (<xref target="continue-modify"> </xref>) to modify the requested access, causing the AS to move the request back to the <em>processing</em> state for re-evaluation. If the AS determines that no additional tokens can be issued and that no additional updates are to be accepted (e.g., the continuation access tokens have expired), the grant is moved to the <em>finalized</em> state.</dd>
          <dt><em>Finalized</em>:</dt>
          <dd>After the access tokens are issued, if the AS does not allow any additional updates on the grant request, the grant request enters the <em>finalized</em> state. This state is also entered when an existing grant request is revoked by the client instance (<xref target="continue-delete"> </xref>) or otherwise revoked by the AS (such as through out-of-band action by the RO). This state can also be entered if the AS determines that no additional processing is possible, for example, if the RO has denied the requested access or if interaction is required but no compatible interaction methods are available. Once in this state, no new access tokens can be issued, no subject information can be returned, and no interactions can take place. Once in this state, the grant request is dead and cannot be revived. If future access is desired by the client instance, a new grant request can be created, unrelated to this grant request.</dd>

        <t>While it is possible to deploy an AS in a stateless environment, GNAP is a stateful protocol, and such deployments will need a way to manage the current state of the grant request in a secure and deterministic fashion without relying on other components, such as the client software, to keep track of the current state.</t>

        <name>Sequences</name>
        <t>GNAP can be used in a variety of ways to allow the core
delegation process to take place. Many portions of this process are
conditionally present depending on the context of the deployments,
and not every step in this overview will happen in all circumstances.</t>
        <t>Note that a connection between roles in this process does not necessarily
indicate that a specific protocol message is sent across the wire
between the components fulfilling the roles in question or that a
particular step is required every time. For example, for a client instance interested
in only getting subject information directly and not calling an RS,
all steps involving the RS below do not apply.</t>
        <t>In some circumstances,
the information needed at a given stage is communicated out of band
or is pre-configured between the components or entities performing
the roles. For example, one entity can fulfill multiple roles, so
explicit communication between the roles is not necessary within the
protocol flow. Additionally, some components may not be involved
in all use cases. For example, a client instance could be calling the
AS just to get direct user information and have no need to get
an access token to call an RS.</t>

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>(A) The end user interacts with the client instance to indicate a need for resources on
  behalf of the RO. This could identify the RS that the client instance needs to call,
  the resources needed, or the RO that is needed to approve the
  request. Note that the RO and end user are often
  the same entity in practice, but GNAP makes no general assumption that they are.
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(1) The client instance determines what access is needed and which AS to approach for access. Note that
  for most situations, the client instance is pre-configured with which AS to talk to and which
  kinds of access it needs, but some more dynamic processes are discussed in
  <xref target="rs-request-without-token"/>.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(2) The client instance requests access at the AS (<xref target="request"> </xref>).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(3) The AS processes the request and determines what is needed to fulfill
  the request (see <xref target="authorization"/>).
  The AS sends its response to the client instance (<xref target="response"> </xref>).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(B) If interaction is required, the
  AS interacts with the RO (<xref target="authorization"> </xref>) to gather authorization.
  The interactive component of the AS can function
  using a variety of possible mechanisms, including web page
  redirects, applications, challenge/response protocols, or
  other methods. The RO approves the request for the client instance
  being operated by the end user. Note that the RO and end user are often
  the same entity in practice, and many of GNAP's interaction methods allow
  the client instance to facilitate the end user interacting with the AS
  in order to fulfill the role of the RO.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(4) The client instance continues the grant at the AS (<xref target="continue-request"> </xref>). This action could
  occur in response to receiving a signal that interaction has finished (<xref target="interaction-finish"> </xref>) or
  through a periodic polling mechanism, depending on the interaction capabilities of the client
  software and the options active in the grant request.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(5) If the AS determines that access can be granted, it returns a
  response to the client instance (<xref target="response"> </xref>), including an access token (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) for
  calling the RS and any directly returned information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>) about the RO.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(6) The client instance uses the access token (<xref target="use-access-token"> </xref>) to call the RS.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(7) The RS determines if the token is sufficient for the request by
  examining the token. The means of the RS determining this access are
  out of scope of this specification, but some options are discussed in
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-gnap-resource-servers"/>.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(8) The client instance calls the RS (<xref target="use-access-token"> </xref>) using the access token
  until the RS or client instance determines that the token is no longer valid.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(9) When the token no longer works, the client instance
  rotates the access token (<xref target="rotate-access-token"> </xref>).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(10) The AS issues a new access token (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) to the client instance
  with the same rights as the original access token returned in (5).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(11) The client instance uses the new access token (<xref target="use-access-token"> </xref>) to call the RS.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(12) The RS determines if the new token is sufficient for the request, as in (7).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(13) The client instance disposes of the token (<xref target="revoke-access-token"> </xref>) once the client instance
  has completed its access of the RS and no longer needs the token.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>The following sections and <xref target="examples"/> contain specific guidance on how to use
GNAP in different situations and deployments. For example, it is possible for the
client instance to never request an access token and never call an RS, just as it is
possible to have no end user involved in the delegation process.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sequence-redirect">
          <name>Redirect-Based Interaction</name>
          <t>In this example flow, the client instance is a web application that wants access to resources on behalf
of the current user, who acts as both the end user and the RO. Since the client instance is capable of directing the user to an arbitrary URI and
receiving responses from the user's browser, interaction here is handled through
front-channel redirects using the user's browser. The redirection URI used for interaction is
a service hosted by the AS in this example. The client instance uses a persistent session
with the user to ensure the same user that is starting the interaction is the user
that returns from the interaction.</t>

              <t>(1) The client instance establishes a session with the user, in the role of the end user.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(2) The client instance requests access to the resource (<xref target="request"> </xref>). The client instance indicates that
 it can redirect to an arbitrary URI (<xref target="request-interact-redirect"> </xref>) and
 receive a redirect from the browser (<xref target="request-interact-callback-redirect"> </xref>). The client instance
 stores verification information for its redirect in the session created
 in (1).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(3) The AS determines that interaction is needed and responds (<xref target="response"> </xref>) with
 a URI to send the user to (<xref target="response-interact-redirect"> </xref>) and
 information needed to verify the redirect (<xref target="response-interact-finish"> </xref>) in (7).
 The AS also includes information the client instance will need to
 continue the request (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) in (8). The AS associates this
 continuation information with an ongoing request that will be referenced in (4), (6), and (8).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(4) The client instance stores the verification and continuation information from (3) in the session from (1). The client instance
 then redirects the user to the URI (<xref target="interaction-redirect"> </xref>) given by the AS in (3).
 The user's browser loads the interaction redirect URI. The AS loads the pending
 request based on the incoming URI generated in (3).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(5) The user authenticates at the AS, taking on the role of the RO.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(6) As the RO, the user authorizes the pending request from the client instance.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(7) When the AS is done interacting with the user, the AS
 redirects the user back (<xref target="interaction-callback"> </xref>) to the
 client instance using the redirect URI provided in (2). The redirect URI is augmented with
 an interaction reference that the AS associates with the ongoing
 request created in (2) and referenced in (4). The redirect URI is also
 augmented with a hash of the security information provided
 in (2) and (3). The client instance loads the verification information from (2) and (3) from
 the session created in (1). The client instance calculates a hash (<xref target="interaction-hash"> </xref>)
 based on this information and continues only if the hash validates.
 Note that the client instance needs to ensure that the parameters for the incoming
 request match those that it is expecting from the session created
 in (1). The client instance also needs to be prepared for the end user never being returned
 to the client instance and handle timeouts appropriately.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(8) The client instance loads the continuation information from (3) and sends the
 interaction reference from (7) in a request to
 continue the request (<xref target="continue-after-interaction"> </xref>). The AS
 validates the interaction reference, ensuring that the reference
 is associated with the request being continued.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(9) If the request has been authorized, the AS grants access to the information
 in the form of access tokens (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) and
 direct subject information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>) to the client instance.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(10) The client instance uses the access token (<xref target="use-access-token"> </xref>) to call the RS.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(11) The RS validates the access token and returns an appropriate response for the
API.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <t>In this example flow, the client instance is a device that is capable of presenting a short,
human-readable code to the user and directing the user to enter that code at
a known URI. The user enters the code at a URI that is an interactive service hosted by the
AS in this example. The client instance is not capable of presenting an arbitrary URI to the user,
nor is it capable of accepting incoming HTTP requests from the user's browser.
The client instance polls the AS while it is waiting for the RO to authorize the request.
The user's interaction is assumed to occur on a secondary device. In this example,
it is assumed that the user is both the end user and RO. Note that since the user is not assumed
to be interacting with the client instance through the same web browser used for interaction at
the AS, the user is not shown as being connected to the client instance in this diagram.</t>

          <ul spacing="normal"><li>
              <t>(1) The client instance requests access to the resource (<xref target="request"> </xref>). The client instance indicates that
 it can display a user code (<xref target="request-interact-usercode"> </xref>).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(2) The AS determines that interaction is needed and responds (<xref target="response"> </xref>) with
 a user code to communicate to the user (<xref target="response-interact-usercode"> </xref>).
 The AS also includes information the client instance will need to
 continue the request (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) in (8) and (10). The AS associates this
 continuation information with an ongoing request that will be referenced in (4), (6), (8), and (10).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(3) The client instance stores the continuation information from (2) for use in (8) and (10). The client instance
 then communicates the code to the user (<xref target="interaction-usercode"> </xref>) given by the AS in (2).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(4) The user directs their browser to the user code URI. This URI is stable and
 can be communicated via the client software's documentation, the AS documentation, or
 the client software itself. Since it is assumed that the RO will interact
 with the AS through a secondary device, the client instance does not provide a mechanism to
 launch the RO's browser at this URI.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(5) The end user authenticates at the AS, taking on the role of the RO.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(6) The RO enters the code communicated in (3) to the AS. The AS validates this code
against a current request in process.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(7) As the RO, the user authorizes the pending request from the client instance.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(8) When the AS is done interacting with the user, the AS
 indicates to the RO that the request has been completed.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(9) Meanwhile, the client instance loads the continuation information stored at (3) and
 continues the request (<xref target="continue-request"> </xref>). The AS determines which
 ongoing access request is referenced here and checks its state.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(10) If the access request has not yet been authorized by the RO in (6),
the AS responds to the client instance to continue the request (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>)
at a future time through additional polled continuation requests. This response can include
updated continuation information as well as information regarding how long the
client instance should wait before calling again. The client instance replaces its stored
continuation information from the previous response (2).
Note that the AS may need to determine that the RO has not approved
the request in a sufficient amount of time and return an appropriate
error to the client instance.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(11) The client instance continues to poll the AS (<xref target="continue-poll"> </xref>) with the new
continuation information in (9).</t>
            </li>
            <li>

          <t>In this example flow, the end user and RO roles are fulfilled by different parties, and
the RO does not interact with the client instance. The AS reaches out asynchronously to the RO
during the request process to gather the RO's authorization for the client instance's request.
The client instance polls the AS while it is waiting for the RO to authorize the request.</t>

	    <t>(1) The client instance requests access to the resource (<xref target="request"> </xref>). The client instance does not
 send any interaction modes to the server, indicating that
 it does not expect to interact with the RO. The client instance can also signal
 which RO it requires authorization from, if known, by using the
 subject request field (<xref target="request-subject"> </xref>) and
 user request field (<xref target="request-user"> </xref>). It's also possible for the AS to determine which
 RO needs to be contacted by the nature of what access is being requested.</t>

 with the RO. The AS responds (<xref target="response"> </xref>) with the information the client instance
 will need to continue the request (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) in (6) and (8), including
 a signal that the client instance should wait before checking the status of the request again.
 The AS associates this continuation information with an ongoing request that will be
 referenced in (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8).</t>

 subject request (<xref target="request-subject"> </xref>), the
 access request (<xref target="request-token"> </xref>), and other policy information. The AS

 an error message, since no error has yet occurred. This response can include
 refreshed credentials as well as information regarding how long the
 client instance should wait before calling again. The client instance replaces its stored
 continuation information from the previous response (2).
 Note that the AS may need to determine that the RO has not approved
 the request in a sufficient amount of time and return an appropriate
 error to the client instance.</t>

            <li>
              <t>(9) If the request has been authorized, the AS grants access to the information

 direct subject information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>) to the client instance.</t>

 a new version of the access token and can also include updated token management

          <t>In this scenario, the client instance does not call an RS and does not
request an access token. Instead, the client instance only requests
and is returned direct subject information (<xref target="response-subject"></xref>). Many different
interaction modes can be used in this scenario, so these are shown only in
the abstract as functions of the AS here.</t>

              <t>(8) If the request has been authorized, the AS grants access to the requested
 direct subject information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>) to the client instance.
 At this stage, the user is generally considered "logged in" to the client
 instance based on the identifiers and assertions provided by the AS.
 Note that the AS can restrict the subject information returned, and it
 might not match what the client instance requested; see <xref target="response-subject"/> for details.</t>

          <name>Cross-User Authentication</name>
          <t>In this scenario, the end user and RO are two different people.
Here, the client instance already knows who the end user
is, likely through a separate authentication process. The
end user, operating the client instance, needs to get subject information
about another person in the system, the RO. The RO is given an opportunity
to release this information using an asynchronous interaction method
with the AS. This scenario would apply, for instance, when the end user
is an agent in a call center and the RO is a customer
authorizing the call-center agent to access their account on their behalf.</t>

          <t>Precondition: The end user is authenticated to the client instance, and the client
instance has an identifier representing the end user that it can present to the AS.
This identifier should be unique to the particular session with the client instance
and the AS.
The client instance is also known to the AS and allowed to access this
advanced functionality where the information of someone other than
the end user is returned to the client instance.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal"><li>
              <t>(1) The RO communicates a human-readable
identifier to the end user, such as an email address or account number. This communication
happens out of band from the protocol, such as over the phone between parties. Note that the
RO is not interacting with the client instance.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(2) The end user communicates the identifier to the client instance. The means by which the
 identifier is communicated to the client instance are out of scope for this specification.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(3) The client instance requests access to subject information (<xref target="request"> </xref>).
 The request includes the RO's identifier in the
 <tt>sub_ids</tt> field of the subject information request 
	      (<xref target="request-subject"> </xref>) 
 and the end user's identifier in the <tt>user</tt> field (<xref target="request-user"> </xref>).
 The request includes no interaction start methods, since the end user is not expected to
 be the one interacting with the AS. The request does include the
 push-based interaction finish method (<xref target="request-interact-callback-push"> </xref>) to allow the AS
 to signal to the client instance when the interaction with the RO has concluded.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(4) The AS sees that the identifiers for the end user and subject being requested are different.
 The AS determines that it can reach out to the RO asynchronously for approval. While it
 is doing so, the AS returns a continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) with a <tt>finish</tt> nonce
 to allow the client instance to continue the grant request after interaction with the RO has concluded.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(5) The AS contacts the RO and has them authenticate to the system. The means for doing this are
 outside the scope of this specification, but the identity of the RO is known from the Subject
 Identifier sent in (3).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(6) The RO is prompted to authorize the end user's request via the client instance. Since the end
 user was identified in (3) via the <tt>user</tt> field, the AS can show this information to the
 RO during the authorization request.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(7) The RO completes the authorization with the AS. The AS marks the request as <em>approved</em>.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(8) The RO pushes the interaction finish message (<xref target="interaction-pushback"> </xref>) to the client instance.
 Note that in the case the RO cannot be reached or the RO denies the request, the AS still sends the interaction
 finish message to the client instance, after which the client instance can negotiate next steps if possible.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(9) The client instance validates the interaction finish message and
 continues the grant request (<xref target="continue-after-interaction"> </xref>).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(10) The AS returns the RO's subject information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>) to the client instance.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>(11) The client instance can display or otherwise utilize the RO's user information in its session
with the end user. Note that since the client instance requested different sets of user
information in (3), the client instance does not conflate the end user with the RO.</t>
            </li>

      <t>Sending a request to the grant endpoint creates a grant request in the <em>processing</em> state.

      <t>The request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent as a JSON object in the content of the HTTP
POST request with Content-Type <tt>application/json</tt>. A key proofing mechanism <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
define an alternative content type, as long as the content is formed from
the JSON object. For example, the attached JSON Web Signature (JWS) key proofing mechanism (see <xref target="attached-jws"/>) places the JSON object
into the payload of a JWS wrapper, which is in turn sent as the message content.</t>

        <t>Additional fields can be defined in the "GNAP Client Instance Fields" registry (<xref target="IANA-client-instance"></xref>).</t>
        <t>Absent additional attestations, profiles, or trust mechanisms, both the <tt>display</tt> and <tt>class_id</tt> fields are self-declarative, presented by the client instance. The AS needs to exercise caution in their interpretation, taking them as a hint but not as absolute truth. The <tt>class_id</tt> field can be used in a variety of ways to help the AS make sense of the particular context in which the client instance is operating. In corporate environments, for example, different levels of trust might apply depending on security policies. This field aims to help the AS adjust its own access decisions for different classes of client software. It is possible to configure a set of values and rules during a pre-registration and then have the client instances provide them later in runtime as a hint to the AS. In other cases, the client runs with a specific AS in mind, so a single hardcoded value would be acceptable (for instance, a set-top box with a <tt>class_id</tt> claiming to be "FooBarTV version 4"). While the client instance may not have contacted the AS yet, the value of this <tt>class_id</tt> field can be evaluated by the AS according to a broader context of dynamic use, alongside other related information available elsewhere (for instance, corresponding fields in a certificate). If the AS is not able to interpret or validate the class_id field, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> either return an <tt>invalid_client</tt> error (<xref target="response-error"/>) or interpret the request as if the class_id were not present. See additional discussion of client instance impersonation in <xref target="security-impersonation"/>.</t>
        <t>The client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> prove possession of any presented key by the proofing mechanism
associated with the key in the request. Key proofing methods
are defined in the "GNAP Key Proofing Methods" registry (<xref target="IANA-key-proof-methods"></xref>), and an initial set of methods
is described in <xref target="binding-keys"/>.</t>
        <t>If the same public key is sent by value on different access requests, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
treat these requests as coming from the same client instance for purposes
of identification, authentication, and policy application.</t>
        <t>If the AS does not know the client instance's public key ahead of time, the AS
can choose how to process the unknown key. Common approaches include:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Allowing the request and requiring RO authorization in a trust-on-first-use model</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Limiting the client's requested access to only certain APIs and information</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Denying the request entirely by returning an <tt>invalid_client</tt> error (<xref target="response-error"/>)</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The client instance <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send a symmetric key by value in the <tt>key</tt> field of the request, as doing so would expose
the key directly instead of simply proving possession of it. See considerations on symmetric keys
in <xref target="security-symmetric"/>. To use symmetric keys, the client instance can send the <tt>key</tt> by reference (<xref target="key-reference"/>) or
send the entire client identity by reference (<xref target="request-instance"/>).</t>
        <t>The client instance's key can be pre-registered with the AS ahead of time and associated
with a set of policies and allowable actions pertaining to that client. If this pre-registration
includes other fields that can occur in the <tt>client</tt> request object described in this section,
such as <tt>class_id</tt> or <tt>display</tt>, the pre-registered values <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> take precedence over any values
given at runtime. Additional fields sent during a request but not present in a pre-registered
client instance record at the AS <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be added to the client's pre-registered record.
See additional considerations regarding client instance impersonation in <xref target="security-impersonation"/>.</t>
        <t>A client instance that is capable of talking to multiple ASes <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use a different key for each

          <t>If the presented key is known to the AS and is associated with a single instance
of the client software, the process of presenting a key and proving possession of that key
is sufficient to authenticate the client instance to the AS. The AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> associate policies
with the client instance identified by this key, such as limiting which resources
can be requested and which interaction methods can be used. For example, only
specific client instances with certain known keys might be trusted with access tokens without the
AS interacting directly with the RO, as in <xref target="example-no-user"/>.</t>
          <t>The presentation of a key allows the AS to strongly associate multiple
successive requests from the same client instance with each other. This
is true when the AS knows the key ahead of time and can use the key to
authenticate the client instance, but it is also true if the key is
ephemeral and created just for this series of requests. As such, the
AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> allow for client instances to make requests with unknown keys. This pattern allows
for ephemeral client instances (such as single-page applications) and client software with many individual long-lived instances
(such as mobile applications) to generate key pairs per instance and use the keys within
the protocol without having to go through a separate registration step.
The AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> limit which capabilities are made available to client instances
with unknown keys. For example, the AS could have a policy saying that only
previously registered client instances can request particular resources or that all

such validation are outside the scope of this specification, common validation steps include
verifying the signature of the assertion against a trusted signing key, verifying the audience
and issuer of the assertion map to expected values, and verifying the time window for the
assertion itself. However, note that in many use cases, some of these common steps are relaxed.
For example, an AS acting as an identity provider (IdP) could expect that assertions being presented using this
mechanism were issued by the AS to the client software. The AS would verify that the AS is the
issuer of the assertion, not the audience, and that the client instance is instead the audience of
the assertion. Similarly, an AS might accept a recently expired assertion in order to help
bootstrap a new session with a specific end user.</t>

        <t>Subject Identifiers returned by the AS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> uniquely identify the RO at the
AS. Some forms of Subject Identifiers are opaque to the client instance (such as the subject of an
issuer and subject pair), while other forms (such as email address and phone number) are
intended to allow the client instance to correlate the identifier with other account information
at the client instance. The client instance <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> request or use any returned Subject Identifiers for communication
purposes (see <xref target="request-subject"/>). That is, a Subject Identifier returned in the format of an email address or
a phone number only identifies the RO to the AS and does not indicate that the
AS has validated that the represented email address or phone number in the identifier
is suitable for communication with the current user. To get such information,
the client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use an identity protocol to request and receive additional identity
claims. The details of an identity protocol and associated schema
are outside the scope of this specification.</t>
        <t>The AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that the returned subject information represents the RO. In most cases,
the AS will also ensure that the returned subject information represents the end user authenticated
interactively at the AS.
The AS <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> reuse Subject Identifiers for multiple different ROs.</t>
        <t>The "sub_ids" and "assertions" response fields are independent of each other. That is, a
returned assertion <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use a different Subject Identifier than other assertions and
Subject Identifiers in the response. However, all Subject Identifiers and assertions returned
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> refer to the same party.</t>
        <t>The client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> interpret all subject information in the context of the AS from which the
subject information is received, as is discussed in Section 6 of <xref target="SP80063C"/>. For example, one AS could
return an email identifier of  "user@example.com" for one RO, and a different AS could return that
same email identifier of "user@example.com" for a completely different RO. A client instance talking to
both ASes needs to differentiate between these two accounts by accounting for the AS source
of each identifier and not assuming that either has a canonical claim on the identifier without
additional configuration and trust agreements. Otherwise, a rogue AS could exploit this to
take over a targeted account asserted by a different AS.</t>

      <name>Determining Authorization and Consent</name>
      <t>When the client instance makes its initial request (<xref target="request"> </xref>) to the AS for delegated access, it
is capable of asking for several different kinds of information in response:</t>

<ul spacing="normal">
        <li>

        <li>
          <t>any additional requested information defined by extensions of this protocol</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>When the grant request is in the <em>processing</em> state, the AS determines what authorizations and
consents are required to fulfill this requested delegation. The details of how the
AS makes this determination are out of scope for this document. However, there are several common
patterns defined and supported by GNAP for fulfilling these requirements, including information
sent by the client instance, information gathered through the interaction process, and information
supplied by external parties. An individual AS can define its own policies and processes for
deciding when and how to gather the necessary authorizations and consent and how those are applied
to the grant request.</t>
      <t>To facilitate the AS fulfilling this request, the client instance sends information about the
actions the client software can take, including:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>starting interaction with the end user, in the <tt>interact</tt> request parameter</t>

        <li>
          <t>any additional capabilities defined by extensions of this protocol</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>The client instance can also supply information directly to the AS in its request. The client instance can send several kinds of things, including:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">

      <t>The AS will process this presented information in the context of the client instance's request and

access, the AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> move the grant request to the <em>approved</em> state and return results <xref target="response">immediately in its response</xref> with
access tokens and subject information.</t>
      <t>If the AS determines that additional runtime authorization is required, the AS can either deny the
request outright (if there is no possible recovery) or move the grant request to the <em>pending</em>
state and use a number of means at its disposal to gather that authorization from the appropriate ROs, including:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>starting interaction with the end user facilitated by the client software, such as a redirection or user code</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>challenging the client instance through a challenge-response mechanism</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>requesting that the client instance present specific additional information, such as a user's credential or an assertion</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>contacting an RO through an out-of-band mechanism, such as a push notification</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>executing an auxiliary software process through an out-of-band mechanism, such as querying a digital wallet</t>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <t>The process of gathering authorization and consent in GNAP is left deliberately flexible to allow for a
wide variety of different deployments, interactions, and methodologies.
In this process, the AS can gather consent from the RO or apply the RO's policy as necessitated by the access that has
been requested. The AS can sometimes determine which RO needs to prompt for consent based on what has been requested
by the client instance, such as a specific RS record, an identified subject, or a request requiring specific
access such as approval by an administrator. In other cases, the request is applied to whichever RO is present at the time of consent gathering. This pattern is especially prevalent when the
end user is sent to the AS for an interactive session, during which the end user takes on the role of the RO. In these cases, the end user is delegating their own access as RO to the client instance.</t>
      <t>The client instance can indicate that it is capable of facilitating interaction with the end user,
another party, or another piece of software through its interaction start request (<xref target="request-interact-start"></xref>). Here, the
AS usually needs to interact directly with
the end user to determine their identity, determine their status as an RO, and collect their consent. If the AS has determined
that authorization is required and the AS can support one or more of the requested interaction start
methods, the AS returns the associated interaction start responses (<xref target="response-interact"> </xref>). The client
instance <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> initiate one or more of these interaction methods (<xref target="interaction-start"> </xref>) in order to
facilitate the granting of the request. If more than one interaction start method is available,
the means by which the client chooses which methods to follow are out of scope of this specification.</t>
      <t>After starting interaction, the client instance can then make a continuation request (<xref target="continue-request"> </xref>)
either in response to a signal indicating the finish of the interaction (<xref target="interaction-finish"> </xref>), after a time-based
polling, or through some other method defined by an extension of this specification through the "GNAP Interaction Mode Responses" registry (<xref target="IANA-interaction-response"></xref>).</t>
      <t>If the grant request is not in the <em>approved</em> state, the
client instance can repeat the interaction process by sending a grant update request (<xref target="continue-modify"></xref>) with new interaction methods (<xref target="request-interact"> </xref>).</t>
      <t>The client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use each interaction method once at most if a response can be detected.
The AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> handle any interact request as a one-time-use mechanism and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> apply suitable
timeouts to any interaction start methods provided, including user codes and redirection URIs.
The client instance <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> apply suitable timeouts to any interaction finish method.</t>
      <t>In order to support client software deployed in disadvantaged network conditions, the AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
allow for processing of the same interaction method multiple times if the AS can determine
that the request is from the same party and the results are idempotent.
For example, if a client instance launches a redirect to the AS but does not receive a response
within a reasonable time, the client software can launch the redirect again, assuming that it never
reached the AS in the first place. However, if the AS in question
receives both requests, it could mistakenly process them separately, creating an undefined state for the
client instance. If the AS can determine that both requests come from the same origin or under the same session,
and the requests both came before any additional state change to the grant occurs, the AS can reasonably
conclude that the initial response was not received and the same response can be returned to the client instance.</t>
      <t>If the AS instead has a means of contacting the RO directly, it could
do so without involving the client instance in its consent-gathering process. For example, the AS could
push a notification to a known RO and have the RO approve the pending request asynchronously. These interactions
can be through an interface of the AS itself (such as a hosted web page), through another application (such as
something installed on the RO's device), through a messaging fabric, or any other means.</t>

<t>When interacting with an RO, the AS can use various strategies to determine
the authorization of the requested grant, including:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>authenticate the RO through a local account or some other means, such as federated login</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>validate the RO through presentation of claims, attributes, or other information</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>prompt the RO for consent for the requested delegation</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>describe to the RO what information is being released, to whom, and for what purpose</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>provide warnings to the RO about potential attacks or negative effects of allowing the information</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>allow the RO to modify the client instance's requested access, including limiting or expanding that access</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>provide the RO with artifacts such as receipts to facilitate an audit trail of authorizations</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>allow the RO to deny the requested delegation</t>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <t>The AS is also allowed to request authorization from more than one RO, if the AS deems fit. For example, a medical
record might need to be released by both an attending nurse and a physician, or both owners of a bank account
need to sign off on a transfer request. Alternatively, the AS could require N of M possible ROs
to approve a given request. In some circumstances, the AS could even determine that the end user
present during the interaction is not the appropriate RO
for a given request and reach out to the appropriate RO asynchronously.</t>
<t>The RO is also allowed to define an automated policy at the AS to determine which kind of end user can get access to the resource and under which conditions. For instance, such a condition might require the end user to log in and accept the RO's legal provisions. Alternatively, client software could be acting without an end user, and the RO's policy allows issuance of access tokens to specific instances of that client software without human interaction.</t>

<t>While all of these cases are supported by GNAP, the details of their
implementation and the methods for determining which ROs or related policies
are required for a given request are out of scope for this specification.

        <name>Starting Interaction with the End User</name>
        <t>When a grant request is in the <em>pending</em> state, the interaction start methods sent by
the client instance can be used to facilitate interaction with the end user.
To initiate an interaction start method indicated by the
interaction start responses (<xref target="response-interact"> </xref>) from the AS, the client instance
follows the steps defined by that interaction start mode. The actions of the client instance
required for the interaction start modes defined in this specification are described
in the following subsections. Interaction start modes defined in extensions to this specification
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> define the expected actions of the client software when that interaction start mode is used.</t>
        <t>If the client instance does not start an interaction start mode within an AS-determined amount of
time, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject attempts to use the interaction start modes. If the client instance has
already begun one interaction start mode and the interaction has been successfully completed, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject attempts to use other interaction
start modes. For example, if a user code has been successfully entered for a grant request, the AS
will need to reject requests to an arbitrary redirect URI on the same grant request in order to prevent an
attacker from capturing and altering an active authorization process.</t>
        <section anchor="interaction-redirect">
          <name>Interaction at a Redirected URI</name>
          <t>When the end user is directed to an arbitrary URI through the "redirect" mode (<xref target="response-interact-redirect"> </xref>), the client instance facilitates opening the URI through the end user's web browser.
The client instance could launch the URI through the system browser, provide a clickable
link, redirect the user through HTTP response codes, or display the URI in a form
the end user can use to launch, such as a multidimensional barcode. In all cases, the URI
is accessed with an HTTP GET request, and the resulting page is assumed to allow direct interaction
with the end user through an HTTP user agent.
With this method, it is common (though not required) for the RO to be the same party as the end user, since
the client instance has to communicate the redirection URI to the end user.</t>
          <t>In many cases, the URI indicates a web page hosted at the AS, allowing the
AS to authenticate the end user as the RO and interactively provide consent.
The URI value is used to identify the grant request being authorized.
If the URI cannot be associated with a currently active
request, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> display an error to the RO and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> attempt
to redirect the RO back to any client instance, even if a redirect finish method is supplied (<xref target="request-interact-callback-redirect"> </xref>).
If the URI is not hosted by the AS directly, the means of communication between
the AS and the service provided by this URI are out of scope for this specification.</t>
          <t>The client instance <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> modify the URI when launching it;
in particular, the client instance <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> add any parameters to the URI.
The URI <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be reachable from the end user's browser, though
the URI <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be opened on a separate device from the client instance
itself. The URI <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be accessible from an HTTP GET
request, and it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be protected by HTTPS, be
hosted on a server local to the RO's browser ("localhost"), or
use an application-specific URI scheme that is loaded on the end user's device.</t>

          <t>When the end user is directed to enter a short code through the "user_code" mode (<xref target="response-interact-usercode"> </xref>), the client instance communicates the user code to the end user and
directs the end user to enter that code at an associated URI.
The client instance <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
format the user code in such a way as to facilitate memorability and transfer of the
code, so long as this formatting does not alter the value as accepted at the user code
URI. For example, a client instance receiving the user code "A1BC3DFF" could choose to
display this to the user as "A1BC 3DFF", breaking up the long string into two shorter
strings.</t>
          <t>When processing input codes, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> transform the input string to remove invalid characters.
In the above example, the space in between the two parts would be removed upon its
entry into the interactive form at the user code URI. Additionally, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat
user input as case insensitive. For example, if the user inputs the string "a1bc 3DFF", the
AS will treat the input the same as "A1BC3DFF". To facilitate this, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
that the AS use only ASCII letters and numbers as valid characters for the user code.</t>
          <t>It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the AS choose from character values that are easily copied and typed without ambiguity.
For example, some glyphs have multiple Unicode code points for the same visual character, and the end user
could potentially type a different character than what the AS has returned.
For additional considerations of internationalized character strings, see <xref target="RFC8264"/>.</t>
          <t>This mode is designed to be used when the client instance is not able to communicate or facilitate launching
an arbitrary URI. The associated URI could be statically configured with the client instance or

<xref target="security-ssrf"/>.</t>
          <t>When receiving the request, the client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> parse the JSON object
and validate the hash value as described in
<xref target="interaction-hash"/>. If either fails, the client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return an <tt>unknown_interaction</tt> error (<xref target="response-error"/>). If the hash validates, the client instance sends
a continuation request to the AS as described in <xref target="continue-after-interaction"/>, using the interaction
reference value received here.</t>

        <section anchor="interaction-hash">
          <name>Calculating the Interaction Hash</name>

          <t>The "hash" parameter in the request to the client instance's callback URI ties
the front-channel response to an ongoing request by using values
known only to the parties involved. This security mechanism allows the client instance to protect itself against
several kinds of session fixation and injection attacks as discussed in <xref target="security-interact-hash"/>. The AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
always provide this hash, and the client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> validate the hash when received.</t>
          <t>To calculate the "hash" value, the party doing the calculation
creates a hash base string by concatenating the following values in the following order
using a single newline (0x0A) character to separate them:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>the "nonce" value sent by the client instance in the interaction <tt>finish</tt> field of the initial request (<xref target="request-interact-finish"> </xref>)</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>the AS's nonce value from the interaction finish response (<xref target="response-interact-finish"> </xref>)</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>the "interact_ref" returned from the AS as part of the interaction finish method (<xref target="interaction-finish"> </xref>)</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>the grant endpoint URI the client instance used to make its initial request (<xref target="request"> </xref>)</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>There is no padding or whitespace before or after any of the lines
and no trailing newline character. The following non-normative example shows a constructed
hash base string consisting of these four elements.</t>

          <t>The party then hashes the bytes of the ASCII encoding of this string with the appropriate algorithm
based on the "hash_method" parameter under the "finish" key of the interaction finish request (<xref target="request-interact-finish"> </xref>). The resulting
byte array from the hash function is then encoded using URL-Safe base64
with no padding <xref target="RFC4648"/>. The resulting string is the hash value.</t>
          <t>If provided, the "hash_method" value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be one of the hash name strings defined in the
IANA "Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry" <xref target="HASH-ALG"></xref>.
If the "hash_method" value is not present in the client instance's

      <name>Continuing a Grant Request</name>
      <t>While it is possible for the AS to return an approved grant response (<xref target="response"> </xref>) with all the
client instance's requested information (including access tokens (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) and
subject information (<xref target="response-subject"></xref>)) immediately, it's more common that the AS will
place the grant request into the <em>pending</em> state and require communication with
the client instance several times over the lifetime of a grant request.
This is often part of facilitating interaction (<xref target="authorization"> </xref>), but it could
also be used to allow the AS and client instance to continue negotiating the parameters of
the original grant request (<xref target="request"> </xref>) through modification of the request.</t>
      <t>The ability to continue an already-started request allows the client instance to perform several
important functions, including presenting additional information from interaction,
modifying the initial request, and revoking a grant request in progress.</t>
      <t>To enable this ongoing negotiation, the AS provides a continuation API to the client software.
The AS returns a <tt>continue</tt> field
in the response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) that contains information the client instance needs to
access this API, including a URI to access
as well as a special access token to use during the requests, called the "continuation access token".</t>
      <t>All requests to the continuation API are protected by a bound continuation access token.
The continuation access token is bound to the same key and method the client instance used to make
the initial request (or its most recent rotation). As a consequence,
when the client instance makes any calls to the continuation URI, the client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> present
the continuation access token as described in <xref target="use-access-token"/> and present
proof of the client instance's key (or its most recent rotation)
by signing the request as described in <xref target="binding-keys"/>.
The AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> validate the signature and ensure that it is bound to the appropriate key for
the continuation access token.</t>
      <t>Access tokens other than the continuation access tokens <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be usable for continuation
requests. Conversely, continuation access tokens <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be usable to make authorized requests to
RSs, even if co-located within the AS.</t>
      <t>In the following non-normative example, the client instance makes a POST request to a unique URI and signs
the request with HTTP message signatures:</t>
      <sourcecode type="http-message"><![CDATA[
POST /continue/KSKUOMUKM HTTP/1.1
Authorization: GNAP 80UPRY5NM33OMUKMKSKU
Host: server.example.com
Content-Length: 0
Signature-Input: sig1=...
Signature: sig1=...
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>The AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to tell from the client instance's request which specific ongoing request
is being accessed, using a combination of the continuation URI and
the continuation access token.
If the AS cannot determine a single active grant request to map the
continuation request to, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return an <tt>invalid_continuation</tt> error (<xref target="response-error"/>).</t>
      <t>In the following non-normative example, the client instance makes a POST request to a stable continuation endpoint
URI with the interaction reference (<xref target="continue-after-interaction"> </xref>),
includes the access token, and signs with HTTP message signatures:</t>
      <sourcecode type="http-message"><![CDATA[

Content-Digest: sha-256=...

{
  "interact_ref": "4IFWWIKYBC2PQ6U56NL1"
}
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>In the following non-normative alternative example, the client instance had been provided a continuation URI unique to this ongoing grant request:</t>
      <sourcecode type="http-message"><![CDATA[

{
  "interact_ref": "4IFWWIKYBC2PQ6U56NL1"
}
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>In both cases, the AS determines which grant is being asked for based on the URI and continuation access token provided.</t>
      <t>If a <tt>wait</tt> parameter was included in the continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>), the
client instance <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> call the continuation URI prior to waiting the number of
seconds indicated. If no <tt>wait</tt> period is indicated, the client instance
<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> poll immediately and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
wait at least 5 seconds. If the client instance does not respect the
given wait period, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return the <tt>too_fast</tt> error (<xref target="response-error"/>).</t>
      <t>The response from the AS is a JSON object of a grant response and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain any of the
fields described in <xref target="response"/>, as described in more detail in the
subsections below.</t>
      <t>If the AS determines that the client instance can
make further requests to the continuation API, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a new
continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>).
The new continuation response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a continuation access token as well, and
this token <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be a new access token, invalidating the previous access token.
If the AS does not return a new continuation response, the client instance
<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> make an additional continuation request. If a client instance does so,
the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return an <tt>invalid_continuation</tt> error (<xref target="response-error"/>).</t>
      <t>For continuation functions that require the client instance to send message content, the content <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
a JSON object.</t>
      <t>For all requests to the grant continuation API, the AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> make use of long polling mechanisms such as those discussed in <xref target="RFC6202"/>. That is to say, instead of
returning the current status immediately, the long polling technique
allows the AS additional time to process and fulfill the request before returning the HTTP response
to the client instance. For example, when the AS receives a continuation request but the
grant request is in the <em>processing</em> state, the AS could wait until the grant request has moved
to the <em>pending</em> or <em>approved</em> state before returning the response message.</t>
      <section anchor="continue-after-interaction">
        <name>Continuing after a Completed Interaction</name>
        <t>When the AS responds to the client instance's <tt>finish</tt> method as in <xref target="interaction-callback"/>, this
response includes an interaction reference. The client instance <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include that value as the field
<tt>interact_ref</tt> in a POST request to the continuation URI.</t>

}
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>Since the interaction reference is a one-time-use value as described in <xref target="interaction-callback"/>,
if the client instance needs to make additional continuation calls after this request, the client instance
<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include the interaction reference in subsequent calls. If the AS detects a client instance
submitting an interaction reference when the request is not in the <em>pending</em> state, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
return a <tt>too_many_attempts</tt> error (<xref target="response-error"/>) and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> invalidate
the ongoing request by moving it to the <em>finalized</em> state.</t>
        <t>If the grant request is in the <em>approved</em> state, the grant response (<xref target="response"> </xref>) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain any
newly created access tokens (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) or
newly released subject information (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>). The response <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain
a new continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) as described above. The response
<bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> contain any interaction responses (<xref target="response-interact"> </xref>).</t>

        <t>For example, if the request is successful in causing the AS to issue access tokens and
release opaque subject claims, the response could look like this:</t>

        <t>With the above example, the client instance cannot make an additional continuation request because
a <tt>continue</tt> field is not included.</t>
        <t>In the following non-normative example, the RO has denied the client instance's request, and the AS responds with the following response:</t>

        <t>In the preceding example, the AS includes the <tt>continue</tt> field in the response. Therefore, the client instance can continue the grant negotiation process, perhaps modifying the request as discussed in <xref target="continue-modify"/>.</t>

        <t>When the client instance does not include a <tt>finish</tt> parameter, the client instance will often need to

        <t>Since this response does not include a <tt>continue</tt> field, the client instance cannot continue to

      </section>
      <section anchor="continue-modify">
        <name>Modifying an Existing Request</name>
        <t>The client instance might need to modify an ongoing request, whether or not tokens have already been
issued or subject information has already been released. In such cases, the client instance makes an HTTP PATCH
request to the continuation URI and includes any fields it needs to modify. Fields
that aren't included in the request are considered unchanged from the original request.</t>
        <t>A grant request associated with a modification request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be in the <em>approved</em> or <em>pending</em> state.
When the AS receives a valid modification request, the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> place the grant request into the
<em>processing</em> state and re-evaluate the authorization in the new context created by the update
request, since the extent and context of the request could have changed.</t>
        <t>The client instance <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include the <tt>access_token</tt> and <tt>subject</tt> fields as described in Sections <xref target="request-token" format="counter"/>
and <xref target="request-subject" format="counter"/>. Inclusion of these fields override any values in the initial request,
which <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> trigger additional requirements and policies by the AS. For example, if the client instance is asking for
more access, the AS could require additional interaction with the RO to gather additional consent.
If the client instance is asking for more limited access, the AS could determine that sufficient authorization
has been granted to the client instance and return the more limited access rights immediately.
If the grant request was previously in the <em>approved</em> state, the AS could decide to remember the larger scale of access rights associated
with the grant request, allowing the client instance to make subsequent requests of different
subsets of granted access. The details of this processing are out of scope for this specification,
but a one possible approach is as follows:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
            <t>A client instance requests access to <tt>Foo</tt>, and this is granted by the RO. This results in an access token: <tt>AT1</tt>.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The client instance later modifies the grant request to include <tt>Foo</tt> and <tt>Bar</tt> together. Since the client instance was previously granted <tt>Foo</tt> under this grant request, the RO is prompted to allow the client instance access to <tt>Foo</tt> and <tt>Bar</tt> together. This results in a new access token: <tt>AT2</tt>. This access token has access to both <tt>Foo</tt> and <tt>Bar</tt>. The rights of the original access token <tt>AT1</tt> are not modified.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The client instance makes another grant modification to ask only for <tt>Bar</tt>. Since the client instance was previously granted <tt>Foo</tt> and <tt>Bar</tt> together under this grant request, the RO is not prompted, and the access to <tt>Bar</tt> is granted in a new access token: <tt>AT3</tt>. This new access token does not allow access to <tt>Foo</tt>.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The original access token <tt>AT1</tt> expires, and the client seeks a new access token to replace it. The client instance makes another grant modification to ask only for <tt>Foo</tt>. Since the client instance was previously granted <tt>Foo</tt> and <tt>Bar</tt> together under this grant request, the RO is not prompted, and the access to <tt>Foo</tt> is granted in a new access token: <tt>AT4</tt>. This new access token does not allow access to <tt>Bar</tt>.</t>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <t>All four access tokens are independent of each other and associated with the same underlying grant request. Each of these access tokens could possibly also be rotated using token management, if available. For example, instead of asking for a new token to replace <tt>AT1</tt>, the client instance could ask for a refresh of <tt>AT1</tt> using the rotation method of the token management API. This would result in a refreshed <tt>AT1</tt> with a different token value and expiration from the original <tt>AT1</tt> but with the same access rights of allowing only access to <tt>Foo</tt>.</t>
        <t>The client instance <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include the <tt>interact</tt> field as described in <xref target="request-interact"/>.
Inclusion of this field indicates that the client instance is capable of driving interaction with
the end user, and this field replaces any values from a previous request. The AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> respond to any
of the interaction responses as described in <xref target="response-interact"/>, just like it would to a new
request.</t>
        <t>The client instance <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include the <tt>user</tt> field as described in <xref target="request-user"/> to present new assertions
or information about the end user. The AS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> check that this presented user information is
consistent with any user information previously presented by the client instance or otherwise
associated with this grant request.</t>
        <t>The client instance <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include the <tt>client</tt> field of the request, since the client
instance is assumed not to have changed. Modification of client instance information, including
rotation of keys associated with the client instance, is outside the
scope of this specification.</t>

<t>The client instance <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include post-interaction responses such as those described in <xref target="continue-after-interaction"/>.</t>
        <t>Modification requests <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> alter previously issued access tokens. Instead, any access
tokens issued from a continuation are considered new, separate access tokens. The AS
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> revoke previously issued access tokens after a modification has occurred.</t>
        <t>If the modified request can be granted immediately by the AS (the grant request is in the <em>approved</em> state),
the grant response (<xref target="response"> </xref>) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain any newly created access tokens (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>) or
newly released subject claims (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>). The response <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain
a new continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) as described above. If interaction

        <t>This allows the client instance to make an eventual continuation call. The client instance later realizes that it now
needs "write" access in addition to the "read" access. Since this is an expansion of what
it asked for previously, the client instance also includes a new interaction field in case the AS needs
to interact with the RO again to gather additional authorization. Note that the client instance's
nonce and callback are different from the initial request. Since the original callback was
already used in the initial exchange and the callback is intended for one-time use, a new one
needs to be included in order to use the callback again.</t>

          <t>The means of dereferencing this reference to a key value and proofing mechanism are out of scope for this specification.
Commonly, key references are created by the AS and do not necessarily need
to be understood by the client. These types of key references are an
internal reference to the AS, such as an identifier of a record in a database.
In other applications, it can be useful to use key references that are resolvable
by both clients and the AS, which could be accomplished by a client publishing
a public key at a URI, for example. For interoperability, this method could later be described
as an extension, but doing so is out of scope for this specification.</t>

When symmetric keys are used in GNAP, a key management system or secure key derivation mechanism <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used to supply the keys.

        <name>Presenting Access Tokens</name>
        <t>Access tokens are issued to client instances in GNAP to allow the client instance to make
an authorized call to an API.
The method the client instance uses to send an access token depends on whether
the token is bound to a key and, if so, which proofing method is associated
with the key. This information is conveyed by the
<tt>key</tt> parameter and the <tt>bearer</tt> flag in the access token response structure (<xref target="response-token-single"> </xref>).</t>
        <t>If the <tt>flags</tt> field does not contain the <tt>bearer</tt> flag and the <tt>key</tt> is absent, the access token
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent using the same key and proofing mechanism that the client instance used
in its initial request (or its most recent rotation).</t>
        <t>If the <tt>flags</tt> field does not contain the <tt>bearer</tt> flag and the <tt>key</tt> value is an object as

        <t>The <tt>httpsig</tt> method also defines default behavior when it is passed as a string form,
using the signature algorithm specified by the associated key

using the following shortened form:</t>
        <sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[

        <t>All key binding methods used by this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> cover all relevant portions
of the request, including anything that would change the nature of the request, to allow
for secure validation of the request. Relevant aspects include
the URI being called, the HTTP method being used, any relevant HTTP headers and
values, and the HTTP message content itself. The verifier of the signed message
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> validate all components of the signed message to ensure that nothing
has been tampered with or substituted in a way that would change the nature of
the request. Definitions of key binding methods <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> enumerate how these
requirements are fulfilled.</t>
        <t>When a key proofing mechanism is bound to an access token, the key being presented <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
be the key associated with the access token, and the access token <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be covered
by the signature method of the proofing mechanism.</t>

<t>The key binding methods in this section <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used by other
components making calls as part of GNAP, such as the extensions allowing the
RS to make calls to the AS defined in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-gnap-resource-servers"/>. To facilitate this extended use,
"signer" and "verifier" are used as generic terms in the subsections below.
In the core functions of GNAP specified in this document, the "signer" is the
client instance, and the "verifier" is the AS (for grant requests) or RS (for
resource requests), as appropriate.</t>
        <t>When used for delegation in GNAP, these key binding mechanisms allow
the AS to ensure that the keys presented by the client instance in the initial request are in
control of the party calling any follow-up or continuation requests. To facilitate
this requirement, the continuation response (<xref target="response-continue"> </xref>) includes
an access token bound to the client instance's key (<xref target="request-client"> </xref>), and that key (or its most recent rotation)
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be proved in all continuation requests
(<xref target="continue-request"/>). Token management requests (<xref target="token-management"/>) are similarly bound
to either the access token's own key or, in the case of bearer tokens, the client instance's key.</t>
        <t>In the following subsections, unless otherwise noted, the <tt>RS256</tt> JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) signature algorithm (defined in <xref section="3.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7518"/>) is applied
using the following RSA key (presented here in JWK format):</t>

      <t>GNAP provides a rich structure for describing the protected resources
hosted by RSs and accessed by client software. This structure is used when
the client instance requests an access token (<xref target="request-token"> </xref>) and when
an access token is returned (<xref target="response-token"> </xref>). GNAP's structure is
designed to be analogous to the OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests
data structure defined in <xref target="RFC9396"/>.</t>
      <t>The root of this structure is a JSON array. The elements of the JSON
array represent rights of access that are associated with the
access token. Individual rights of access can be defined by the RS as
either an object or a string. The resulting access is the union of all elements
within the array.</t>
      <t>The access associated with the access token is described
using objects that each contain multiple
dimensions of access. Each object contains a <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> <tt>type</tt>

the structure of the rest of the object. There is no expected

supports. The AS <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> do any collation or normalization of data
types during comparison. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that designers of general-purpose

usable across different types of APIs. This specification does not require the
use of these common fields by an API definition but, instead, provides them as
reusable generic components for API designers to make use of. The allowable
values of all fields are determined by the API being protected, as defined
by a particular <tt>type</tt> value.</t>

      <t>The following non-normative example describes three kinds of access (read, write, and delete) to each of
two different locations and two different data types (metadata and images) for a single access token
using the fictitious <tt>photo-api</tt> type definition.</t>

            "delete"
        ],

      <t>While the exact semantics of interpreting the fields of an access
request object are subject to the definition of the <tt>type</tt>,
it is expected that the access requested for each object in the array
is the cross-product of all fields of the object. That is to
say, the object represents a request for all <tt>actions</tt> listed
to be used at all <tt>locations</tt> listed for all possible <tt>datatypes</tt>
listed within the object. Assuming the request above was granted,
the client instance could assume that it
would be able to do a <tt>read</tt> action against the <tt>images</tt> on the first server
as well as a <tt>delete</tt> action on the <tt>metadata</tt> of the second server, or any other
combination of these fields, using the same access token.</t>
      <t>To request a different combination of access,
such as requesting one of the possible <tt>actions</tt> against one of the possible <tt>locations</tt>
and a different choice of possible <tt>actions</tt> against a different one of the possible <tt>locations</tt>, the
client instance can include multiple separate objects in the <tt>resources</tt> array.
The total access rights for the resulting access
token are the union of all objects. The following non-normative example uses the same fictitious <tt>photo-api</tt>
type definition to request a single access token with more specifically
targeted access rights by using two discrete objects within the request.</t>

access rights <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be communicated as a string known to
the AS representing the access being requested. Just like access rights communicated

access at a protected resource. In the following non-normative example,
three distinct resource access rights are being requested.</t>

valid JSON string; therefore, it could include spaces, Unicode

situations, the value is intended to be

        <t>This functionality is similar in practice to OAuth 2.0's <tt>scope</tt> parameter <xref target="RFC6749"/>, where a single string

        <t>The requested access is the union of all elements of the array, including both objects and
reference strings.</t>
        <t>In order to facilitate the use of both object and reference strings to access the same
kind of APIs, the API designer can define a clear mapping between these forms.
One possible approach for choosing reference string values is to use the same value as the
<tt>type</tt> parameter from the fully specified object, with the API defining a set of default
behaviors in this case. For example, an API definition could declare the following string:</t>
        <sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
"access": [
    "photo-api"
]
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>As being equivalent to the following fully defined object:</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>In addition to the normative requirements in this document, implementors are strongly encouraged to consider these additional security considerations in implementations and deployments of GNAP.</t>
      <section anchor="security-tls">
        <name>TLS Protection in Transit</name>
        <t>All requests in GNAP made over untrusted network connections have to be made over TLS as outlined in <xref target="BCP195"/>
to protect the contents of the request and response from manipulation and interception by an attacker.
This includes all requests from a client instance to the AS, all requests from the client instance to
an RS, and any requests back to a client instance such as the push-based interaction finish method.
Additionally, all requests between a browser and other components, such as during redirect-based
interaction, need to be made over TLS or use equivalent protection such as a network connection local to the browser ("localhost").</t>
        <t>Even though requests from the client instance to the AS are signed, the signature method alone does not protect
the request from interception by an attacker. TLS protects the response as well as the request,
preventing an attacker from intercepting requested information as it is returned. This is particularly
important in this specification for security artifacts such as nonces and for
personal information such as subject information.</t>

<t>The use of key-bound access tokens does not negate the requirement for protecting calls to the RS with TLS.
The keys and signatures associated with a bound access token will prevent an attacker from using a stolen
token; however, without TLS, an attacker would be able to watch the data being sent to the RS and returned from the RS
during legitimate use of the client instance under attack. Additionally, without TLS, an attacker would be
able to profile the calls made between the client instance and RS, possibly gaining information about the functioning
of the API between the client software and RS software that would otherwise be unknown to the attacker.</t>
        <t>Note that connections from the end user and RO's browser also need to be protected with TLS. This applies during initial
redirects to an AS's components during interaction, during any interaction with the RO, and during
any redirect back to the client instance. Without TLS protection on these portions of the process, an
attacker could wait for a valid request to start and then take over the RO's interaction session.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-signing">
        <name>Signing Requests from the Client Software</name>
        <t>Even though all requests in GNAP need to be transmitted over TLS or its equivalent, the use of TLS
alone is not sufficient to protect all parts of a multi-party and multi-stage protocol like GNAP,
and TLS is not targeted at tying multiple requests to each other over time.
To account for this, GNAP makes use of message-level protection and key presentation mechanisms
that strongly associate a request with a key held by the client instance (see <xref target="secure-requests"/>).</t>
        <t>During the initial request from a client instance to the AS, the client instance has to identify and
prove possession of a cryptographic key. If the key is known to the AS, e.g., previously
registered or dereferenceable to a trusted source, the AS can associate a set of policies to the
client instance identified by the key. Without the requirement that the client instance prove that it holds
that key, the AS could not trust that the connection came from any particular client and could
not apply any associated policies.</t>
        <t>Even more importantly, the client instance proving possession of a
        key on the first request allows the AS to associate future requests
        with each other by binding all future requests in that transaction to
        the same key. The access token used for grant continuation is bound to
        the same key and proofing mechanism used by the client instance in its
        initial request; this means that the client instance needs to prove
        possession of that same key in future requests, which allows the AS to
        be sure that the same client instance is executing the follow-ups for
        a given ongoing grant request. Therefore, the AS has to ensure that
        all subsequent requests for a grant are associated with the same key
        that started the grant or with the most recent rotation of that key.  This
        need holds true even if the initial key is previously unknown to the
        AS, such as would be the case when a client instance creates an
        ephemeral key for its request.  Without this ongoing association, an
        attacker would be able to impersonate a client instance in the midst
        of a grant request, potentially stealing access tokens and subject
        information with impunity.</t>
        <t>Additionally, all access tokens in GNAP default to be associated with the key that was presented
during the grant request that created the access token. This association allows an RS to know that
the presenter of the access token is the same party that the token was issued to, as identified
by their keys. While non-bound bearer tokens are an option in GNAP, these types of tokens
have their own trade-offs, which are discussed in <xref target="security-bearer-tokens"/>.</t>

        <t>TLS functions at the transport layer, ensuring that only the parties on either end of that
connection can read the information passed along that connection. Each time a new connection
is made, such as for a new HTTP request, a new trust that is mostly unrelated to previous
connections is re-established. While modern TLS does make use of session resumption, this still needs to be augmented
with authentication methods to determine the identity of parties on the
connections. In other words, it is not possible with TLS alone to know that the same party is making
a set of calls over time, since each time a new TLS connection is established, both the client and the server (or the server only when using MTLS (<xref target="mtls"/>)) have to validate
the other party's identity. Such a verification can be achieved via methods described in <xref target="RFC9525"/>, but these are not enough to establish the identity of the client instance in many cases.</t>
        <t>To counter this, GNAP defines a set of key binding methods in <xref target="binding-keys"/> that allows authentication and
proof of possession by the caller, which is usually the client instance. These methods are intended to be used in
addition to TLS on all connections.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-mtls">
        <name>MTLS Message Integrity</name>
        <t>The MTLS key proofing mechanism (<xref target="mtls"> </xref>) provides a means for a client instance to present a key
using a certificate at the TLS layer. Since TLS protects the entire HTTP message in transit,
verification of the TLS client certificate presented with the message provides a sufficient binding
between the two. However, since TLS is functioning at a separate layer from HTTP, there is no
direct connection between the TLS key presentation and the message itself, other than the fact that
the message was presented over the TLS channel. That is to say, any HTTP message can be presented
over the TLS channel in question with the same level of trust. The verifier is responsible for
ensuring the key in the TLS client certificate is the one expected for a particular request. For
example, if the request is a grant request (<xref target="request"> </xref>), the AS needs to compare the TLS client
certificate presented at the TLS layer to the key identified in the request content itself (either
by value or through a referenced identifier).</t>
        <t>Furthermore, the prevalence of the TLS terminating reverse proxy (TTRP) pattern in deployments adds
a wrinkle to the situation. In this common pattern, the TTRP validates the TLS connection and then forwards the HTTP message contents onward to an internal system for processing. The system
processing the HTTP message no longer has access to the original TLS connection's information and
context.

To compensate for this, the TTRP could inject the TLS client certificate into
the forwarded request using the HTTP Client-Cert header field <xref
target="RFC9111"/>, giving the downstream system access to the certificate
information. The TTRP has to be trusted to provide accurate certificate
information, and the connection between the TTRP and the downstream system
also has to be protected. The TTRP could provide some additional assurance,
for example, by adding its own signature to the Client-Cert header field using
HTTP message signatures <xref target="RFC9421"/>. This signature would be
effectively ignored by GNAP (since it would not use GNAP's <tt>tag</tt>
parameter value) but would be understood by the downstream service as part of
its deployment.</t>
        <t>Additional considerations for different types of deployment patterns and key distribution
mechanisms for MTLS are found in <xref target="security-mtls-patterns"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-mtls-patterns">
        <name>MTLS Deployment Patterns</name>
        <t>GNAP does not specify how a client instance's keys could be made known to the AS ahead of time.
The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be used to manage the keys used by client instances when calling
the AS, allowing the AS to trust a root key from a trusted authority. This method is particularly
relevant to the MTLS key proofing method, where the client instance
presents its certificate to the AS as part of the TLS connection. An AS using PKI to validate the
MTLS connection would need to ensure that the presented certificate was issued by a trusted certificate
authority before allowing the connection to continue. PKI-based certificates would allow a key to be revoked
and rotated through management at the certificate authority without requiring additional registration
or management at the AS. The PKI required to manage mutually authenticated TLS has historically been
difficult to deploy, especially at scale, but it remains an appropriate solution for systems where
the required management overhead is not an impediment.</t>
        <t>MTLS in GNAP need not use a PKI backing, as self-signed certificates and certificates from untrusted
authorities can still be presented as part of a TLS connection. In this case, the verifier would
validate the connection but accept whatever certificate was presented by the client software. This
specific certificate can then be bound to all future connections from that client software by
being bound to the resulting access tokens, in a trust-on-first-use pattern. See <xref target="security-mtls"/>
for more considerations on MTLS as a key proofing mechanism.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-keys">
        <name>Protection of Client Instance Key Material</name>
        <t>Client instances are identified by their unique keys, and anyone with access to a client instance's key material
will be able to impersonate that client instance to all parties. This is true for both calls to the AS
as well as calls to an RS using an access token bound to the client instance's unique key. As a consequence, it is of utmost importance for a client instance to protect its private key material.</t>


<t>Different types of client software have different methods for creating, managing, and registering
keys. GNAP explicitly allows for ephemeral clients such as single-page applications (SPAs) and single-user clients (such as
mobile applications) to create and present their own keys during the initial grant request without any explicit pre-registration step. The client
software can securely generate a key pair on the device and present the public key, along with proof of holding the associated
private key, to the AS as part of the initial request. To facilitate trust in these ephemeral keys,
GNAP further allows for an extensible set of client information to be passed with the request. This
information can include device posture and third-party attestations of the client software's provenance
and authenticity, depending on the needs and capabilities of the client software and its deployment.</t>
        <t>From GNAP's perspective, each distinct key is a different client instance. However, multiple client
instances can be grouped together by an AS policy and treated similarly to each other. For instance,
if an AS knows of several different keys for different servers within a cluster, the AS can
decide that authorization of one of these servers applies to all other servers within the cluster. An AS
that chooses to do this needs to be careful with how it groups different client keys together in its policy,
since the breach of one instance would have direct effects on the others in the cluster.</t>
        <t>Additionally, if an end user controls multiple instances of a single type of client software, such as
having an application installed on multiple devices, each of these instances is expected to have a
separate key and be issued separate access tokens. However, if the AS is able to group these separate
instances together as described above, it can streamline the authorization process for new instances
of the same client software. For example, if two client instances can present proof of a valid installation
of a piece of client software, the AS would be able to associate the approval of the first instance of this
software to all related instances. The AS could then choose to bypass an explicit prompt of the RO for approval during authorization, since such approval has already been given. An AS doing such
a process would need to take assurance measures that the different instances are in fact correlated
and authentic, as well as ensure that the expected RO is in control of the client instance.</t>
        <t>Finally, if multiple instances of client software each have the same key, then from GNAP's perspective,
these are functionally the same client instance as GNAP has no reasonable way to differentiate between
them. This situation could happen if multiple instances within a cluster can securely share secret
information among themselves. Even though there are multiple copies of the software, the shared key
makes these copies all present as a single instance. It is considered bad practice to share keys between
copies of software unless they are very tightly integrated with each other and can be closely managed.
It is particularly bad practice to allow an end user to copy keys between client instances and to
willingly use the same key in multiple instances.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-as">
        <name>Protection of Authorization Server</name>
        <t>The AS performs critical functions in GNAP, including authenticating client software, managing interactions
with end users to gather consent and provide notice, and issuing access tokens for client instances
to present to RSs. As such, protecting the AS is central to any GNAP deployment.</t>
        <t>If an attacker is able to gain control over an AS, they would be able to create fraudulent tokens and
manipulate registration information to allow for malicious clients. These tokens and clients would
be trusted by other components in the ecosystem under the protection of the AS.</t>
        <t>If the AS uses signed access tokens, an attacker in control of the AS's signing keys would
be able to manufacture fraudulent tokens for use at RSs under the protection of the AS.</t>
        <t>If an attacker is able to impersonate an AS, they would be able to trick legitimate client instances
into making signed requests for information that could potentially be proxied to a real AS. To combat
this, all communications to the AS need to be made over TLS or its equivalent, and the software
making the connection has to validate the certificate chain of the host it is connecting to.</t>
        <t>Consequently, protecting, monitoring, and auditing the AS is paramount to preserving the security
of a GNAP-protected ecosystem. The AS presents attackers with a valuable target for attack.
Fortunately, the core focus and function of the AS is to provide security for the ecosystem, unlike
the RS whose focus is to provide an API or the client software whose focus is to access the API.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-symmetric">
        <name>Symmetric and Asymmetric Client Instance Keys</name>
        <t>Many of the cryptographic methods used by GNAP for key proofing can support both asymmetric and symmetric
cryptography, and they can be extended to use a wide variety of mechanisms.
Implementors will find the available guidelines on cryptographic key management provided in <xref target="RFC4107"/> useful. While symmetric
cryptographic systems have some benefits in speed and simplicity, they have a distinct drawback --
both parties need access to the same key in order to do both signing and verification of
the message.
When more than two parties share the same symmetric key,
data origin authentication is not provided.  Any party that knows the
symmetric key can compute a valid MAC; therefore, the
contents could originate from any one of the parties.</t>
        <t>Use of symmetric cryptography means that when the client instance calls the AS to request a token, the
AS needs to know the exact value of the client instance's key (or be able to derive it) in
order to validate the key proof signature. With asymmetric keys, the client needs to only
send its public key to the AS to allow for verification that the client holds the associated
private key, regardless of whether or not that key was pre-registered with the AS.</t>
        <t>Symmetric keys also have the expected advantage of providing better protection against quantum
threats in the future. Also, these types of keys (and their secure derivations) are widely
supported among many cloud-based key management systems.</t>
        <t>When used to bind to an access token, a key value must be known by the RS in order
to validate the proof signature on the request. Common methods for communicating these proofing
keys include putting information in a structured access token and allowing the RS to look
up the associated key material against the value of the access token. With symmetric cryptography,
both of these methods would expose the signing key to the RS and, in the case of a structured
access token, potentially to any party that can see the access token itself unless the token's
payload has been encrypted. Any of these parties would then be able to make calls using the
access token by creating a valid signature using the shared key. With asymmetric cryptography, the RS needs
to only know the public key associated with the token in order to validate the request; therefore, the RS cannot
create any new signed calls.</t>
        <t>While both signing approaches are allowed, GNAP treats these two classes of keys somewhat
differently. Only the public portion of asymmetric keys are allowed to be sent by value
in requests to the AS when establishing a connection. Since sending a symmetric key (or
the private portion of an asymmetric key) would expose the signing material to any parties
on the request path, including any attackers, sending these kinds of keys by value is prohibited.
Symmetric keys can still be used by client instances, but only if the client instance can send a reference to the key and
not its value. This approach allows the AS to use pre-registered symmetric keys as well
as key derivation schemes to take advantage of symmetric cryptography without requiring
key distribution at runtime, which would expose the keys in transit.</t>
        <t>Both the AS and client software can use systems such as hardware security modules to strengthen
their key security storage and generation for both asymmetric and symmetric keys (see also <xref target="key-protection"/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-access-tokens">
        <name>Generation of Access Tokens</name>
        <t>The contents of access tokens need to be such that only the generating AS would be able to
create them, and the contents cannot be manipulated by an attacker to gain different or additional
access rights.</t>
        <t>One method for accomplishing this is to use a cryptographically random value for the access token,
generated by the AS using a secure randomization function with sufficiently high entropy. The odds of
an attacker guessing the output of the randomization function to collide with a valid access token
are exceedingly small, and even then, the attacker would not have any control over what the
access token would represent since that information would be held close by the AS.</t>
        <t>Another method for accomplishing this is to use a structured token that is cryptographically signed.
In this case, the payload of the access token declares to the RS what the token is good for, but
the signature applied by the AS during token generation covers this payload. Only the AS can create
such a signature; therefore, only the AS can create such a signed token. The odds of an attacker
being able to guess a signature value with a useful payload are exceedingly small. This technique
only works if all targeted RSs check the signature of the access token. Any RS that does not
validate the signature of all presented tokens would be susceptible to injection of a modified
or falsified token. Furthermore, an AS has to carefully protect the keys used to sign access
tokens, since anyone with access to these signing keys would be able to create seemingly valid
access tokens using them.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-bearer-tokens">
        <name>Bearer Access Tokens</name>

	<t>Bearer access tokens can be used by any party that has access to the token itself, without any additional
information. As a natural consequence, any RS that a bearer token is presented to has the technical
capability of presenting that bearer token to another RS, as long as the token is valid. It also
means that any party that is able to capture the token value in storage or in transit is able to
use the access token. While bearer tokens are inherently simpler, this simplicity has been misapplied
and abused in making needlessly insecure systems. The downsides of bearer tokens have become more
pertinent lately as stronger authentication systems have caused some attacks to shift to target
tokens and APIs.</t>
        <t>In GNAP, key-bound access tokens are the default due to their higher security properties. While
bearer tokens can be used in GNAP, their use should be limited to cases where the simplicity
benefits outweigh the significant security downsides. One common deployment pattern is to use a
gateway that takes in key-bound tokens on the outside and verifies the signatures on the incoming
requests but translates the requests to a bearer token for use by trusted internal systems. The
bearer tokens are never issued or available outside of the internal systems, greatly limiting the
exposure of the less-secure tokens but allowing the internal deployment to benefit from the
advantages of bearer tokens.</t>

      <section anchor="security-bound-tokens">
        <name>Key-Bound Access Tokens</name>
        <t>Key-bound access tokens, as the name suggests, are bound to a specific key and must be
presented along with proof of that key during use. The key itself is not presented at the same
time as the token, so even if a token value is captured, it cannot be used to make a new request. This
is particularly true for an RS, which will see the token value but will not see the keys used
to make the request (assuming asymmetric cryptography is in use, see <xref target="security-symmetric"/>).</t>
        <t>Key-bound access tokens provide this additional layer of protection only when the RS checks the
signature of the message presented with the token. Acceptance of an invalid presentation signature,
or failure to check the signature entirely, would allow an attacker to make calls with a captured
access token without having access to the related signing key material.</t>
        <t>In addition to validating the signature of the presentation message itself,
the RS also needs to ensure that the signing key used is appropriate for the presented token.
If an RS does not ensure that the right keys were used to sign a message with a specific
token, an attacker would be able to capture an access token and sign the request with their own
keys, thereby negating the benefits of using key-bound access tokens.</t>
        <t>The RS also needs to ensure that sufficient portions of the message are covered by the
signature. Any items outside the signature could still affect the API's processing decisions,
but these items would not be strongly bound to the token presentation. As such, an attacker
could capture a valid request and then manipulate portions of the request outside of the
signature envelope in order to cause unwanted actions at the protected API.</t>
        <t>Some key-bound tokens are susceptible to replay attacks, depending on the details of the signing method
used. Therefore, key proofing mechanisms used with access tokens need
to use replay-protection mechanisms covered under the signature such as a per-message nonce, a
reasonably short time validity window, or other uniqueness constraints. The details of using these
will vary depending on the key proofing mechanism in use. For example, HTTP message signatures
have both a <tt>created</tt> and <tt>nonce</tt> signature parameter as well as the ability to cover significant
portions of the HTTP message. All of these can be used to limit the attack surface.</t>

      <section anchor="security-credentials">
        <name>Exposure of End-User Credentials to Client Instance</name>
        <t>As a delegation protocol, one of the main goals of GNAP is to prevent the client software from being
exposed to any credentials or information about the end user or RO as a requirement
of the delegation process. By using the variety of interaction mechanisms, the RO can
interact with the AS without ever authenticating to the client software and without the client
software having to impersonate the RO through replay of their credentials.</t>
        <t>Consequently, no interaction methods defined in this specification require the end user to enter their
credentials, but it is technologically possible for an extension to be defined to carry such values.
Such an extension would be dangerous as it would allow rogue client software to directly collect, store,
and replay the end user's credentials outside of any legitimate use within a GNAP request.</t>
        <t>The concerns of such an extension could be mitigated through use of a challenge and response
unlocked by the end user's credentials. For example, the AS presents a challenge as part of
an interaction start method, and the client instance signs that challenge using a key derived
from a password presented by the end user. It would be possible for the client software to
collect this password in a secure software enclave without exposing the password to the rest
of the client software or putting it across the wire to the AS. The AS can validate this challenge
response against a known password for the identified end user. While an approach such as this does
not remove all of the concerns surrounding such a password-based scheme, it is at least
possible to implement in a more secure fashion than simply collecting and replaying
the password. Even so, such schemes should only ever be used by trusted clients due to
the ease of abusing them.</t>

      <section anchor="security-mixup">
        <name>Mixing Up Authorization Servers</name>
        <t>If a client instance is able to work with multiple ASes simultaneously, it is possible
for an attacker to add a compromised AS to the client instance's configuration and cause the
client software to start a request at the compromised AS. This AS could then proxy the client's
request to a valid AS in order to attempt to get the RO to approve access for
the legitimate client instance.</t>

        <t>A client instance needs to always be aware of which AS it is talking to throughout a grant process and ensure
that any callback for one AS does not get conflated with the callback to different AS. The interaction finish
hash calculation in <xref target="interaction-hash"/> allows a client instance to protect against this kind of substitution, but only if
the client instance validates the hash. If the client instance does not use an interaction finish method
or does not check the interaction finish hash value, the compromised AS can be granted a valid
access token on behalf of the RO. See Sections 4.5.5 and 5.5 of <xref target="AXELAND2021"/> for details
of one such attack, which has been addressed in this document by including the grant endpoint
in the interaction hash calculation. Note that the client instance still needs to validate the hash for
the attack to be prevented.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-client-userinfo">
        <name>Processing of Client-Presented User Information</name>
        <t>GNAP allows the client instance to present assertions and identifiers of the current user to the AS as
part of the initial request. This information should only ever be taken by the AS as a hint, since the
AS has no way to tell if the represented person is present at the client software without using
an interaction mechanism. This information does not guarantee the given user is there, but it does
constitute a statement by the client software that the AS can take into account.</t>
        <t>For example, if a specific user is claimed to be present prior to interaction, but a different user
is shown to be present during interaction, the AS can either determine this to be an error or signal
to the client instance through returned subject information that the current user has changed from
what the client instance thought. This user information can also be used by the AS to streamline the
interaction process when the user is present. For example, instead of having the user type in their
account identifier during interaction at a redirected URI, the AS can immediately challenge the user
for their account credentials. Alternatively, if an existing session is detected, the AS can
determine that it matches the identifier provided by the client and subsequently skip an explicit
authentication event by the RO.</t>
        <t>In cases where the AS trusts the client software more completely, due to policy
or previous approval of a given client instance, the AS can take this user information as a
statement that the user is present and could issue access tokens and release subject information
without interaction. The AS should only take such action in very limited circumstances, as a
client instance could assert whatever it likes for the user's identifiers in its request. The AS
can limit the possibility of this by issuing randomized opaque identifiers to client instances to
represent different end-user accounts after an initial login.</t>
        <t>When a client instance presents an assertion to the AS, the AS needs to evaluate that assertion. Since
the AS is unlikely to be the intended audience of an assertion held by the client software, the AS will
need to evaluate the assertion in a different context. Even in this case, the AS can still evaluate
that the assertion was generated by a trusted party, was appropriately signed, and is within
any time validity windows stated by the assertion. If the client instance's audience identifier
is known to the AS and can be associated with the client instance's presented key, the AS can also
evaluate that the appropriate client instance is presenting the claimed assertion. All of this
will prevent an attacker from presenting a manufactured assertion or one captured from an
untrusted system. However, without validating the audience of the assertion, a captured assertion
could be presented by the client instance to impersonate a given end user. In such cases, the assertion
offers little more protection than a simple identifier would.</t>
        <t>A special case exists where the AS is the generator of the assertion being presented by the
client instance. In these cases, the AS can validate that it did issue the assertion and
it is associated with the client instance presenting the assertion.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-registration">
        <name>Client Instance Pre-registration</name>
        <t>Each client instance is identified by its own unique key, and for some kinds of client software such as a
web server or backend system, this identification can be facilitated by registering a single key for a piece
of client software ahead of time. This registration can be associated with a set of display attributes to
be used during the authorization process to identify the client software to the user. In these cases,
it can be assumed that only one instance of client software will exist, likely to serve many different
users.</t>

<t>A client's registration record needs to include its identifying key. Furthermore, it is the case that
any clients using symmetric cryptography for key proofing mechanisms need to have their keys pre-registered.
The registration should also include any information that would aid in the authorization process, such as
a display name and logo.
The registration record can also limit a given client to
ask for certain kinds of information or use
specific interaction mechanisms at runtime.
</t>


<t>It also is sensible to pre-register client instances when the software is acting autonomously, without
the need for a runtime approval by an RO or any interaction with an end user. In these cases,
an AS needs to rely on the trust decisions that have been determined prior to runtime to determine
what rights and tokens to grant to a given client instance.</t>
        <t>However, it does not make sense to pre-register many types of clients. Single-page applications (SPAs) and
mobile/desktop applications in particular present problems with pre-registration. For SPAs, the instances
are ephemeral in nature, and long-term registration of a single instance leads to significant storage and
management overhead at the AS. For mobile applications, each installation of the client software is
a separate instance, and sharing a key among all instances would be detrimental to security as the
compromise of any single installation would compromise all copies for all users.</t>
        <t>An AS can treat these classes of client software differently from each other, perhaps by allowing access
to certain high-value APIs only to pre-registered known clients or by requiring an active end-user
delegation of authority to any client software not pre-registered.</t>
        <t>An AS can also provide warnings and caveats to ROs during the authorization process, allowing
the user to make an informed decision regarding the software they are authorizing. For example, if the AS
has vetted the client software and this specific instance, it can present a different authorization
screen compared to a client instance that is presenting all of its information at runtime.</t>
        <t>Finally, an AS can use platform attestations and other signals from the client instance at runtime
to determine whether or not the software making the request is legitimate. The details of such
attestations are outside the scope of this specification, but the <tt>client</tt> portion of a grant request
provides a natural extension point to such information through the "GNAP Client Instance Fields" registry (<xref target="IANA-client-instance"> </xref>).</t>

      <section anchor="security-impersonation">
        <name>Client Instance Impersonation</name>
        <t>If client instances are allowed to set their own user-facing display information, such as a display name and website
URL, a malicious client instance could impersonate legitimate client software for the purposes of tricking
users into authorizing the malicious client.</t>
        <t>Requiring clients to pre-register does not fully mitigate this problem since many pre-registration
systems have self-service portals for management of client registration, allowing authenticated developers
to enter self-asserted information into the management portal.</t>
        <t>An AS can mitigate this by actively filtering all self-asserted values presented by client software,
both dynamically as part of GNAP and through a registration portal, to limit the kinds of impersonation that
	could be done.</t>
        <t>An AS can also warn the RO about the provenance of the information it is displaying, allowing
the RO to make a more informed delegation decision. For example, an AS can visually differentiate
between a client instance that can be traced back to a specific developer's registration and an
instance that has self-asserted its own display information.</t>

      <section anchor="security-client-hosted-logo">
        <name>Client-Hosted Logo URI</name>
        <t>The <tt>logo_uri</tt> client display field defined in <xref target="request-display"/> allows the client instance to specify
a URI from which an image can be fetched for display during authorization decisions. When the URI points to
an externally hosted resource (as opposed to a data: URI), the <tt>logo_uri</tt> field presents challenges in addition to the
considerations in <xref target="security-impersonation"/>.</t>
        <t>When a <tt>logo_uri</tt> is externally hosted, the client software (or the host of the asset) can change the contents of
the logo without informing the AS. Since the logo is considered an aspect of the client software's identity,
this flexibility allows for a more dynamically managed client instance that makes use of the distributed systems.</t>
<t>However, this same flexibility allows the host of the asset to change the hosted file in a malicious way,
such as replacing the image content with malicious software for download or imitating a different piece
of client software. Additionally, the act of fetching the URI could accidentally leak information to the image host
in the HTTP Referer header field, if one is sent. Even though GNAP intentionally does not include security
parameters in front-channel URIs wherever possible, the AS still should take steps to ensure that
this information does not leak accidentally, such as setting a referrer policy on image links or
displaying images only from pages served from a URI with no sensitive security or identity information.</t>
        <t>To avoid these issues, the AS can insist on the use of data: URIs, though that might not be practical for all
types of client software. Alternatively, the AS could pre-fetch the content of the URI and present its own copy
to the RO instead. This practice opens the AS to potential SSRF attacks, as discussed in <xref target="security-ssrf"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="security-browser-interception">
        <name>Interception of Information in the Browser</name>
        <t>Most information passed through the web browser is susceptible to interception and possible manipulation by
elements within the browser such as scripts loaded within pages. Information in the URI is exposed
through browser and server logs, and it can also leak to other parties through HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> headers.</t>
        <t>GNAP's design limits the information passed directly through the browser, allowing for opaque URIs in most circumstances.
For the redirect-based interaction finish mechanism, named query parameters are used to carry
unguessable opaque values. For these, GNAP requires creation and validation of a cryptographic
hash to protect the query parameters added to the URI and associate them with an ongoing grant
process and values not passed in the URI. The client instance has to properly validate this hash to prevent an attacker from
injecting an interaction reference intended for a different AS or client instance.</t>
        <t>Several interaction start mechanisms use URIs created by the AS and passed to the client instance.
While these URIs are opaque to the client instance, it's possible for the AS to include parameters,
paths, and other pieces of information that could leak security data or be manipulated by a party
in the middle of the transaction. An AS implementation can avoid this problem by creating URIs
using unguessable values that are randomized for each new grant request.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-callback-uri">
        <name>Callback URI Manipulation</name>
        <t>The callback URI used in interaction finish mechanisms is defined by the client instance. This URI is
opaque to the AS but can contain information relevant to the client instance's operations. In
particular, the client instance can include state information to allow the callback request to
be associated with an ongoing grant request.</t>
        <t>Since this URI is exposed to the end user's browser, it is susceptible to both logging and manipulation
in transit before the request is made to the client software. As such, a client instance should
never put security-critical or private information into the callback URI in a cleartext form. For example,
if the client software includes a post-redirect target URI in its callback URI to the AS, this target URI
could be manipulated by an attacker, creating an open redirector at the client. Instead,
a client instance can use an unguessable identifier in the URI that can then be used by the client
software to look up the details of the pending request. Since this approach requires some form of statefulness
by the client software during the redirection process, clients that are not capable of holding state
through a redirect should not use redirect-based interaction mechanisms.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-redirect-status-codes">
        <name>Redirection Status Codes</name>

        <t>As described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics"/>, a server should never use
        HTTP status code 307 (Temporary Redirect) to redirect a request that potentially
        contains user credentials. If an HTTP redirect is used for such a
        request, HTTP status code 303 (See Other) should be used
        instead.</t>
	<t>Status code 307 (Temporary Redirect), as defined in the HTTP
	standard <xref target="RFC9110"/>, requires the user agent to preserve
	the method and content of a request, thus submitting the content of
	the POST request to the redirect target.  In the HTTP standard <xref
	target="RFC9110"/>, only status code 303 (See Other) unambiguously
	enforces rewriting the HTTP POST request to an HTTP GET request, which
	eliminates the POST content from the redirected request.  For all
	other status codes, including status code 302 (Found), user agents are
	allowed to keep a redirected POST request as a POST and thus can
	resubmit the content.
	</t>

<t>The use of status code 307 (Temporary Redirect) results in a vulnerability when using the
<tt>redirect</tt> interaction finish method (<xref target="response-interact-finish"> </xref>). With this method, the AS
potentially prompts the RO to enter their credentials in a form that is then submitted back to the
AS (using an HTTP POST request). The AS checks the credentials and, if successful, may immediately
redirect the RO to the client instance's redirect URI. Due to the use of status code 307 (Temporary Redirect), the RO's
user agent now transmits the RO's credentials to the client instance. A malicious client instance
can then use the obtained credentials to impersonate the RO at the AS.</t>
        <t>Redirection away from the initial URI in an interaction session could also leak information found in that
initial URI through the HTTP Referer header field, which would be sent by the user agent to the redirect
target. To avoid such leakage, a server can first redirect to an internal interstitial page without any identifying
or sensitive information on the URI before processing the request. When the user agent is ultimately
redirected from this page, no part of the original interaction URI will be found in the Referer header.</t>

        <name>Interception of Responses from the AS</name>
        <t>Responses from the AS contain information vital to both the security and privacy operations of
GNAP. This information includes nonces used in cryptographic calculations, Subject Identifiers,
assertions, public keys, and information about what client software is requesting and was granted.</t>
        <t>In addition, if bearer tokens are used or keys are issued alongside a bound access token, the
response from the AS contains all information necessary for use of the contained access token. Any
party that is capable of viewing such a response, such as an intermediary proxy, would be able
to exfiltrate and use this token. If the access token is instead bound to the client instance's
presented key, intermediaries no longer have sufficient information to use the token. They can
still, however, gain information about the end user as well as the actions of the client software.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-key-distribution">
        <name>Key Distribution</name>
        <t>GNAP does not define ways for the client instances keys to be provided to the client instances,
particularly in light of how those keys are made known to the AS. These keys could be
generated dynamically on the client software or pre-registered at the AS in a static developer portal.
The keys for client instances could also be distributed as part of the deployment process of instances
of the client software. For example, an application installation framework could generate
a key pair for each copy of client software and then both install it into the client software
upon installation and register that instance with the AS.</t>
        <t>Alternatively, it's possible for the AS to generate keys to be used with access tokens that
are separate from the keys used by the client instance to request tokens. In this method,
the AS would generate the asymmetric key pair or symmetric key and return the public key or key
reference to the client instance alongside the access
token itself. The means for the AS to return generated key values to the client instance
are out of scope, since GNAP does not allow the transmission of private or shared key
information within the protocol itself.</t>
        <t>Additionally, if the token is bound to a key other than the client instance's presented key, this
opens a possible attack surface for an attacker's AS to request an access token and then substitute
their own key material in the response to the client instance. The attacker's AS would need to
be able to use the same key as the client instance, but this setup would allow an attacker's AS
to make use of a compromised key within a system. This attack can be prevented by only binding
access tokens to the client instance's presented keys and by having client instances have a strong
association between which keys they expect to use and the AS they expect to use them on.
This attack is also only able to be propagated on client instances that talk to more than
one AS at runtime, which can be limited by the client software.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-key-rotation">
        <name>Key Rotation Policy</name>
        <t>When keys are rotated, there could be a delay in the propagation of that rotation to various components in the AS's ecosystem. The AS can define its own policy regarding the timeout of the previously bound key, either making it immediately obsolete or allowing for a limited grace period during which both the previously bound key and the current key can be used for signing requests. Such a grace period can be useful when there are multiple running copies of the client that are coordinated with each other. For example, the client software could be deployed as a cloud service with multiple orchestrated nodes. Each of these copies is deployed using the same key; therefore, all the nodes represent the same client instance to the AS. In such cases, it can be difficult, or even impossible, to update the keys on all these copies in the same instant.</t>

        <t>The need to accommodate such known delays in the system needs to be balanced with the risk of allowing an old key to still be used. Narrowly restricting the exposure opportunities for exploit at the AS in terms of time, place, and method makes exploit significantly more difficult, especially if the exception happens only once. For example, the AS can reject requests from the previously bound key (or any previous one before it) to cause rotation to a new key or at least ensure that the rotation happens in an idempotent way to the same new key.</t>

      <section anchor="security-polling">
        <name>Interaction Finish Modes and Polling</name>
        <t>During the interaction process, the client instance usually hands control of the user experience
over to another component, be it the system browser, another application, or some action
the RO is instructed to take on another device. By using an interaction finish
method, the client instance can be securely notified by the AS when the interaction is completed
and the next phase of the protocol should occur. This process includes information that the
client instance can use to validate the finish call from the AS and prevent some injection,
session hijacking, and phishing attacks.</t>
        <t>Some types of client deployment are unable to receive an interaction finish message.
Without an interaction finish method to notify it, the client instance will need to poll the
grant continuation API while waiting for the RO to approve or deny the request.
An attacker could take advantage of this situation by capturing the interaction start
parameters and phishing a legitimate user into authorizing the attacker's waiting
client instance, which would in turn have no way of associating the completed interaction
from the targeted user with the start of the request from the attacker.</t>
        <t>However, it is important to note that this pattern is practically indistinguishable
from some legitimate use cases. For example, a smart device emits a code for
the RO to enter on a separate device. The smart device has to poll
because the expected behavior is that the interaction will take place on the separate
device, without a way to return information to the original device's context.</t>
        <t>As such, developers need to weigh the risks of forgoing an interaction finish
method against the deployment capabilities of the client software and its
environment. Due to the increased security, an interaction finish method should
be employed whenever possible.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-sessions">
        <name>Session Management for Interaction Finish Methods</name>
        <t>When using an interaction finish method such as <tt>redirect</tt> or <tt>push</tt>, the client instance receives
an unsolicited inbound request from an unknown party over HTTPS. The client
instance needs to be able to successfully associate this incoming request with a specific pending
grant request being managed by the client instance. If the client instance is not careful and precise about
this, an attacker could associate their own session at the client instance with a stolen interaction
response. The means of preventing this vary by the type of client software and interaction methods in use.
Some common patterns are enumerated here.</t>
        <t>If the end user interacts with the client instance through a web browser and the <tt>redirect</tt>
interaction finish method is used, the client instance can ensure that the incoming HTTP request
from the finish method is presented in the same browser session that the grant request was
started in. This technique is particularly useful when the <tt>redirect</tt> interaction start mode
is used as well, since in many cases, the end user will follow the redirection with the
same browser that they are using to interact with the client instance.
The client instance can then store the relevant pending grant information in the
session, either in the browser storage directly (such as with a single-page application) or
in an associated session store on a backend server. In both cases, when the incoming request
reaches the client instance, the session information can be used to ensure that the same party
that started the request is present as the request finishes.</t>
        <t>Ensuring that the same party that started a request is present when that request finishes can
prevent phishing attacks, where an attacker starts a request at an honest client instance and
tricks an honest RO into authorizing it. For example, if an honest end user (that also acts as the
RO) wants to start a request through a client instance controlled by the attacker, the attacker can
start a request at an honest client instance and then redirect the honest end user to the
interaction URI from the attackers session with the honest client instance. If the honest end user
then fails to realize that they are not authorizing the attacker-controlled client instance (with which
it started its request) but instead the honest client instance when interacting with the AS, the attacker's
session with the honest client instance would be authorized. This would give the attacker access to
the honest end user's resources that the honest client instance is authorized to access. However,
if after the interaction, the AS redirects the honest end user back to the client instance whose
grant request the end user just authorized, the honest end user is redirected to the honest client
instance. The honest client instance can then detect that the end user is not the party that started the
request, since the request at the honest client instance was started by the
attacker. This detection can prevent the attack. This is related to the discussion in <xref target="security-impersonation"/>, because again
the attack can be prevented by the AS informing the user as much as possible about the client
instance that is to be authorized.</t>
        <t>If the end user does not interact with the client instance through a web browser or the interaction
start method does not use the same browser or device that the end user is interacting through
(such as the launch of a second device through a scannable code or presentation of a user code), the
client instance will not be able to strongly associate an incoming HTTP request with an established
session with the end user. This is also true when the <tt>push</tt> interaction finish method is used,
since the HTTP request comes directly from the interaction component of the AS. In these
circumstances, the client instance can at least ensure that the incoming HTTP
request can be uniquely associated with an ongoing grant request by making the interaction finish
callback URI unique for the grant when making the interaction request (<xref target="request-interact-finish"> </xref>).
Mobile applications and other client instances that generally serve only a single end user at a time
can use this unique incoming URL to differentiate between a legitimate incoming request and
an attacker's stolen request.</t>

      <section anchor="security-interact-hash">
        <name>Calculating Interaction Hash</name>
        <t>While the use of GNAP's signing mechanisms and token-protected grant API provides
significant security protections to the protocol, the interaction reference mechanism
is susceptible to monitoring, capture, and injection by an attacker. To combat this, GNAP
requires the calculation and verification of an interaction hash. A client instance
might be tempted to skip this step, but doing so leaves the client instance open to
injection and manipulation by an attacker that could lead to additional issues.</t>
        <t>The calculation of the interaction hash value provides defense in depth, allowing a client
instance to protect itself from spurious injection of interaction references when using an
interaction finish method. The AS is protected during this attack through the
continuation access token being bound to the expected interaction reference,
but without hash calculation, the attacker could cause the client to make an
HTTP request on command, which could itself be manipulated -- for example, by including

  If the client instance does not check the interaction hash, the client instance
  will be tricked into submitting the interaction reference to the AS. Here, the AS will
  reject the interaction request because it is presented against CT2 and not
  CT1 as expected. However, an attacker who has potentially injected CT1 as
  the value of CT2 would be able to continue the attack.</t>

      <section anchor="security-client-storage">
        <name>Storage of Information during Interaction and Continuation</name>
        <t>When starting an interactive grant request, a client application has a number of protocol elements
that it needs to manage, including nonces, references, keys, access tokens, and other elements.
During the interaction process, the client instance usually hands control of the user experience
over to another component, be it the system browser, another application, or some action
the RO is instructed to take on another device. In order for the client instance
to make its continuation call, it will need to recall all of these protocol elements at a future time. Usually,
this means the client instance will need to store these protocol elements in some retrievable
fashion.</t>
        <t>If the security protocol elements are stored on the end user's device, such as in browser
storage or in local application data stores, capture and exfiltration of this information could
allow an attacker to continue a pending transaction instead of the client instance. Client
software can make use of secure storage mechanisms, including hardware-based key and data
storage, to prevent such exfiltration.</t>
        <t>Note that in GNAP, the client instance has to choose its interaction finish URI prior to making
the first call to the AS. As such, the interaction finish URI will often have a unique identifier
for the ongoing request, allowing the client instance to access the correct portion of its
storage. Since this URI is passed to other parties and often used through a browser,
this URI should not contain any security-sensitive information that would be
valuable to an attacker, such as any token identifier, nonce, or user information. Instead, a
cryptographically random value is suggested, and that value should be used to index into
a secure session or storage mechanism.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-continuation">
        <name>Denial of Service (DoS) through Grant Continuation</name>
        <t>When a client instance starts off an interactive process, it will eventually need to continue the grant
request in a subsequent message to the AS. It's possible for a naive client implementation to continuously
send continuation requests to the AS while waiting for approval, especially if no interaction
finish method is used. Such constant requests could overwhelm the AS's ability to respond to both
these and other requests.</t>
        <t>To mitigate this for well-behaved client software, the continuation response contains a <tt>wait</tt> parameter
that is intended to tell the client instance how long it should wait until making its next request.
This value can be used to back off client software that is checking too quickly by returning increasing
wait times for a single client instance.</t>
        <t>If client software ignores the <tt>wait</tt> value and makes its continuation calls too quickly or if the
client software assumes the absence of the <tt>wait</tt> values means it should poll immediately, the AS
can choose to return errors to the offending client instance, including possibly canceling the
ongoing grant request. With well-meaning client software, these errors can indicate a need to change
the client software's programmed behavior.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-random-exhaustion">
        <name>Exhaustion of Random Value Space</name>
        <t>Several parts of the GNAP process make use of unguessable randomized values, such as nonces,
tokens, user codes, and randomized URIs. Since these values are intended to be unique, a sufficiently
powerful attacker could make a large number of requests to trigger generation of randomized
values in an attempt to exhaust the random number generation space. While this attack is
particularly applicable to the AS, client software could likewise be targeted by an attacker
triggering new grant requests against an AS.</t>
        <t>To mitigate this, software can ensure that its random values are chosen from a significantly
large pool so that exhaustion of that pool is prohibitive for an attacker. Additionally, the
random values can be time-boxed in such a way that their validity windows are reasonably short.
Since many of the random values used within GNAP are used within limited portions of the protocol,
it is reasonable for a particular random value to be valid for only a small amount of time.
For example, the nonces used for interaction finish hash calculation need only to be valid while
the client instance is waiting for the finish callback and can be functionally expired
when the interaction has completed. Similarly, artifacts like access tokens and the interaction
reference can be limited to have lifetimes tied to their functional utility. Finally, each
different category of artifact (nonce, token, reference, identifier, etc.) can be
generated from a separate random pool of values instead of a single global value space.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-front-channel">
        <name>Front-Channel URIs</name>
        <t>Some interaction methods in GNAP make use of URIs accessed through the end user's browser,
known collectively as front-channel communication. These URIs are most notably present in
the <tt>redirect</tt> interaction <tt>start</tt> method and the <tt>redirect</tt> interaction <tt>finish</tt> mode. Since
these URIs are intended to be given to the end user, the end user and their browser will be
subjected to anything hosted at that URI including viruses, malware, and phishing scams. This
kind of risk is inherent to all redirection-based protocols, including GNAP, when used in this way.</t>
        <t>When talking to a new or unknown AS, a client instance might want to check the URI from the
interaction <tt>start</tt> against a blocklist and warn the end user before redirecting them. Many
client instances will provide an interstitial message prior to redirection in order to prepare
the user for control of the user experience being handed to the domain of the AS, and such a
method could be used to warn the user of potential threats (for instance, a rogue AS impersonating
a well-known service provider). Client software can also prevent this by managing an allowlist
of known and trusted ASes.</t>
        <t>Alternatively, an attacker could start a GNAP request with a known and trusted AS but include
their own attack site URI as the callback for the redirect <tt>finish</tt> method. The attacker would then send
the interaction <tt>start</tt> URI to the victim and get them to click on it. Since the URI is at
the known AS, the victim is inclined to do so. The victim will then be prompted to approve the
attacker's application, and in most circumstances, the victim will then be redirected to the
attacker's site whether or not the user approved the request. The AS could mitigate this partially
by using a blocklist and allowlist of interaction <tt>finish</tt> URIs during the client instance's
initial request, but this approach can be  especially difficult if the URI has any dynamic portion
chosen by the client software. The AS can couple these checks with policies associated with the
client instance that has been authenticated in the request. If the AS has any doubt about the
interaction finish URI, the AS can provide an interstitial warning to the end user before
processing the redirect.</t>
        <t>Ultimately, all protocols that use redirect-based communication through the user's browser are
susceptible to having an attacker try to co-opt one or more of those URIs in order to harm the
user. It is the responsibility of the AS and the client software to provide appropriate warnings,
education, and mitigation to protect end users.</t>

      <section anchor="security-assertions">
        <name>Processing Assertions</name>
        <t>Identity assertions can be used in GNAP to convey subject information, both from the AS to the
client instance in a response (<xref target="response-subject"> </xref>) and from the client instance to the AS in
a request (<xref target="request-subject"> </xref>). In both of these circumstances, when an assertion is passed in
GNAP, the receiver of the assertion needs to parse and process the assertion. As assertions are
complex artifacts with their own syntax and security, special care needs to be taken to prevent the
assertion values from being used as an attack vector.</t>
        <t>All assertion processing needs to account for the security aspects of the assertion format in
use. In particular, the processor needs to parse the assertion from a JSON string object
and apply the appropriate cryptographic processes to ensure the integrity of the assertion.</t>

<t>For example, when SAML 2.0 assertions are used, the receiver has to parse an XML document. There are
many well-known security vulnerabilities in XML parsers, and the XML standard itself can be
attacked through the use of processing instructions and entity expansions to cause problems
with the processor. Therefore, any system capable of processing SAML 2.0 assertions also needs to
have a secure and correct XML parser. In addition to this, the SAML 2.0 specification uses XML
Signatures, which have their own implementation problems that need to be accounted for. Similar
requirements exist for OpenID Connect ID Token, which is based on the JWT format
and the related JOSE cryptography suite.</t>

      <section anchor="security-cuckoo">
        <name>Stolen Token Replay</name>
        <t>If a client instance can request tokens at multiple ASes and the client instance uses the same keys
to make its requests across those different ASes, then it is possible for an attacker to replay a
stolen token issued by an honest AS from a compromised AS, thereby binding the stolen token to
the client instance's key in a different context. The attacker can manipulate the client instance
into using the stolen token at an RS, particularly at an RS that is expecting a token from the
honest AS. Since the honest AS issued the token and the client instance presents the token with
its expected bound key, the attack succeeds.</t>
        <t>This attack has several preconditions. In this attack, the attacker does not need access to the
client instance's key and cannot use the stolen token directly at the RS, but the attacker is able
to get the access token value in some fashion. The client instance also needs to be configured to
talk to multiple ASes, including the attacker's controlled AS. Finally, the client instance needs
to be able to be manipulated by the attacker to call the RS while using a token issued from the
stolen AS. The RS does not need to be compromised or made to trust the attacker's AS.</t>
        <t>To protect against this attack, the client instance can use a different key for each AS that it
talks to. Since the replayed token will be bound to the key used at the honest AS, the
uncompromised RS will reject the call since the client instance will be using the key used at
the attacker's AS instead with the same token.
When the MTLS key proofing method is used, a client instance can use self-signed
certificates to use a different key for each AS that it talks to, as discussed in
<xref target="security-mtls-patterns"/>.</t>
        <t>Additionally, the client instance can keep a strong association between the RS and a specific AS
that it trusts to issue tokens for that RS. This strong binding also helps against some forms of
AS mix-up attacks (<xref target="security-mixup"> </xref>). Managing this binding is outside the scope of this specification,
but it can be managed either as a configuration element for the client instance or dynamically
through discovering the AS from the RS (<xref target="rs-request-without-token"> </xref>).</t>


        <t>The details of this attack, with additional discussion and considerations, are available in Section 3.2 of <xref target="HELMSCHMIDT2022"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-stateless-tokens">
        <name>Self-Contained Stateless Access Tokens</name>
        <t>The contents and format of the access token are at the discretion of the AS and are opaque
to the client instance within GNAP. As discussed in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-gnap-resource-servers"/>, the AS and RS can make use of stateless access tokens
with an internal structure and format. These access tokens allow an RS to validate the token without
having to make any external calls at runtime, allowing for benefits in some deployments, the
discussion of which is outside the scope of this specification.</t>
<t>However, the use of such self-contained access tokens has an effect on the ability of the AS to
provide certain functionality defined within this specification. Specifically, since the access
token is self-contained, it is difficult or impossible for an AS to signal to all RSs within an
ecosystem when a specific access token has been revoked. Therefore, an AS in such an ecosystem
should probably not offer token revocation functionality to client instances, since the client
instance's calls to such an endpoint are effectively meaningless. However, a client instance calling
the token revocation function will also throw out its copy of the token, so such a placebo endpoint
might not be completely meaningless. Token rotation is similarly difficult because the AS has to
revoke the old access token after a rotation call has been made. If the access tokens are
completely self-contained and non-revocable, this means that there will be a period of time during
which both the old and new access tokens are valid and usable, which is an increased security risk
for the environment.</t>
        <t>These problems can be mitigated by keeping the validity time windows of self-contained access tokens
reasonably short, limiting the time after a revocation event that a revoked token could be used.
Additionally, the AS could proactively signal to RSs under its control identifiers for revoked
tokens that have yet to expire. This type of information push would be expected to be relatively
small and infrequent, and its implementation is outside the scope of this specification.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-network-management">
        <name>Network Problems and Token and Grant Management</name>
        <t>If a client instance makes a call to rotate an access token but the network connection is dropped
before the client instance receives the response with the new access token, the system as a whole
can end up in an inconsistent state, where the AS has already rotated the old access token and
invalidated it, but the client instance only has access to the invalidated access token and not the
newly rotated token value. If the client instance retries the rotation request, it would fail
because the client is no longer presenting a valid and current access token. A similar situation
can occur during grant continuation, where the same client instance calls to continue or update
a grant request without successfully receiving the results of the update.</t>
        <t>To combat this, both
grant management (<xref target="continue-request"> </xref>) and token management (<xref target="token-management"> </xref>) can be designed to be
idempotent, where subsequent calls to the same function with the same credentials are meant to
produce the same results. For example, multiple calls to rotate the same access token need to
result in the same rotated token value, within a reasonable time window.</t>
        <t>In practice, an AS can hold onto an old token value for such limited purposes. For example, to
support rotating access tokens over unreliable networks, the AS receives the initial request to
rotate an access token and creates a new token value and returns it. The AS also marks the old
token value as having been used to create the newly rotated token value. If the AS sees the old
token value within a small enough time window, such as a few seconds since the first rotation
attempt, the AS can return the same rotated access token value. Furthermore, once the system has seen the
newly rotated token in use, the original token can be discarded because the client instance has
proved that it did receive the token. The result of this is a system that is
eventually self-consistent without placing an undue complexity burden on the client instance
to manage problematic networks.</t>

      <section anchor="security-ssrf">
        <name>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</name>
        <t>There are several places within GNAP where a URI can be given to a party, causing it to fetch that
URI during normal operation of the protocol. If an attacker is able to control the value of one of
these URIs within the protocol, the attacker could cause the target system to execute a request on
a URI that is within reach of the target system but normally unavailable to the attacker. 
Examples include an attacker sending a URL of <tt>http://localhost/admin</tt> to cause the server to access an
internal function on itself or <tt>https://192.168.0.14/</tt> to call a service behind a firewall.
Even if the attacker does not gain access to the results of the call, the side effects of such
requests coming from a trusted host can be problematic to the security and sanctity of such
otherwise unexposed endpoints. This can be particularly problematic if such a URI is used to
call non-HTTP endpoints, such as remote code execution services local to the AS.</t>
        <t>The most vulnerable place in this specification is the
push-based post-interaction finish method (<xref target="interaction-pushback"> </xref>), as the client instance is
less trusted than the AS and can use this method to make the AS call an arbitrary URI. While it is
not required by the protocol, the AS can fetch other URIs provided by the client instance, such as the logo
image or home page, for verification or privacy-preserving purposes before displaying them to the
RO as part of a consent screen. Even if the AS does not fetch these URIs, their use in
GNAP's normal operation could cause an attack against the end user's browser as it fetches these
same attack URIs. Furthermore, extensions to GNAP that allow or require
URI fetch could also be similarly susceptible, such as a system for having the AS fetch a client
instance's keys from a presented URI instead of the client instance presenting the key by value.
Such extensions are outside the scope of this specification, but any system deploying such an
extension would need to be aware of this issue.</t>

<t>To help mitigate this problem, similar approaches that protect parties against
malicious redirects (<xref target="security-front-channel"> </xref>) can be used. For example, all URIs that can result
in a direct request being made by a party in the protocol can be filtered through an allowlist or
blocklist. For example, an AS that supports the <tt>push</tt>-based interaction <tt>finish</tt> method can compare the
callback URI in the interaction request to a known URI for a pre-registered client instance, or it
can ensure that the URI is not on a blocklist of sensitive URLs such as internal network addresses.
However, note that because these types of calls happen outside of the view of human interaction,
it is not usually feasible to provide notification and warning to someone before the request
needs to be executed, as is the case with redirection URLs. As such, SSRF is somewhat more difficult
to manage at runtime, and systems should generally refuse to fetch a URI if unsure.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-multiple-key-formats">
        <name>Multiple Key Formats</name>

	<t>All keys presented by value are only allowed to be in a single format. While it would seem
beneficial to allow keys to be sent in multiple formats in case the receiver doesn't understand
one or more of the formats used, there are security issues with such a feature.
If multiple keys formats are allowed,
receivers of these key definitions would need to be able to make sure that it's the same
key represented in each field and not simply use one of the key formats without checking for
equivalence. If equivalence is not carefully checked, it is possible for an attacker to insert
their own key into one of the formats without needing to have control over the other formats. This
could potentially lead to a situation where one key is used by part of the system (such as
identifying the client instance) and a different key in a different format in the same message is
used for other things (such as calculating signature validity). However, in such cases, it is
impossible for the receiver to ensure that all formats contain the same key information since it is
assumed that the receiver cannot understand all of the formats.</t>
        <t>To combat this, all keys presented by value have to be in exactly one supported format known
by the receiver as discussed in <xref target="key-format"/>. In most cases, a client instance is going to be configured with its keys in a
single format, and it will simply present that format as is to the AS in its request. A client
instance capable of multiple formats can use AS discovery (<xref target="discovery"> </xref>) to determine which formats
are supported, if desired. An AS should be generous in supporting many different key formats to
allow different types of client software and client instance deployments. An AS implementation
should try to support multiple formats to allow a variety of client software to connect.</t>

      <section anchor="security-async">
        <name>Asynchronous Interactions</name>
        <t>GNAP allows the RO to be contacted by the AS asynchronously, outside the regular flow of the
protocol. This allows for some advanced use cases, such as cross-user authentication or information
release, but such advanced use cases have some distinct issues that implementors need to be fully
aware of before using these features.</t>
        <t>First, in many applications, the return of subject information to the client instance could
indicate to the client instance that the end user is the party represented by that information,
functionally allowing the end user to authenticate to the client application. While the details of
a fully functional authentication protocol are outside the scope of GNAP, it is a common
exercise for a client instance to request information about the end user. This is facilitated
by several interaction methods (<xref target="interaction-start"> </xref>) defined in GNAP that allow the end user
to begin interaction directly with the AS. However, when the subject of the information is
intentionally not the end user, the client application will need some way to differentiate between
requests for authentication of the end user and requests for information about a different user.
Confusing these states could lead to an attacker having their account associated with a privileged
user. Client instances can mitigate this by having distinct code paths for primary end-user
authentication and for requesting subject information about secondary users, such as in a call center.
In such use cases, the client software used by the RO (the caller) and the end user
(the agent) are generally distinct, allowing the AS to differentiate between the agent's corporate device
making the request and the caller's personal device approving the request.</t>
        <t>Second, ROs that interact asynchronously do not usually have the same context as an end user in an
application attempting to perform the task needing authorization. As such, the asynchronous requests
for authorization coming to the RO from the AS might have very little to do with what the RO is
doing at the time. This situation can consequently lead to authorization fatigue on the part of the
RO, where any incoming authorization request is quickly approved and dispatched without the RO
making a proper verification of the request. An attacker can exploit this fatigue and get the RO
to authorize the attacker's system for access. To mitigate this, AS systems deploying asynchronous
authorization should only prompt the RO when the RO is expecting such a request, and significant
user experience engineering efforts need to be employed to ensure that the RO can clearly make the
appropriate security decision. Furthermore, audit capability and the ability to undo access
decisions that may be ongoing are particularly important in the asynchronous case.</t>

        <t>An attacker may aim to gain access to confidential or sensitive resources. The measures for hardening and monitoring RS systems (beyond protection with access tokens) are out of the scope of this document, but the use of GNAP to protect a system does not absolve the RS of following best practices.
GNAP generally considers that a breach can occur and therefore advises to prefer key-bound tokens whenever possible, which at least limits the impact of access token leakage by a compromised or malicious RS.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security-as-keys">
        <name>AS-Provided Token Keys</name>
        <t>While the most common token-issuance pattern is to bind the access token to the client instance's
presented key, it is possible for the AS to provide a binding key along with an access token, as
shown by the <tt>key</tt> field of the token response in <xref target="response-token-single"/>. This practice allows
for an AS to generate and manage the keys associated with tokens independently of the keys known
to client instances.</t>
        <t>If the key material is returned by value from the AS, then the client instance will simply use this
key value when presenting the token. This can be exploited by an attacker to issue a compromised token
to an unsuspecting client, assuming that the client instance trusts the attacker's AS to issue tokens
for the target RS. In this attack, the attacker first gets a token bound to a key under the attacker's
control. This token is likely bound to an authorization or account controlled by the attacker.
The attacker then reissues that same token to the client instance, this time acting as an AS. The attacker
can return their own key to the client instance, tricking the client instance into using the attacker's
token. Such an attack is also possible when the key is returned by reference, if the attacker
is able to provide a reference meaningful to the client instance that references a key under the attacker's
control. This substitution attack is similar to some of the main issues found with bearer tokens
as discussed in <xref target="security-bearer-tokens"/>.</t>

<t>Returning a key with an access token should be limited to circumstances where both the client and AS
can be verified to be honest and when the trade-off of not using a client instance's own keys
is worth the additional risk.</t>

        <t>GNAP assumes the TLS protection used throughout the spec is intact. Without the protection of TLS, there are many points throughout the use of GNAP that could lead to possible surveillance. Even with the proper use of TLS, surveillance could occur by several parties outside of the TLS-protected channels, as discussed in the subsections below.</t>

          <name>Surveillance by the Client</name>
          <t>The purpose of GNAP is to authorize clients to be able to access information on behalf of a user. So while it is expected that the client may be aware of the user's identity as well as data being fetched for that user, in some cases, the extent of the client may be beyond what the user is aware of. For example, a client may be implemented as multiple distinct pieces of software, such as a logging service or a mobile application that reports usage data to an external backend service. Each of these pieces could gain information about the user without the user being aware of this action.</t>
          <t>When the client software uses a hosted asset for its components, such as its logo image, the fetch of these assets can reveal user actions to the host. If the AS presents the logo URI to the RO in a browser page, the browser will fetch the logo URL from the authorization screen. This fetch will tell the host of the logo image that someone is accessing an instance of the client software and requesting access for it. This is particularly problematic when the host of the asset is not the client software itself, such as when a content delivery network is used.</t>

        <t>The RS is not required to store any state for its normal operation, as far as its part in implementing GNAP. Depending on the implementation of access tokens, the RS may need to cache public keys from the AS in order to validate access tokens.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="intrusion">
        <name>Intrusion</name>
        <t>Intrusion refers to the ability of various parties to send unsolicited messages or cause denial of service for unrelated parties.</t>
        <t>If the RO is different from the end user, there is an opportunity for the end user to cause unsolicited messages to be sent to the RO if the system prompts the RO for consent when an end user attempts to access their data.</t>
        <t>The format and contents of Subject Identifiers are intentionally not defined by GNAP. If the AS uses values for Subject Identifiers that are also identifiers for communication channels (e.g., an email address or phone number), this opens up the possibility for a client to learn this information when it was not otherwise authorized to access this kind of data about the user.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="correlation">
        <name>Correlation</name>
        <t>The threat of correlation is the combination of various pieces of information related to an individual in a way that defies their expectations of what others know about them.</t>
        <section anchor="privacy-correlation-client">
          <name>Correlation by Clients</name>
          <t>The biggest risk of correlation in GNAP is when an AS returns stable, consistent user identifiers to multiple different applications. In this case, applications created by different parties would be able to correlate these user identifiers out of band in order to know which users they have in common.</t>
          <t>The most common example of this in practice is tracking for advertising purposes, such that a client shares their list of user IDs with an ad platform that is then able to retarget ads to applications created by other parties. In contrast, a positive example of correlation is a corporate acquisition where two previously unrelated clients now do need to be able to identify the same user between the two clients, such as when software systems are intentionally connected by the end user.</t>
          <t>Another means of correlation comes from the use of RS-first discovery (<xref target="rs-request-without-token"> </xref>). A client instance that knows nothing other than an RS's URL could make an unauthenticated call to the RS and learn which AS protects the resources there. If the client instance knows something about the AS, such as it being a single-user AS or belonging to a specific organization, the client instance could, through association, learn things about the resource without ever gaining access to the resource itself.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="correlation-by-resource-servers">
          <name>Correlation by Resource Servers</name>
          <t>Unrelated RSs also have an opportunity to correlate users if the AS includes stable user identifiers in access tokens or in access token introspection responses.</t>
          <t>In some cases, an RS may not actually need to be able to identify users (such as an RS providing access to a company cafeteria menu, which only needs to validate whether the user is a current employee), so ASes should be thoughtful of when user identifiers are actually necessary to communicate to RSs for the functioning of the system.</t>
	  <t>However, note that the lack of inclusion of a user identifier in an access token may be a risk if there is a concern that two users may voluntarily share access tokens between them in order to access protected resources. For example, if a website wants to limit access to only people over 18, and such does not need to know any user identifiers, an access token may be issued by an AS contains only the claim "over 18". If the user is aware that this access token doesn't reference them individually, they may be willing to share the access token with a user who is under 18 in order to let them get access to the website. (Note that the binding of an access token to a non-extractable client instance key also prevents the access token from being voluntarily shared.)</t>

        <section anchor="correlation-by-authorization-servers">
          <name>Correlation by Authorization Servers</name>
          <t>Clients are expected to be identified by their client instance key. If a particular client instance key is used at more than one AS, this could open up the possibility for multiple unrelated ASes to correlate client instances. This is especially a problem in the common case where a client instance is used by a single individual, as it would allow the ASes to correlate that individual between them. If this is a concern of a client, the client should use distinct keys with each AS.</t>

        <name>Disclosure in Shared References</name>
        <t>Throughout many parts of GNAP, the parties pass shared references between each other, sometimes in place of the values themselves (for example, the <tt>interact_ref</tt> value used throughout the flow). These references are intended to be random strings and should not contain any private or sensitive data that could potentially leak information between parties.</t>

    <section anchor="vs-oauth2">
      <name>Comparison with OAuth 2.0</name>
      <t>GNAP's protocol design differs from OAuth 2.0's in several fundamental ways:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t><strong>Consent and authorization flexibility:</strong>  </t>
          <t>
OAuth 2.0 generally assumes the user has access to a web browser. The type of interaction available is fixed by the grant type, and the most common interactive grant types start in the browser. OAuth 2.0 assumes that the user using the client software is the same user that will interact with the AS to approve access.  </t>
          <t>
GNAP allows various patterns to manage authorizations and consents required to fulfill this requested delegation, including information sent by the client instance, information supplied by external parties, and information gathered through the interaction process. GNAP allows a client instance to list different ways that it can start and finish an interaction, and these can be mixed together as needed for different use cases. GNAP interactions can use a browser, but they don't have to. Methods can use inter-application messaging protocols, out-of-band data transfer, or anything else. GNAP allows extensions to define new ways to start and finish an interaction, as new methods and platforms are expected to become available over time. GNAP is designed to allow the end user and the RO to be two different people, but it still works in the optimized case of them being the same party.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t><strong>Intent registration and inline negotiation:</strong>  </t>
          <t>
OAuth 2.0 uses different "grant types" that start at different endpoints for different purposes. Many of these require discovery of several interrelated parameters.  </t>
          <t>
GNAP requests all start with the same type of request to the same endpoint at the AS. Next steps are negotiated between the client instance and AS based on software capabilities, policies surrounding requested access, and the overall context of the ongoing request. GNAP defines a continuation API that allows the client instance and AS to request and send additional information from each other over multiple steps. This continuation API uses the same access token protection that other GNAP-protected APIs use. GNAP allows discovery to optimize the requests, but it isn't required thanks to the negotiation capabilities.  </t>
          <t>
GNAP is able to handle the life cycle of an authorization request and therefore simplifies the mental model surrounding OAuth2. For instance, there's no need for refresh tokens when the API enables proper rotation of access tokens.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t><strong>Client instances:</strong>  </t>
          <t>
OAuth 2.0 requires all clients to be registered at the AS and to use a client_id known to the AS as part of the protocol. This client_id is generally assumed to be assigned by a trusted authority during a registration process, and OAuth places a lot of trust on the client_id as a result. Dynamic registration allows different classes of clients to get a client_id at runtime, even if they only ever use it for one request.  </t>
          <t>
GNAP allows the client instance to present an unknown key to the AS and use that key to protect the ongoing request. GNAP's client instance identifier mechanism allows for pre-registered clients and dynamically registered clients to exist as an optimized case without requiring the identifier as part of the protocol at all times.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t><strong>Expanded delegation:</strong>  </t>
          <t>
	    OAuth 2.0 defines the "scope" parameter for controlling access to APIs.
 This parameter has been coopted to mean a number of
 different things in different protocols, including flags for
 turning special behavior on and off and the return of data
 apart from the access token.  
	  The "resource" indicator (defined in <xref target="RFC8707"/>) and Rich Authorization Request (RAR) extensions (as defined in <xref target="RFC9396"/>) expand on the "scope" concept in similar but different ways.  </t>
          <t>
GNAP defines a rich structure for requesting access (analogous to RAR), with string references as an optimization (analogous to scopes). GNAP defines methods for requesting directly returned user information, separate from API access. This information includes identifiers for the current user and structured assertions. GNAP makes no assumptions or demands on the format or contents of the access token, but the RS extension allows a negotiation of token formats between the AS and RS.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t><strong>Cryptography-based security:</strong>  </t>
          <t>
OAuth 2.0 uses shared bearer secrets, including the client_secret and access token, and advanced authentication and sender constraints have been built on after the fact in inconsistent ways.  </t>
          <t>
In GNAP, all communication between the client instance and AS is bound to a key held by the client instance. GNAP uses the same cryptographic mechanisms for both authenticating the client (to the AS) and binding the access token (to the RS and the AS). GNAP allows extensions to define new cryptographic protection mechanisms, as new methods are expected to become available over time. GNAP does not have the notion of "public clients" because key information can always be sent and used dynamically.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t><strong>Privacy and usable security:</strong>  </t>
          <t>
OAuth 2.0's deployment model assumes a strong binding between the AS and the RS.  </t>
          <t>
GNAP is designed to be interoperable with decentralized identity standards and to provide a human-centric authorization layer. In addition to this specification, GNAP supports various patterns of communication between RSs and ASes through extensions. GNAP tries to limit the odds of a consolidation to just a handful of popular AS services.</t>

      <t>The protocol defined in this specification provides a number of
features that can be combined to solve many different kinds of
authentication scenarios. This section seeks to show examples of how the
protocol could be applied for different situations.</t>
      <t>Some longer fields, particularly cryptographic information, have been

        <name>Redirect-Based User Interaction</name>
        <t>In this scenario, the user is the RO and has access to a web
browser, and the client instance can take front-channel callbacks on the same
device as the user. This combination is analogous to the OAuth 2.0
Authorization Code grant type.</t>
        <t>The client instance initiates the request to the AS. Here, the client instance
identifies itself using its public key.</t>

While this is a large problem in many systems, GNAP's back-and-forth negotiation process
allows parties to declare at runtime everything that they support and then have the other party
select from that the subset of items that they also support, leading to functional compatibility
in many parts of the protocol even in an open world scenario.</t>
      <t>In addition, GNAP defines a set of interoperability profiles that gather together core requirements
to fix options into common configurations that are likely to be useful to large populations of
similar applications.</t>
      <t>Conformant AS implementations of these profiles <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> implement at least the features as specified
in the profile and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> implement additional features or profiles. Conformant client implementations
of these profiles <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> implement at least the features as specified, except where a subset of the
features allows the protocol to function (such as using polling instead of a push finish method for
the Secondary Device profile).</t>

      <name>Guidance for Extensions</name>
      <t>Extensions to this specification have a variety of places to alter the protocol, including many
fields and objects that can have additional values in a registry (<xref target="IANA"> </xref>) established by this
specification. For interoperability and to preserve the security of the protocol, extensions should
register new values with IANA by following the specified mechanism. While it may technically be
possible to extend the protocol by adding elements to JSON objects that are not governed by an
IANA registry, a recipient may ignore such values but is also allowed to reject them.</t>
      <t>Most object fields in GNAP are specified with types, and those types can allow different but
related behavior. For example, the <tt>access</tt> array can include either strings or objects, as
discussed in <xref target="resource-access-rights"/>. The use of JSON polymorphism (<xref target="polymorphism"> </xref>)
within GNAP allows extensions to define new fields by not only choosing a new name but also by
using an existing name with a new type. However, the extension's definition
of a new type for a field needs to fit the same kind of item being extended. For example, a
hypothetical extension could define a string value for the <tt>access_token</tt> request field,
with a URL to download a hosted access token request. Such an extension would be appropriate as
the <tt>access_token</tt> field still defines the access tokens being requested. However, if an extension
were to define a string value for the <tt>access_token</tt> request field, with the value instead
being something unrelated to the access token request such as a value or key format, this would
not be an appropriate means of extension. (Note that this specific extension example would create
another form of SSRF attack surface as discussed in <xref target="security-ssrf"/>.)</t>
      <t>As another example, both interaction start modes (<xref target="request-interact-start"> </xref>) and
key proofing methods (<xref target="binding-keys"> </xref>) can be defined as either strings or objects. An extension
could take a method defined as a string, such as <tt>app</tt>, and define an object-based version with
additional parameters. This extension should still define a method to launch an application on the
end user's device, just like <tt>app</tt> does when specified as a string.</t>
      <t>Additionally, the ability to deal with different types for a field is not expected to be equal
between an AS and client software, with the client software being assumed to be both more varied
and more simplified than the AS. Furthermore, the nature of the negotiation process in GNAP allows
the AS more chance of recovery from unknown situations and parameters. As such, any extensions that
change the type of any field returned to a client instance should only do so when the client
instance has indicated specific support for that extension through some kind of request parameter.</t>

    <section anchor="polymorphism">
      <name>JSON Structures and Polymorphism</name>
      <t>GNAP makes use of polymorphism within the <xref target="RFC8259">JSON</xref> structures used for
the protocol. Each portion of this protocol is defined in terms of the JSON data type
that its values can take, whether it's a string, object, array, boolean, or number. For some
fields, different data types offer different descriptive capabilities and are used in different
situations for the same field. Each data type provides a different syntax to express
the same underlying semantic protocol element, which allows for optimization and
simplification in many common cases.</t>
      <t>Even though JSON is often used to describe strongly typed structures, JSON on its own is naturally polymorphic.
In JSON, the named members of an object have no type associated with them, and any
data type can be used as the value for any member. In practice, each member
has a semantic type that needs to make sense to the parties creating and
consuming the object. Within this protocol, each object member is defined in terms
of its semantic content, and this semantic content might have expressions in
different concrete data types for different specific purposes. Since each object
member has exactly one value in JSON, each data type for an object member field
is naturally mutually exclusive with other data types within a single JSON object.</t>
      <t>For example, a resource request for a single access token is composed of an object
of resource request descriptions, while a request for multiple access tokens is
composed of an array whose member values are all objects. Both of these represent requests
for access, but the difference in syntax allows the client instance and AS to differentiate
between the two request types in the same request.</t>
      <t>Another form of polymorphism in JSON comes from the fact that the values within JSON
arrays need not all be of the same JSON data type. However, within this protocol,
each element within the array needs to be of the same kind of semantic element for
the collection to make sense, even when the data types are different from each other.</t>
      <t>For example, each aspect of a resource request can be described using an object with multiple
dimensional components, or the aspect can be requested using a string. In both cases, the resource
request is being described in a way that the AS needs to interpret, but with different
levels of specificity and complexity for the client instance to deal with. An API designer
can provide a set of common access scopes as simple strings but still allow
client software developers to specify custom access when needed for more complex APIs.</t>
      <t>Extensions to this specification can use different data types for defined fields, but
each extension needs to not only declare what the data type means but also provide
justification for the data type representing the same basic kind of thing it extends.
For example, an extension declaring an "array" representation for a field would need
to explain how the array represents something akin to the non-array element that it
is replacing. See additional discussion in <xref target="extensions"/>.</t>
