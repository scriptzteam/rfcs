    <abstract>
  
<t>The updates to RFC 5280 described in this document provide alignment
with the 2008 specification for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)
and includes support for internationalized email addresses in X.509
certificates.  The updates ensure that name constraints for 
email addresses that contain only ASCII characters and internationalized email addresses are handled in
the same manner.  This document obsoletes RFC 8399.</t>

<section anchor="intro">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document updates the Introduction in Section <xref target="RFC5280" section="1" sectionFormat="bare"/>, the Name Constraints
certificate extension discussion in Section <xref target="RFC5280" section="4.2.1.10" sectionFormat="bare"/>, and the Processing Rules
for Internationalized Names in Section <xref target="RFC5280" section="7" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 5280 <xref target="RFC5280"/> to provide
alignment with the 2008 specification for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)
and includes support for internationalized email addresses in X.509 certificates.</t>
      <t>An IDN in Unicode (native character) form contains at least one
U-label <xref target="RFC5890"/>.  IDNs are carried in certificates in ACE-encoded
form.  That is, all U-labels within an IDN are converted to A-labels.  Conversion
of a U-label to an A-label is described in <xref target="RFC5891"/>.</t>
      <t>The GeneralName structure supports many different name forms, including
otherName for extensibility.  RFC 8398 <xref target="RFC8398"/> specifies the
SmtpUTF8Mailbox for internationalized email addresses.</t>
      <t>Note that Internationalized Domain Names in Applications specifications
published in 2003 (IDNA2003) <xref target="RFC3490"/> and 2008 (IDNA2008) <xref target="RFC5890"/> both
refer to the Punycode algorithm for conversion <xref target="RFC3492"/>.</t>

      <t>Note that characters in the Unicode Category "Symbol, Other" (So) are
specifically not included in IDNA2003 <xref target="RFC3490"/> or IDNA2008 <xref target="RFC5890"/>;
the derived property values for characters in this category are calculated as
DISALLOWED.  Thus, some characters that are allowed under the Unicode IDNA
Compatibility Processing <xref target="UTS46"/> are not allowed under this specification.  
For instance, â™š.example, 
which contains the Unicode character U+1F0A1 (BLACK CHESS KING), 
results in a failure under this specification, but it becomes 
xn&nbhy;&nbhy;45h.example under <xref target="UTS46"/>.</t>

        <t>In some cases, <xref target="RFC8399"/> required conversion of A-labels to U-labels
in order to process name constraints for internationalized email
addresses.  This led to implementation complexity and at least two
security vulnerabilities.  One summary of the vulnerabilities can be
found in <xref target="DDHQ"/>.  Now, all IDNs
are carried and processed as A-labels.</t>
        <t>The Introduction provides a warning to implementers about the handling of
characters in the Unicode Category "Symbol, Other" (So), which includes
emoji characters.</t>

        <name>Update in IDNs in GeneralName (Section 7.2)</name>
        <t>This update aligns with IDNA2008.  Since all of <xref target="RFC5280" section="7.2" sectionFormat="of"/> is
replaced, the OLD text is not provided.</t>
        <t>NEW</t>
<blockquote>
<t>
   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) may be included in certificates
   and CRLs in the subjectAltName and issuerAltName extensions, name
   constraints extension, authority information access extension,
   subject information access extension, CRL distribution points
   extension, and issuing distribution point extension.  Each of these
   extensions uses the GeneralName type; one choice in GeneralName is
   the dNSName field, which is defined as type IA5String.</t>
<t>
   IA5String is limited to the set of ASCII characters.  To accommodate
   IDNs, U-labels are converted to A-labels.  The A-label is the
   encoding of the U-label according to the Punycode algorithm <xref target="RFC3492"/>
   with the ACE prefix "xn--" added at the beginning of the string.</t>
<t>
   When comparing DNS names for equality, conforming implementations
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform a case-insensitive exact match on the entire DNS name.
   When evaluating name constraints, conforming implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   perform a case-insensitive exact match on a label-by-label basis.  As
   noted in Section <xref target="RFC5280" section="4.2.1.10" sectionFormat="bare"/>, any DNS name that may be constructed by
   adding labels to the left-hand side of the domain name given as the
   constraint is considered to fall within the indicated subtree.</t>

<t>   Implementations that have a user interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> convert IDNs to
   Unicode for display.  Specifically, conforming implementations
   convert A-labels to U-labels for display purposes.</t>

<t>   Implementation consideration: There are increased memory requirements
   for IDNs.  An IDN ACE label will begin with the four additional
   characters "xn--", and an IDN can require as many as five ASCII
   characters to specify a single international character.</t>

<blockquote>
   Domain Names may also be represented as distinguished names using
   domain components in the subject field, the issuer field, the
   subjectAltName extension, or the issuerAltName extension.  As with
   the dNSName in the GeneralName type, the value of this attribute is
   defined as an IA5String.  Each domainComponent attribute represents a
   single label.  To represent a label from an IDN in the distinguished
   name, the implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform the "ToASCII" label conversion
   specified in Section 4.1 of RFC 3490.  The label <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be considered
   a "stored string".  That is, the AllowUnassigned flag <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> be
   set.

   the subjectAltName and issuerAltName extensions, name constraints
   extension, authority information access extension, subject
   information access extension, issuing distribution point extension,
   or CRL distribution points extension.  Each of these extensions uses
   the GeneralName construct.  If the email address includes an IDN but
   the local-part of the email address can be represented in ASCII, then
   the email address is placed in the rfc822Name choice of GeneralName,
   which is defined as type IA5String.  If the local-part of the
   internationalized email address cannot be represented in ASCII, then
   the internationalized email address is placed in the otherName choice
   of GeneralName using the conventions in RFC 8398 <xref target="RFC8398"/>.

<t>   7.5.2.  Local-Part Contains Non-ASCII Characters</t>

<t>   When the local-part contains non-ASCII characters, conforming

   SmtpUTF8Mailbox within the otherName choice of GeneralName as
   specified in Section <xref target="RFC8398" section="3" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 8398 <xref target="RFC8398"/>.  Note that the UTF8
   encoding of the internationalized email address <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain a
   Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) <xref target="RFC3629"/> to aid comparison.  The email address
   local-part within the SmtpUTF8Mailbox <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> conform to the
   requirements of <xref target="RFC6530"/> and <xref target="RFC6531"/>.</t>

<t>   Two email addresses are considered to match if:</t>
