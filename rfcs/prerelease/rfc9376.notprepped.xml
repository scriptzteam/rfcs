   This document examines the applicability of using existing GMPLS routing
   and signaling mechanisms to set up Optical Data Unit-k (ODUk) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) over Optical Data Unit-Cn (ODUCn) links as defined in
   the 2020 version of ITU-T Recommendation G.709.</t>

    <name>Introduction</name>
   <t>
   The current GMPLS routing <xref target="RFC7138" format="default"/>
   and signaling <xref target="RFC7139" format="default"/>
   extensions support the control of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) signals and capabilities that
   were defined in the 2012 version of ITU-T
   Recommendation G.709 <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2012" format="default"/>.</t>
  <t>
   In 2016, a new version of ITU-T
   Recommendation G.709 was published: <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2016" format="default"/>.
   This version introduced higher-rate Optical Transport Unit (OTU) and Optical Data Unit (ODU) signals, termed "OTUCn"
   and "ODUCn", respectively, which have a nominal rate of n*100 Gbit/s.
   According to the definition in <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2016" format="default"/>, OTUCn and ODUCn
   perform only the digital section-layer role, and ODUCn supports only ODUk clients.
   This document focuses on the use of existing GMPLS mechanisms to set
   up ODUk (e.g., ODUflex) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) over ODUCn links, independently from how
   these links have been set up.</t>

   <t>
   Because <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>
   does not introduce any new features to
   OTUCn and ODUCn compared to <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2016" format="default"/>, this document first presents an overview of the OTUCn and ODUCn signals in
   <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>
and then analyzes how the current GMPLS routing and signaling mechanisms can
be utilized to set up ODUk (e.g., ODUflex) LSPs over ODUCn links.
</t>

<t>
   This document assumes that readers are familiar with OTN, GMPLS, and how
   GMPLS is applied in OTN. As such, this document doesn't provide 
   any background pertaining to OTN that include links with capacities
   of 100 Gbit/s or less;  this background could be found in documents such as
   <xref target="RFC7062" format="default"/> and 
   <xref target="RFC7096" format="default"/>.
   This document provides an overview of the data plane primitives 
   that enable links with capacities greater than 100 Gbit/s and analyzes the extensions 
   that would be required in the current GMPLS routing and signaling mechanisms
   to support evolution in OTN.

<name>OTN Terminology Used in This Document</name>
<dl spacing="normal">
<dt>FlexO:</dt>
<dd>Flexible OTN information structure. This information structure usually
has a specific bitrate and frame format that consists of overhead and payload,
which are used as a group for the transport of an OTUCn signal.
</dd>
<dt>LSP:</dt>
<dd> Label Switched Path </dd>
<dt>MSI:</dt>
<dd>Multiplex Structure Indicator.  This structure indicates the
       grouping of the tributary slots in an OPU payload area that
       realizes a client signal, which is multiplexed into an OPU.  The
       individual clients multiplexed into the OPU payload area are
       distinguished by the Tributary Port Number (TPN).</dd>
<dt>ODU:</dt>
<dd>Optical Data Unit. An ODU has the frame structure and overhead, as defined in 
            Figure 12-1 of <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>. 
            ODUs can be formed in two ways: a) by encapsulating a single non-OTN client,
            such as SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) or Ethernet, or b) by multiplexing lower-rate ODUs.
            In general, the ODU layer represents the path layer in OTN. The only
            exception is the ODUCn signal (defined below), which is defined to be a section-layer signal.
            In the classification based on bitrates of the ODU signals, 
            ODUs are of two types: fixed rate and flexible rate. Flexible-rate
            ODUs, called "ODUflex", have a rate that is 239/238 times 
            the bitrate of the client signal they encapsulate. </dd>
<dt>ODUC:</dt>
<dd>Optical Data Unit-C. This signal has a bandwidth of approximately 100 Gbit/s and
is of a slightly higher bitrate than the fixed rate ODU4 signal.  This signal
has the format defined in Figure 12-1 of <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020"
format="default"/>.  This signal represents the building block for
constructing a higher-rate signal called "ODUCn" (defined below). </dd>

<dt>ODUCn:</dt>
<dd>Optical Data Unit-Cn, where Cn indicates the bitrate of approximately n*100 Gbit/s. 
           This frame structure consists of "n" interleaved frame and multiframe
           synchronous instances of the ODUC signal, each of which has the format defined in  
           Figure 12-1 of <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>.</dd>

<dt>ODUflex:</dt>
<dd>Optical Data Unit - flexible rate. An ODUflex has the same frame structure 
            as a "generic" ODU but with a rate that is a fixed multiple of the bitrate of the client signal it
            encapsulates. <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/> defines specific ODUflex containers that are required to transport
            specific clients such as 50GE, 200GE, 400GE, etc.</dd>

	    	    <dt>ODUk:</dt>
<dd>Optical Data Unit-k, where k is one of {0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 4}. The term "ODUk" refers
            to an ODU whose bitrate is fully specified by the index k. The bitrates of the
            ODUk signal for k = {0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 4} are approximately 1.25 Gbit/s, 2.5 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s,
            10.3 Gbit/s, 40 Gbit/s, and 100 Gbit/s, respectively.</dd>

<dt>OPUC:</dt>
<dd>Optical Payload Unit-C. This signal has a payload of approximately 100 Gbit/s. This
     structure represents the payload area of the ODUC signal. </dd>
<dt>OPUCn:</dt>
<dd>Optical Payload Unit-Cn, where Cn indicates that the bitrate is
approximately n*100 Gbit/s. This structure represents the payload area of the ODUCn
signal.</dd>
<dt>OTN:</dt>
<dd>Optical Transport Network</dd>
<dt>OTUC:</dt>
<dd>Optical Transport Unit-C. This signal has a bandwidth of approximately 100 Gbit/s.
    This signal forms the building block of the OTUCn signal defined below,
    which has a bandwidth of approximately n*100 Gbit/s. </dd>

<dt>OTUCn:</dt>
<dd>Fully standardized Optical Transport Unit-Cn. This frame structure is
           realized by extending the ODUCn signal with the OTU layer overhead.
           The structure of this signal is illustrated in Figure 11-4 of 
           <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>. Note that
           the term "fully standardized" is defined by ITU-T in Section 6.1.1 of
           <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>.</dd>
<dt>OTUCn-M:</dt>
<dd>This signal is an extension of the OTUCn signal introduced above.  This
signal contains the same amount of overhead as the OTUCn signal but contains a
reduced amount of payload area.  Specifically, the payload area consists of M
tributary slots (each 5 Gbit/s), where M is less than 20*n, which is the
number of tributary slots in the OTUCn signal.
</dd>
<dt>PSI:</dt>
<dd>Payload Structure Indicator.  This is a 256-byte signal
       that describes the composition of the OPU signal.  This field is
       a concatenation of the payload type (PT) and the Multiplex
       Structure Indicator (MSI) defined below.</dd>
<dt>TPN:</dt>
<dd>Tributary Port Number. The tributary port number is used to 
		indicate the port number of the client signal that is being 
		transported in one specific tributary slot. </dd>

<name>Overview of OTUCn/ODUCn in G.709</name>
<t>
   This section provides an overview of the OTUCn/ODUCn signals defined in
<xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>.
   The text in this section is purely descriptive
   and is not normative.  For a full description of OTUCn/ODUCn signals,
   please refer to <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>.

<t>
   In order to carry client signals with rates greater than 100 Gbit/s,
<xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>
  takes a general and scalable approach that
   decouples the rates of OTU signals from the client rate.  The new OTU
   signal is called "OTUCn", and this signal is defined to have a rate of
   (approximately) n*100 Gbit/s.  The following are the key characteristics of
   the OTUCn signal:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal">
<li>The OTUCn signal contains one ODUCn.  The OTUCn and ODUCn signals
       perform digital section-layer roles only (see Section 6.1.1 of
<xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>)
</li>
<li>The OTUCn signals are formed by interleaving n synchronous OTUC signals
(which are labeled 1, 2, ..., n).</li>
<li>Each of the OTUC instances has the same overhead as the standard
       OTUk signal in <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>.  
       Note that the OTUC signal doesn't include the Forward Error Correction (FEC) columns
       illustrated in Figure 11-1 of <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>.
       The OTUC signal includes an ODUC.</li>
<li>The OTUC signal has a slightly higher rate compared to the OTU4
       signal (without FEC); this is to ensure that the OPUC payload
       area can carry an ODU4 signal.</li>
<li> The combined signal OTUCn has n instances of OTUC overhead and 
       n instances of ODUC overhead.</li>
</ul>
<t>
   The OTUCn, ODUCn, and OPUCn signal structures are presented in a
   (physical) interface-independent manner, by means of n OTUC, ODUC, and
   OPUC instances that are marked #1 to #n.</t>
<t>
   OTUCn interfaces can be categorized as follows, based on the type of
   peer network element:</t>
   <dl spacing="normal">
     <dt>inter-domain interfaces:</dt><dd>These types of interfaces are used for
     connecting OTN edge nodes to (a) client equipment (e.g., routers)
     or (b) hand-off points from other OTN.  ITU-T
     Recommendation G709.1 <xref target="ITU-T_G709.1" format="default"/>
     specifies a flexible interoperable
     short-reach OTN interface over which an OTUCn (n &gt;=1) is
     transferred, using bonded Flexible OTN information structure (FlexO) interfaces, which belong to a
     FlexO group.</dd>
     <dt>intra-domain interfaces:</dt><dd>In these cases, the OTUCn is transported
     using a proprietary (vendor-specific) encapsulation, FEC, etc.  It
     is also possible to transport OTUCn for intra-domain links using
     FlexO.</dd>
   </dl>

<section anchor="sect-3.1.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
<name>OTUCn-M</name>
<t>
   The standard OTUCn signal has the same rate as the ODUCn signal.  This
   implies that the OTUCn signal can only be transported over wavelength
   groups that have a total capacity of multiples of (approximately) 100 Gbit/s.
   Modern optical interfaces support a variety of bitrates per wavelength,
   depending on the reach requirements for the optical path.  If the total
   rate of the ODUk LSPs planned to be carried over an ODUCn link is smaller
   than n*100 Gbit/s, it is possible to "crunch" the OTUCn, and the unused
   tributary slots are thus not transmitted.  <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020"
   format="default"/> supports the notion of a reduced-rate OTUCn signal,
   termed "OTUCn-M".  The OTUCn-M signal is derived from the OTUCn signal by
   retaining all the n instances of overhead (one per OTUC instance) but with
   only M (M is less than 20*n) OPUCn tributary slots available to carry ODUk
   LSPs.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="sect-3.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
<name>ODUCn</name>

<t>
   The ODUCn signal defined in <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>
   can be viewed as being
   formed by the appropriate interleaving of content from n ODUC signal
   instances.
   The ODUC frames have the same structure as a standard ODU
   in the sense that the frames have the same overhead and payload 
   areas but have a higher rate since their payload area can embed 
   an ODU4 signal.
</t>
   <t>
   The ODUCn is a multiplex section ODU signal and is mapped into an
   OTUCn signal, which provides the regenerator section layer.  In some
   scenarios, the ODUCn and OTUCn signals will be coterminated, i.e.,
   they will have identical source/sink locations (see 
   <xref target="ure-oducn-signal" format="default"/>). In <xref target="ure-oducn-signal" format="default"/>,
   the term "OTN Switch" has the same meaning as that used in
   <xref target="RFC7138" section="3" sectionFormat="of"/>.
   <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>
   allows for the ODUCn signal to pass through one or more digital regenerator
   nodes (shown as nodes B and C in <xref target="ure-oducn-signal-multihop" format="default"/>), 
   which will terminate the OTUCn layer but will pass the
   regenerated (but otherwise untouched) ODUCn towards a different OTUCn
   interface where a fresh OTUCn layer will be initiated. 
   This process is termed as "ODUCn regeneration" in Section 7.1 of
   <xref target="ITU-T_G872" format="default"/>.
   In this example, the ODUCn is carried by three OTUCn segments.
   </t>
<t>
   Specifically, the OPUCn signal flows through these regenerators
   unchanged.  That is, the set of client signals, their TPNs, and tributary-slot
   allocations remains unchanged.</t>

   slots in OPU2, OPU3, and OPU4 signals.  <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>
 defined the
   OPUC with a 5 Gbit/s tributary slot granularity.  This means that the ODUCn
   signal has 20*n tributary slots (of 5 Gbit/s capacity).  The range of
   tributary port number (TPN) is 10*n instead of 20*n, which restricts
   the maximum client signals that could be carried over one single

<name>Structure of OPUCn MSI with Payload Type 0x22</name>

   As mentioned above, the OPUCn signal has 20*n tributary slots (TSs) (each 5

   indicates the availability and occupation of each TS.  Two bytes are used
   for each of the 20*n tributary slots, and each such information structure

       <li>The tributary port number (14 bits) indicates the port number of
       the client signal that is being carried in this specific TS.  A
       flexible assignment of tributary port to tributary slots is possible.
       Numbering of tributary ports is from 1 to 10*n.

</section>
<section anchor="sect-3.5" numbered="true" toc="default">
<name>Client Signal Mappings</name>
<t>
   The approach taken by the ITU-T to map non-OTN client signals to the
   appropriate ODU containers is as follows:</t>
<ul spacing="normal">
<li>All client signals are mapped into an ODUj or ODUk (e.g., ODUflex) as
       specified in Section 17 of <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/>.</li>
<li> The terms "ODUj" and "ODUk" are used in a multiplexing scenario, with
   ODUj being a low-order ODU that is multiplexed into ODUk, a high-order ODU.
   As <xref target="ure-digital-structure-of-otn-interfaces-from-g.709figure-6-1"/> illustrates, 
   the ODUCn is also a high-order ODU into which other ODUs can be multiplexed. The ODUCn
   itself cannot be multiplexed into any higher-rate ODU signal; it is defined to be a 
   section-level signal. </li>
<li>ODUflex signals are low-order signals only.  If the ODUflex
       entities have rates of 100 Gbit/s or less, they can be transported over
       either an ODUk (k=1..4) or an ODUCn.  For ODUflex connections
       with rates greater than 100 Gbit/s, ODUCn is required.</li>
<li>ODU Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) has been deprecated.  This simplifies
       the network and the supporting hardware since multiple different
       mappings for the same client are no longer necessary.  Note that
       legacy implementations that transported sub-100 Gbit/s clients using
       ODU VCAT shall continue to be supported.</li>

<t>
   <xref target="RFC7138" section="3" sectionFormat="of"/> describes how to represent G.709 OTUk/ODUk with
   TE links in GMPLS.  In the same manner, OTUCn links can also be represented as
   TE links.  <xref target="ure-oducn-te-links-1" format="default"/> provides an
   illustration of a one-hop OTUCn TE link.</t>

<t>
It is possible to create TE links that span more than one hop by creating
forward adjacencies (FAs) between non-adjacent nodes 
(see <xref target="ure-oducn-te-links-2" format="default"/>). In <xref target="ure-oducn-te-links-2" format="default"/>,
nodes B and C are performing the ODUCn regeneration
function described in Section 7.1 of <xref target="ITU-T_G872"/>
and are not electrically switching the ODUCn signal from one interface to another.
As in the one-hop case, multi-hop TE links advertise the ODU switching capability.</t>

<t>
   The two endpoints of a TE link are configured with the supported
   resource information (which may include whether the TE link is
   supported by an ODUCn, ODUk, or OTUk), as well as the link
   attribute information (e.g., slot granularity and list of available
   tributary slot).</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-4.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
<name>GMPLS Signaling</name>

<t>
   Once the ODUCn TE link is configured, the GMPLS mechanisms defined in
<xref target="RFC7139" format="default"/>
 can be reused to set up ODUk/ODUflex LSPs with no changes.
   As the resource on the ODUCn link that can be seen by the ODUk/ODUflex 
   client signal is a set of 5 Gbit/s slots, the label defined in
   <xref target="RFC7139" format="default"/>
is able to accommodate the requirement of the setup of an ODUk/ODUflex client
signal over an ODUCn link.  In <xref target="RFC7139" format="default"/>, the
OTN-TDM GENERALIZED_LABEL object is used to indicate how the lower-order (LO)
ODUj signal is multiplexed into the higher-order (HO) ODUk link.  In a similar
manner, the OTN-TDM GENERALIZED_LABEL object is used to indicate how the ODUk
signal is multiplexed into the ODUCn link.  The ODUk signal type is indicated
by Traffic Parameters.  The IF_ID RSVP_HOP object provides a pointer to the
interface associated with TE link; therefore, the two nodes terminating the
TE link know (by internal/local configuration) the attributes of the ODUCn TE
Link.</t>

<t>
   The TPN defined in <xref target="ITU-T_G709_2020" format="default"/> (where it is referred to as 
   "tributary port #")
   for an ODUCn link has 14
   bits while this field in <xref target="RFC7139" format="default"/>
   only has 12 bits, so some extension work will eventually be needed.
   Given that a 12-bit TPN field can support ODUCn
   links with up to n=400 (i.e., 40 Tbit/s links), this need is not urgent.</t>

<t>
   The example in <xref target="ure-label-format" format="default"/>
   illustrates the label format defined in <xref target="RFC7139"
   format="default"/> for multiplexing ODU4 onto ODUC10.  One ODUC10 has 200
   slots (each 5 Gbit/s), and twenty of them are allocated to the ODU4.  With
   this label encoding, only 20 out of the 200 bits mask are non-zero, which
   is very inefficient.  The inefficiency grows for larger values of "n", and
   an optimized label format may be desirable. </t>

<name>GMPLS Routing</name>

<t>
   For routing, it is deemed that no extension to the current mechanisms
   defined in <xref target="RFC7138" format="default"/>
   is needed.
</t>

<t>
The ODUCn link, which is the lowest layer of the ODU multiplexing hierarchy
involving multiple ODU layers, is assumed to have been already configured when
GMPLS is used to set up ODUk over ODUCn; therefore, the resources that need to
be advertised are the resources that are exposed by this ODUCn link and the
ODUk multiplexing hierarchy on it. The 5 Gbit/s OPUCn time slots do not need to
be advertised, while the 1.25 Gbit/s and 2.5 Gbit/s OPUk time slots need to be
advertised using the mechanisms already defined in <xref target="RFC7138"
format="default"/>.
</t>
<t>
    Since there is a 1:1 correspondence between the ODUCn and the OTUCn signal, there is no need to explicitly define a new value to represent the ODUCn signal type in the OSPF-TE routing protocol.

<name> Possible Future Work </name>
<t>
As noted in <xref target="sect-4.2" format="default"/>, 
the GMPLS TPN field defined in
<xref target="RFC7139" section="6.1" sectionFormat="of"/> is only 12 bits, whereas
an ODUCn link could require up to 14 bits. 
Although the need is not urgent, future work could extend the TPN field 
in GMPLS to use the Reserved bits immediately adjacent. 
This would need to be done in a backward-compatible way. </t>

<t>
<xref target="sect-4.2" format="default"/> further notes that the current encoding of 
GMPLS labels can be inefficient for larger values of n in ODUCn. 
Future work might examine a more compact, yet generalized, label encoding 
to address this issue should it be felt, after analysis of the operational 
aspects, that the current encoding is causing problems. 
Introduction of a new label encoding would need to be done using a 
new pairing of LSP encoding type and Generalized Payload Identifier (G-PID) to ensure correct interoperability.</t>
