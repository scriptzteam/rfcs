<t>Most HTTP authentication schemes are probeable in the sense that it is possible
for an unauthenticated client to probe whether an origin serves resources that
require authentication. It is possible for an origin to hide the fact that it
requires authentication by not generating Unauthorized status codes; however,
that only works with non-cryptographic authentication schemes: cryptographic
signatures require a fresh nonce to be signed. Prior to this document, there
was no existing way for the origin to share such a nonce without exposing the
fact that it serves resources that require authentication. This document
defines a new non-probeable cryptographic authentication scheme.</t>

<section anchor="introduction">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>HTTP authentication schemes (see <xref section="11" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9110"/>) allow origins
to restrict access for some resources to only authenticated requests. While
these schemes commonly involve a challenge where the origin asks the client to
provide authentication information, it is possible for clients to send such
information unprompted. This is particularly useful in cases where an origin
wants to offer a service or capability only to "those who know", while all
others are given no indication the service or capability exists. Such designs
rely on an externally defined mechanism by which keys are distributed. For
example, a company might offer remote employee access to company services
directly via its website using their employee credentials or offer access to
limited special capabilities for specific employees while making discovering
(or probing for) such capabilities difficult. As another example, members of
less well-defined communities might use more ephemeral keys to acquire access
to geography- or capability-specific resources, as issued by an entity whose
user base is larger than the available resources can support (by having that
entity metering the availability of keys temporally or geographically).</t>
      <t>While digital-signature-based HTTP authentication schemes already exist (e.g.,
<xref target="RFC7486"/>), they rely on the origin explicitly sending a fresh
challenge to the client, to ensure that the signature input is fresh. That
makes the origin probeable as it sends the challenge to unauthenticated
clients. This document defines a new signature-based authentication scheme that
is not probeable.</t>

      <name>The Concealed HTTP Authentication Scheme</name>
      <t>This document defines the "Concealed" HTTP authentication scheme. It uses
asymmetric cryptography. Clients possess a key ID and a public/private key
pair, and origin servers maintain a mapping of authorized key IDs to associated
public keys.</t>
      <t>The client uses a TLS keying material exporter to generate data to be signed
(see <xref target="client"/>) then sends the signature using the Authorization (or
Proxy-Authorization) header field (see <xref section="11" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9110"/>). The signature
and additional information are exchanged using authentication parameters (see
<xref target="auth-params"/>). Once the server receives these, it can check whether the
signature validates against an entry in its database of known keys. The server
can then use the validation result to influence its response to the client, for
example, by restricting access to certain resources.</t>

      <t>In most deployments, we expect both the frontend and backend roles to be

origin server.</t>

This trust relationship is common because the frontend already needs access to
the TLS certificate private key in order to respond to requests. HTTP servers
that parse the Concealed-Auth-Export header field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore it unless they
have already established that they trust the sender. Similarly, frontends that
send the Concealed-Auth-Export header field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that they do not
forward any Concealed-Auth-Export header field received from the client.</t>

        <name>Backend Handling</name>
        <t>Once the backend receives the Authorization (or Proxy-Authorization) header
field and the key exporter output, it looks up the key ID in its database of
public keys. The backend <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> then perform the following checks:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>validate that all the required authentication parameters are present and can
be parsed correctly as defined in <xref target="auth-params"/></t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>ensure the key ID is present in the backend's database and maps to a
corresponding public key</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>validate that the public key from the database is equal to the one in the
Authorization (or Proxy-Authorization) header field</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>validate that the verification field from the Authorization (or
Proxy-Authorization) header field matches the one extracted from the key
exporter output</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>verify the cryptographic signature as defined in <xref target="computation"/></t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>If all of these checks succeed, the backend can consider the request to be
properly authenticated and can reply accordingly (the backend can also forward
the request to another HTTP server).</t>
        <t>If any of the above checks fail, the backend <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat it as if the
Authorization (or Proxy-Authorization) header field was missing.</t>

      <section anchor="non-probeable-server-handling">
        <name>Non-Probeable Server Handling</name>
        <t>Servers that wish to introduce resources whose existence cannot be probed need
to ensure that they do not reveal any information about those resources to
unauthenticated clients. In particular, such servers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> respond to
authentication failures with the exact same response that they would have used
for nonexistent resources. For example, this can mean using HTTP status code
404 (Not Found) instead of 401 (Unauthorized).</t>
        <t>The authentication checks described above can take time to compute, and an
attacker could detect use of this mechanism if that time is observable by
comparing the timing of a request for a known nonexistent resource to the
timing of a request for a potentially authenticated resource. Servers can
mitigate this observability by slightly delaying responses to some nonexistent
resources such that the timing of the authentication verification is not
observable. This delay needs to be carefully considered to avoid having the
delay itself leak the fact that this origin uses this mechanism at all.</t>
        <t>Non-probeable resources also need to be non-discoverable for unauthenticated
users. For example, if a server operator wishes to hide an authenticated
resource by pretending it does not exist to unauthenticated users, then the
server operator needs to ensure there are no unauthenticated pages with links
to that resource and no other out-of-band ways for unauthenticated users to
discover this resource.</t>

    <section anchor="requirements-on-tls-usage">
      <name>Requirements on TLS Usage</name>
      <t>This authentication scheme is only defined for uses of HTTP with TLS
<xref target="RFC8446"/>. This includes any use of HTTP over TLS as typically used for
HTTP/2 <xref target="RFC9113"/>, or HTTP/3 <xref target="RFC9114"/> where the transport protocol uses TLS as its
authentication and key exchange mechanism <xref target="RFC9001"/>.</t>
      <t>Because the TLS keying material exporter is only secure for authentication when
it is uniquely bound to the TLS session <xref target="RFC7627"/>, the Concealed
authentication scheme requires either one of the following properties:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>The TLS version in use is greater than or equal to 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The TLS version in use is 1.2, and the extended master secret extension
<xref target="RFC7627"/> has been negotiated.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>Clients <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the Concealed HTTP authentication scheme on connections that do
not meet one of the two properties above. If a server receives a request that
uses this authentication scheme on a connection that meets neither of the above
properties, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat the request as if the authentication were not
present.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The Concealed HTTP authentication scheme allows a client to authenticate to an
origin server while guaranteeing freshness and without the need for the server
to transmit a nonce to the client. This allows the server to accept
authenticated clients without revealing that it supports or expects
authentication for some resources. It also allows authentication without the
client leaking the presence of authentication to observers due to cleartext
TLS Client Hello extensions.</t>
      <t>Since the freshness described above is provided by a TLS key exporter, it can
be as old as the underlying TLS connection. Servers can require better
freshness by forcing clients to create new connections using mechanisms such as
the GOAWAY frame (see <xref section="5.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9114"/>).</t>
      <t>The authentication proofs described in this document are not bound to
individual HTTP requests; if the key is used for authentication proofs on
multiple requests on the same connection, they will all be identical. This
allows for better compression when sending over the wire, but it implies that
client implementations that multiplex different security contexts over a single
HTTP connection need to ensure that those contexts cannot read each other's
header fields. Otherwise, one context would be able to replay the Authorization
header field of another. This constraint is met by modern web browsers. If an
attacker were to compromise the browser such that it could access another
context's memory, the attacker might also be able to access the corresponding
key, so binding authentication to requests would not provide much benefit in
practice.</t>
      <t>Authentication asymmetric keys used for the Concealed HTTP authentication
scheme <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be reused in other protocols. Even though we attempt to
mitigate these issues by adding a static prefix to the signed data (see
<xref target="computation"/>), reusing keys could undermine the security guarantees of the
authentication.</t>
      <t>Origins offering this scheme can link requests that use the same key.
However, requests are not linkable across origins if the keys used are specific
to the individual origins using this scheme.</t>
