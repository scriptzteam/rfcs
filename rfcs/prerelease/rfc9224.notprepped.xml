      <t>Querying and retrieving registration data from registries are defined
      in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) <xref target="RFC7480"
      format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7481" format="default"/> <xref
      target="RFC9082" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC9083"
      format="default"/>. These documents do not specify where to send the
      queries. This document specifies a method to find which server is
      authoritative to answer queries for the requested scope.</t>
      <t>Top-Level Domains (TLDs), Autonomous System (AS) numbers, and network
      blocks are delegated by IANA to Internet registries such as TLD
      registries and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that then issue
      further delegations and maintain information about them.  Thus, the
      bootstrap information needed by RDAP clients is best generated from data
      and processes already maintained by IANA; the relevant registries
      already exist at <xref target="ipv4reg" format="default"/>, <xref
      target="ipv6reg" format="default"/>, <xref target="asreg"
      format="default"/>, and <xref target="domainreg"
      format="default"/>. This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC7484"
      format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t>Per this document, IANA has created new registries based on a JSON
      format specified in this document, herein named RDAP Bootstrap Service
      Registries. These new registries are based on the existing entries of
      the above-mentioned registries. An RDAP client fetches the RDAP
      Bootstrap Service Registries, extracts the data, and then performs a
      match with the query data to find the authoritative registration data
      server and appropriate query base URL.

      <name>Structure of the RDAP Bootstrap Service Registries</name>
      <t>The RDAP Bootstrap Service Registries, as specified in <xref target="ianaconsiderations" format="default"/> below, have been made available as JSON <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/> objects, which can be retrieved via HTTP from locations specified by IANA. The JSON object for each registry contains a series of members containing metadata about the registry such as a version identifier, a timestamp of the publication date of the registry, and a description. Additionally, a "services" member contains the registry items themselves, as an array. Each item of the array contains a second-level array, with two elements, each of them being a third-level array.
      </t>

      <t>Each element of the Services Array is a second-level array with two elements: in order, an Entry Array and a Service URL Array.</t>
      <t>The Entry Array contains all entries that have the same set of base RDAP URLs.  The Service URL Array contains the list of base RDAP URLs usable for the entries found in the Entry Array. Elements within these two arrays are not ordered in any way.</t>
      <t>An example structure of the JSON output of an RDAP Bootstrap Service Registry is illustrated:

      <t>Per <xref target="RFC7258" format="default"/>, in each array of base RDAP URLs, the secure versions of the transport protocol <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be preferred and tried first.

      <t>Base RDAP URLs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have a trailing "/" character

      <t>The domain name's authoritative registration data service is found by
    doing the label-wise longest match of the target domain name with the
    domain values in the Entry Arrays in the IANA "Bootstrap Service Registry for
    Domain Name Space". The match is done per label, from right to left. If the longest match results in multiple entries, then those entries are considered equivalent. The values contained in the Service URL Array of the matching second-level array are the valid base RDAP URLs as described in <xref target="RFC9082" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>For example, a domain RDAP query for a.b.example.com matches the com entry in one of the arrays of the registry. The base RDAP URL for this query is then taken from the second element of the array, which is an array of base RDAP URLs valid for this entry. The client chooses one of the base URLs from this array; in this example, it chooses the only one available, "https://registry.example.com/myrdap/". The segment specified in <xref target="RFC9082" format="default"/> is then appended to the base URL to complete the query. The complete query is then "https://registry.example.com/myrdap/domain/a.b.example.com". </t>
      <t>If a domain RDAP query for a.b.example.com matches both com and example.com entries in the registry, then the longest match applies and the example.com entry is used by the client.</t>
      <t>If the registry contains entries such as com and goodexample.com, then a domain RDAP query for example.com only matches the com entry because matching is done on a per-label basis.</t>
      <t>The entry for the root of the domain name space is specified as "".</t>

      <t>This section discusses IPv4 and IPv6 address space and Autonomous System numbers.</t>
      <t>For IP address space, the authoritative registration data service is found
by doing a longest match of the target address with the values of the arrays
in the corresponding RDAP Bootstrap Service Registry for Address
Space. The longest match is done the same way as in packet forwarding: the addresses are converted in binary form and then the binary strings are compared to find the longest match up to the specified prefix length. The values contained in the second element of the array are the base RDAP URLs as described in <xref target="RFC9082" format="default"/>. The longest match method enables covering prefixes of a larger address space pointing to one base RDAP URL while more specific prefixes within the covering prefix are being served by another base RDAP URL.</t>

      <t>When a new object is allocated, such as a new AS range, a new TLD, or a new IP address range, there is no guarantee that this new object will have an entry in the corresponding bootstrap RDAP registry, since the setup of the RDAP server for this new entry may become live and registered later.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>By providing a bootstrap method to find RDAP servers, this document
     helps to ensure that the end users will get the RDAP data from an
     authoritative source instead of from rogue sources. The method has the
     same security properties as the RDAP protocols themselves. 

   The transport used to access the registries uses TLS <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>Additional considerations on using RDAP are described in <xref target="RFC7481" format="default"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ianaconsiderations" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>


      <t>IANA has created the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries listed below
 and made them available as JSON objects.  The contents of these registries are described in Sections <xref target="struct" format="counter"/>, <xref target="domainrdapreg" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="iprdapreg" format="counter"/>, with the formal syntax specified in <xref target="abnf" format="default"/>. The registries <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be accessible only through HTTPS (TLS <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>) transport.</t>
      <t>The process for adding or updating entries in these registries differs from the normal IANA registry processes: these registries are generated from the data, processes, and policies maintained by IANA in their allocation registries (<xref target="ipv4reg" format="default"/>, <xref target="ipv6reg" format="default"/>, <xref target="asreg" format="default"/>, and <xref target="domainreg" format="default"/>), with the addition of new RDAP server information.</t>
      <t>IANA updates RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries entries from the
      allocation registries as those registries are updated.</t>
      <t>This document does not change any policies related to the allocation
registries; IANA has provided a mechanism for collecting the RDAP server information.</t>

<t>IANA has created a new top-level category on the Protocol Registries page:
     <eref target="https://www.iana.org/protocols" brackets="angle"/>. The group is
called "Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)".

Each of the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries has been made available for
on-demand download in the JSON format by the general public, and that registry's URI
is listed directly on the Protocol Registries page.
</t>
      <t>Other normal registries will be added to this group by other
      documents, but the reason the URIs for these registries are clearly
      listed on the main page is to make those URIs obvious to implementers --
      these are registries that will be accessed by software, as well as by
      humans using them for reference information.</t>
      <t>Because these registries will be accessed by software, the download demand
for the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries may be unusually high compared to
normal IANA registries.  The technical infrastructure by which registries are
published has been put in place by IANA to support the load. Since the publication of  <xref target="RFC7484" format="default"/>, no issues have been reported regarding the load or the service. </t>
      <t>As discussed in <xref target="deploy" format="default"/>, software that accesses these registries will depend on the HTTP Expires header field to limit their query rate. It is, therefore, important for that header field to be properly set to provide timely information as the registries change, while maintaining a reasonable load on the IANA servers.</t>
      <t>The HTTP Content-Type returned to clients accessing these JSON-formatted registries <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be "application/json", as defined in <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Because of how information in the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries is grouped and formatted, the registry entries may not be sortable.  It is, therefore, not required or expected that the entries be ordered in any way.</t>
