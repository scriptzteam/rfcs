        This document specifies YANG modules for representing assurance graphs.
        These graphs represent the assurance of a given service by decomposing it into atomic assurance elements called subservices.
        The companion document, "Service Assurance for Intent-Based Networking Architecture" (RFC 9417), presents an architecture for implementing the assurance of such services.

      <t>
        The main YANG module,  "ietf-service-assurance" (<xref target="main-module" format="default"/>), defines objects for assuring network services based on their decomposition into so-called subservices.
        The subservices are hierarchically organized by dependencies.
        The subservices, along with the dependencies, constitute an assurance graph.
        This module should be supported by an agent that is able to interact with the devices in order to produce the health statuses and symptoms for each subservice in an assurance graph.

        This module is intended for the following use cases:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>
            Assurance graph configuration:

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
                Subservices: Configure a set of subservices to assure by specifying their types and parameters.
              </li>
            <li>
                Dependencies: Configure the dependencies between the subservices, along with their types.
              </li>

        <li>
            Assurance telemetry: Export the assurance graph with health statuses and symptoms for each node.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        The module is also intended to be exported by the SAIN collector that aggregates the output of several SAIN agents to provide the global assurance graph.
        In that case, only the telemetry export use case is considered.

      <t>
        The second YANG module, "ietf-service-assurance-device" (<xref target="device-module" format="default"/>), augments the "ietf-service-assurance" module by adding support for the device subservice.
        Additional subservice types might be added following a similar approach.
      </t>
      <t>
        The third YANG module, "ietf-service-assurance-interface" (<xref target="interface-module" format="default"/>), augments the "ietf-service-assurance" module as well by adding support for the interface subservice.
      </t>
      <t>
        We provide additional examples in the appendix.
        The module "example-service-assurance-device-acme" (<xref target="acme-device-module" format="default"/>) augments the "ietf-service-assurance-device" module to customize it for devices of the fictional Acme Corporation.
        Additional vendor-specific parameters might be added following a similar approach.
        We also provide the modules "example-service-assurance-ip-connectivity" and "example-service-assurance-is-is" (<xref target="ip-connectivity-is-is" format="default"/>) to model the example in Figure 2 from <xref target="RFC9417" section="3.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>.

        <t>
          The "ietf-service-assurance" YANG module assumes a set of subservices to be assured independently.
          A subservice is a feature or a subpart of the network system that a given service instance depends on. Examples of subservice types include the following:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
              device: Whether a device is healthy, and if not, what are the symptoms?
              Such a subservice might monitor the device resources, such as CPU, RAM, or Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM).
              Potential symptoms are "CPU overloaded", "Out of RAM", or "Out of TCAM".
            </li>
          <li>
              ip-connectivity: Given two IP addresses bound to two devices, what is the quality of the IP connectivity between them?
              Potential symptoms are "No route available" or "Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) imbalance".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          An instance of the device subservice is representing a subpart of the network system, namely a specific device.
          An instance of the ip-connectivity subservice is representing a feature of the network, namely the connectivity between two specific IP addresses on two devices.
          In both cases, these subservices might depend on other subservices, for instance, the connectivity might depend on a subservice representing the routing system and on a subservice representing ECMPs.
        </t>
        <t>
          The two example subservices presented above need different sets of parameters to fully characterize one of their instances.
          An instance of the device subservice is fully characterized by a single parameter allowing to identify the device to monitor.
          For the ip-connectivity subservice, at least the device and IP address for both ends of the link are needed to fully characterize an instance.
        </t>
        <t>
          The base model presented in this section specifies a single type of subservice, which represents service instances.
          Such nodes play a particular role in the assurance graph because they represent the starting point, or root, for the assurance graph of the corresponding service instance.
          The parameters required to fully identify a service instance are the name of the service and the name of the service instance.
          To support other types of subservices, such as device or ip-connectivity,  the "ietf-service-assurance" module is intended to be augmented.
        </t>
        <t>
          The dependencies are modeled as a list, i.e., each subservice contains a list of references to its dependencies.
          That list can be empty if the subservice instance does not have any dependencies.
        </t>
        <t>
          By specifying service instances and their dependencies in terms of subservices, one defines a global assurance graph.
          That assurance graph is the result of merging all the individual assurance graphs for the assured service instances.
          Each subservice instance is expected to appear only once in the global assurance graph even if several service instances depend on it.
          For example, an instance of the device subservice is a dependency of every service instance that relies on the corresponding device.
          The assurance graph of a specific service instance is the subgraph obtained by traversing the global assurance graph through the dependencies, starting from the specific service instance.
        </t>
        <t>
          An assurance agent configured with such a graph is expected to produce, for each configured subservice,
          a health status that indicates how healthy the subservice is.
		  If the subservice is not healthy, the agent is expected to produce a list of symptoms explaining why the subservice is not healthy.

        <t>
          The date of the last change in "assurance-graph-last-change" is read only.
          It must be updated each time the graph structure is changed by addition or deletion of subservices and dependencies or modifications of their configurable attributes, including their maintenance statuses.
          Such modifications correspond to a structural change in the graph.
          The date of the last change is useful for a client to quickly check if there is a need to update the graph structure.
          A change in the health score or symptoms associated to a service or subservice does not change the structure of the graph, and thus has no effect on the date of the last change.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "subservices" list contains all the subservice instances currently known by the server (i.e., SAIN agent or SAIN collector).
          A subservice declaration <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide the following:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">

          <li>
              a subservice type ("type"): a reference to an identity that inherits from "subservice-base", which is the base identity for any subservice type
            </li>
          <li>
              an id ("id"): a string uniquely identifying the subservice among those with the same type
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          The type and id uniquely identify a given subservice.
        </t>
        <t>
            The "last-change" indicates when the dependencies or maintenance status of this particular subservice were last modified.
        </t>
        <t>
            The "label" is a human-readable description of the subservice.
        </t>
        <t>
          The presence of the "under-maintenance" container inhibits the emission of symptoms for the subservice and subservices that depend on them.
          In that case, a "contact" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provided to indicate who or which software is responsible for the maintenance.
          See <xref target="RFC9417" section="3.6" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> for a more detailed discussion.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "parameter" choice is intended to be augmented in order to describe parameters that are specific to the current subservice type.
          This base module defines only the subservice type representing service instances.
          Service instances <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be modeled as a particular type of subservice with two parameters: "service" and "instance-name".
          The "service" parameter is the name of the service defined in the network orchestrator, for instance, "point-to-point-l2vpn".
          The "instance-name" parameter is the name assigned to the particular instance to be assured, for instance, the name of the customer using that instance.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "health-score" contains a value normally between 0 and 100, indicating how healthy the subservice is.
          As mentioned in the health score definition, the special value -1 can be used to specify that no value could be computed for that health score, for instance, if some metric needed for that computation could not be collected.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "symptoms-history-start" is the cutoff date for reporting symptoms.
          Symptoms that were terminated before that date are not reported anymore in the model.
        </t>
        <t>
          The status of each subservice contains a list of symptoms.
          Each symptom is specified by:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li> an identifier "symptom-id", which identifies the symptom locally to an agent, </li>
          <li> an agent identifier "agent-id", which identifies the agent raising the symptom,</li>
          <li> a "health-score-weight" specifying  the impact to the health score incurred by this symptom,</li>
          <li> a "start-date-time" indicating when the symptom became active, and</li>
          <li> a "stop-date-time" indicating when the symptom stopped being active (this field is not present if the symptom is still active).</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          In order for the pair "agent-id" and "symptom-id" to uniquely identify a symptom, the following is necessary:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li> "agent-id" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique among all agents of the system. </li>
          <li> "symptom-id" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique among all symptoms raised by the agent. </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          Note that "agent-id" and "symptom-id" are leafrefs pointing to the objects defined later in the document.
          While the combination of "symptom-id" and "agent-id" is sufficient as a unique key list, the "start-date-time" second key helps to sort and retrieve relevant symptoms.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "dependency" list contains the dependencies for the current subservice.
          Each of them is specified by a leafref to both "type" and "id" of the target dependencies.
          A dependency has a type indicated in the "dependency-type" field. Two types are specified in the model:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Impacting: Such a dependency indicates an impact on the health of the dependent.</li>
          <li>Informational: Such a dependency might explain why the dependent has issues but does not impact its health.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          To illustrate the difference between "impacting" and "informational", consider the interface subservice representing a network interface.
          If the device to which the network interface belongs goes down, the network interface will transition to a "down" state as well.
          Therefore, the dependency of the interface subservice towards the device subservice is "impacting".
          On the other hand, a dependency towards the ecmp-load subservice, which checks that the load between ECMPs remains stable throughout time, is only "informational".
          Indeed, services might be perfectly healthy even if the load distribution between ECMPs changed.
          However, such an instability might be a relevant symptom for diagnosing the root cause of a problem.
        </t>
        <t>
          Within the container "agents", the list "agent" contains the list of symptoms per agent.
          The key of the list is the "id", which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique among agents of a given assurance system.
          For each agent, the list "symptoms-description" maps an "id" to its "description".
          The "id" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique among the symptoms raised by the agent.
        </t>
        <t>
          Within the container "assured-services", the list "assured-service" contains the subservices indexed by assured service instances.
          For each service type identified by the "service" leaf, all instances of that service are listed in the "instances" list.
          For each instance identified by the "name" leaf,  the "subservices" list contains all descendant subservices that are part of the assurance graph for that specific instance.
          These imbricated lists provide a query optimization to get the list of subservices in that assurance graph in a single query instead of recursively querying the dependencies of each subservice, starting from the node representing the service instance.

        <t>
          The relation between the health score ("health-score") and the "health-score-weight" of the currently active symptoms is not explicitly defined in this document.
          The only requirement is that a health score that is strictly smaller than 100 (the maximal value) must be explained by at least one symptom.
          A way to enforce that requirement is to first detect symptoms and then compute the health score based on the "health-score-weight" of the detected symptoms.
          As an example, such a computation could be to sum the "health-score-weight" of the active symptoms, subtract that value from 100, and change the value to 0 if the result is negative.
          The relation between health score and "health-score-weight" is left to the implementor (of an agent <xref target="RFC9417" format="default"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          Keeping the history of the graph structure is out of scope for this YANG module.
          Only the current version of the assurance graph can be fetched.
          In order to keep the history of the graph structure, some time-series database (TSDB) or similar storage must be used.

    "This module defines objects for assuring services based on their
     decomposition into so-called subservices, according to the 
     Service Assurance for Intent-based Networking (SAIN)
     architecture.

     The subservices hierarchically organized by dependencies
     constitute an assurance graph.  This module should be supported
     by an assurance agent that is able to interact with the devices
     in order to produce the health status and symptoms for each
     subservice in the assurance graph.

     This module is intended for the following use cases:
     * Assurance graph configuration:
       - Subservices: Configure a set of subservices to assure by
         specifying their types and parameters.
       - Dependencies: Configure the dependencies between the
         subservices, along with their type.
     * Assurance telemetry: Export the health statuses of the
       subservices, along with the observed symptoms.

        <name>Rejecting Circular Dependencies</name>
        <t>
          The statuses of services and subservices depend on the statuses of their dependencies, and thus circular dependencies between them prevent the computation of statuses.
          Section <xref target="RFC9417" sectionFormat="bare" section="3.1.1"/> of the SAIN architecture document <xref target="RFC9417" format="default"/> discusses how such dependencies appear and how they could be removed.
          The responsibility of avoiding such dependencies falls to the SAIN orchestrator.
          However, we specify in this section the expected behavior when a server supporting the "ietf-service-assurance" module receives a data instance containing circular dependencies.
        </t>
        <t>
          Enforcing the absence of circular dependencies as a YANG constraint falls back to implementing a graph traversal algorithm with XPath and checking that the current node is not reachable from its dependencies.
          Even with such a constraint, there is no guarantee that merging two graphs without dependency loops will result in a graph without dependency loops.
          Indeed, <xref target="RFC9417" section="3.1.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> presents an example where merging two graphs without dependency loops results in a graph with a dependency loop.
        </t>
        <t>
          Therefore, a server implementing the "ietf-service-assurance" module <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check that there is no dependency loop whenever the graph is modified.
          A modification creating a dependency loop <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be rejected.

      <name>Guidelines for Defining New Subservice Types</name>
      <t>
        The base YANG module defined in <xref target="ietf-service-assurance-yang-model" format="default"/> only defines a single type of subservice that represent service instances.
        As explained above, this model is meant to be augmented so that a variety of subservices can be used in the assurance graph.
        In this section, we propose some guidelines for specifying such extensions at IETF.
      </t>
      <t>
        The mechanism to add a new subservice type is to define a new module for that subservice.
        The module name should start with "ietf-service-assurance-".
    
        The namespace of the module should start with "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-service-assurance-".
        The prefix of the module should start with "sain-".
        For instance, the subservice type representing the assurance of a device should have:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>the name "ietf-service-assurance-device",</li>
    <li>the namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-service-assurance-device", and</li>
        <li>the prefix "sain-device".</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        The new module should define:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
            a new identity to represent the new type and
          </li>
        <li>
            the parameters fully specifying an instance of the new subservice type.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        The new identity should be based on the "subservice-base" identity.
        The name of the identity should end with "-type", for instance, "device-type".
      </t>
      <t>
        The parameters should be defined in a container named "parameters" that augments the choice "/subservices/subservice/parameter" from the main module.
        The augmentation should be restricted to cases where the type of the subservice matches the identity representing the new service type.

        We define two subservice types in the next sections: the "device" subservice type is defined in <xref target="device-module" format="default"/> and the "interface" subservice type is defined is <xref target="interface-module" format="default"/>.
        These subservices can be taken as examples of the rules defined in this section.

      <t>
        Vendors can specify their own subservices types by defining the corresponding modules in their own namespace.
        An example of such a vendor-specific module is specified in <xref target="acme-device-module" format="default"/>.
        Vendors can also augment existing IETF-specified subservices to add their own vendor-specific information.

          As the number of subservices will grow over time, the YANG module is designed to be extensible.
          A new subservice type requires the precise specifications of its type and expected parameters.
          Let us illustrate the example of the new device subservice type.
          As the name implies, it monitors and reports the device health, along with some symptoms in case of degradation.
        </t>
        <t>
          For our device subservice definition, the new identity "device-type" is specified as an inheritance from the base identity for subservices.
          This indicates to the assurance agent that we are now assuring the health of a device.
        </t>
        <t>
          The typical parameter for the configuration of the device subservice is the name of the device that we want to assure.
          By augmenting the parameter choice from the "ietf-service-assurance" YANG module for the case of the "device-type" subservice type, this new parameter is specified.

          For the interface subservice definition, the new interface-type is specified as an inheritance from the base identity for subservices.
          This indicates to the assurance agent that we are now assuring the health of an interface.

          The parameters for the configuration of the interface subservice are the name of the device and, on that specific device, a specific interface.

         The YANG modules specified in this document define schema for data 
         that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such 
         as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" format="default"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040" format="default"/>.
         The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242" format="default"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
         The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341" format="default"/>
         provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or 
         RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or 
         RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
      </t>
      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG modules that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default). These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
             /subservices/subservice :
             By modifying this subtree, one can modify the structure of the assurance graph, which could alter the status of the services reported by the assurance framework.
             On one hand, modifications can cause the assurance system to report a service as broken when it is actually healthy (false positive), resulting in engineers or automation software losing time and potentially causing real issues by doing unnecessary modifications on the network.
             On the other hand, modifications could prevent the assurance system from reporting actual issues (false negative), resulting in failures that could have been avoided.
             Depending on the service, the impact of these avoidable failures could be Service-Level Agreement (SLA) violations fees or disruption of emergency calls.
           </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        Some readable data nodes in these YANG modules may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>/subservices/subservice</li>
        <li>/agents/agent</li>
        <li>/assured-services/assured-service</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        Each of these subtrees contains information about services, subservices, or possible symptoms raised by the agents.
        The information contained in this subtree might give information about the underlying network as well as services deployed for the customers.
        For instance, a customer might be given access to monitor their services status (e.g., via model-driven telemetry).
        In that example, the customer access should be restricted to nodes representing their services so as not to divulge information about the underlying network structure or others customers services.

          Under some circumstances, vendor-specific subservice types might be required.
          As an example of this vendor-specific implementation, this section shows how to augment the "ietf-service-assurance-device" module to add custom support for the device subservice specific to the Acme Corporation.
          The specific version adds a new parameter named "acme-specific-parameter".
          It's an implementation choice to either derive a new specific identity from the "subservice-base" identity defined in the "ietf-service-assurance" module or to augment the parameters from the "ietf-service-assurance-device" module; here, we choose to create a new identity.

      <t>
        In this section, we provide two additional YANG modules to completely cover the example in Figure 2 from <xref target="RFC9417" section="3.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>.
        The two missing subservice types are IP connectivity and the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol.
        These  modules are presented as examples; some future work is needed to propose a more complete version.

          That subservice represents the unicast connectivity between two IP addresses located on two different devices.
          Such a subservice could report symptoms such as "No route found".

         Yangson requires a YANG library <xref target="RFC8525" format="default"/> to define the complete model against which the data instance must be validated.
         In <xref target="yang_library_for_validation" format="default"/>, we provide  the JSON library file named "ietf-service-assurance-library.json", which we used for validation.

         Below, we provide the contents of the file "example_configuration_instance.json", which contains the configuration data that models Figure 2 from <xref target="RFC9417" section="3.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>.
         The instance can be validated with yangson by using the invocation "yangson -v example_configuration_instance.json ietf-service-assurance-library.json", assuming all the files (YANG and JSON) defined in this document reside in the current folder.
