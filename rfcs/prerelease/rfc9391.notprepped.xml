      <t>This document defines scenarios where Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) <xref target="RFC8724"/> <xref target="RFC8824"/> are suitable for 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) protocol stacks.</t>
      <t>In the 3GPP and the NB-IoT networks, header compression efficiently brings Internet connectivity to the Device UE (Dev-UE), the radio (RGW-eNB) and network (NGW-MME) gateways, and the Application Server. This document describes the SCHC parameters supporting SCHC over the NB-IoT architecture.</t>
      <t>This document assumes functionality for NB-IoT of 3GPP release 15  <xref target="R15-3GPP"/>. Otherwise, the text explicitly mentions other versions' functionality.</t>
      
      <t>This document has two parts: normative end-to-end scenarios describing how any application must use SCHC over the 3GPP public service and informational scenarios about how 3GPP could use SCHC in their protocol stack network.</t>

      <name>NB-IoT Architecture</name>
      <t>The NB-IoT architecture has a complex structure.
      It relies on different Network Gateways (NGWs) from different providers. It can send data via different paths, each with different characteristics in terms of bandwidth, acknowledgments, and L2 reliability and segmentation.</t>
      
      <t><xref target="Figure-Archi"/> shows this architecture, where the Network Gateway - Cellular IoT Serving Gateway Node (NGW-CSGN) optimizes co-locating entities in different paths. For example, a Dev-UE using the path formed by the Network Gateway - Mobility Management Entity (NGW-MME), the NGW-CSGW, and the Network Gateway - Packet Data Network Gateway (NGW-PGW) may get a limited bandwidth transmission from a few bytes/s to one thousand bytes/s only.</t>
      <t>Another node introduced in the NB-IoT architecture is the Network Gateway - Service Capability Exposure Function (NGW-SCEF),
which securely exposes service and network capabilities to entities external to the network operator. The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) <xref target="OMA0116"/> and the One Machine to Machine (OneM2M) <xref target="TR-0024"/> define the northbound APIs. <xref target="TS23222"/> defines architecture for the common API framework for 3GPP northbound APIs. <xref target="TS33122"/> defines security aspects for a common API framework for 3GPP northbound APIs. In this case, the path is small for data transmission. 
The main functions of the NGW-SCEF are path connectivity and device monitoring.</t>

      <name>Data Transmission in the 3GPP Architecture</name>
      <t>NB-IoT networks deal with end-to-end user data and in-band signaling between the nodes and functions to configure, control, and monitor the system functions and behaviors. The signaling uses a different path with specific protocols, handling processes, and entities but can transport end-to-end user data for IoT services. In contrast, the end-to-end application only transports end-to-end data.</t>
      <t>The recommended 3GPP MTU size is 1358 bytes. The radio network protocols limit the packet sizes over the air, including radio protocol overhead, to 1600 bytes; see <xref target="Radio-Parameters"/>. However, the recommended 3GPP MTU is smaller to avoid fragmentation in the network backbone due to the payload encryption size (multiple of 16) and the additional core transport overhead handling.</t>
      <t>3GPP standardizes NB-IoT and, in general, the interfaces and functions of cellular technologies. Therefore, the introduction of SCHC entities to Dev-UE, RGW-eNB, and NGW-CSGN needs to be specified in the NB-IoT standard.</t>

      <t>This document identifies the use cases of SCHC over the NB-IoT architecture.</t>
      <t>The first use case is of the radio transmission (see <xref target="Radio"/>) where the Dev-UE and the RGW-eNB can use the SCHC functionalities.</t>
      <t>The second is where the packets transmitted over the control path can also use SCHC when the transmission goes over the NGW-MME or NGW-SCEF (see <xref target="DONAS"/>).</t>
      <t>These two use cases are also valid for any 3GPP architecture and not only for NB-IoT. And as the 3GPP internal network is involved, they have been put in the informational part of this section.</t>
      <t>And the third covers the SCHC over Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) connection or at least up to the operator network edge (see <xref target="E2E"/>). In this case, SCHC functionalities are available in the application layer of the Dev-UE and the Application Servers or a broker function at the edge of the operator network. NGW-PGW or NGW-SCEF transmit the packets that are Non-IP traffic, using IP tunneling or API calls. It is also possible to benefit legacy devices with SCHC by using the Non-IP transmission features of the operator network.</t>
      <t>A Non-IP transmission refers to an L2 transport that is different from NB-IoT.</t>
      <section anchor="normative-part">

        <name>Normative Scenarios</name>
        <t>These scenarios do not modify the 3GPP architecture or any of its
        components. They only use the architecture as an L2
        transmission.</t>
        <section anchor="E2E">
          <name>SCHC over Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD)</name>
          <t>This section specifies the use of SCHC over NIDD services of 3GPP. The NIDD services of 3GPP enable the transmission of SCHC packets compressed by the application layer. The packets can be delivered between the NGW-PGW and the Application Server or between the NGW-SCEF and the Application Server, using IP-tunnels or API calls. In both cases, as compression occurs before transmission, the network will not understand the packet, and the network does not have context information of this compression. Therefore, the network will treat the packet as Non-IP traffic and deliver it to the other side without any other protocol stack element, directly over L2.</t>
          <section anchor="schc-entities-placing-over-nidd">
            <name>SCHC Entities Placing over NIDD</name>
            <t>In the two scenarios using NIDD compression, SCHC entities are located almost on top of the stack. The NB-IoT connectivity services implement SCHC in the Dev-UE, an in the Application Server. The IP tunneling scenario requires that the Application Server send the compressed packet over an IP connection terminated by the 3GPP core network. If the transmission uses the NGW-SCEF services, it is possible to utilize an API call to transfer the SCHC packets between the core network and the Application Server. Also, an IP tunnel could be established by the Application Server if negotiated with the NGW-SCEF.</t>

            <name>Parameters for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation (SCHC)</name>
            <t>These scenarios <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use the SCHC header compression
            capability to improve the transmission of IPv6 packets.</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li><t>SCHC Context Initialization</t>
	      <t>The application layer handles the static context.
	      Consequently, the context distribution <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
	      according to the application's capabilities, perhaps utilizing
	      IP data transmissions up to context initialization. Also, the
	      static context delivery may use the same IP tunneling or
	      NGW-SCEF services used later for the transport of SCHC packets.</t></li>
              <li><t>SCHC Rules</t>
	      <t>For devices acting as a capillary gateway, several rules
	      match the diversity of devices and protocols used by the devices
	      associated with the gateway. Meanwhile, simpler devices may have
	      predetermined protocols and fixed parameters.</t></li>
              <li><t>RuleID</t>

	      <t>This scenario can dynamically set the RuleID size before the
	      context delivery, for example, by negotiating between the
	      applications when choosing a profile according to the type of
	      traffic and application deployed.  Transmission optimization may
	      require only one Physical Layer transmission. SCHC overhead
	      <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> exceed the available number of
	      effective bits of the smallest physical Transport Block (TB) available to optimize
	      the transmission. The packets handled by 3GPP networks are
	      byte-aligned. Thus, to use the smallest TB, the maximum SCHC
	      header size is 12 bits. On the other hand, more complex NB-IoT
	      devices (such as a capillary gateway) might require additional
	      bits to handle the variety and multiple parameters of
	      higher-layer protocols deployed.  The configuration may be part
	      of the agreed operation profile and content distribution. 
              The RuleID field size may range from 2 bits, resulting in 4
              rules, to an 8-bit value, yielding up to 256 rules for use by
              operators.  A 256-rule maximum limit seems to be quite
              reasonable, even for a device acting as a NAT.  An application
              may use a larger RuleID, but it should consider the byte
              alignment of the expected Compression Residue. In the minimum TB
              size case, 2 bits of RuleID leave only 6 bits available for
              Compression Residue.</t></li>
              <li><t>SCHC MAX_PACKET_SIZE</t>
	      <t>In these scenarios, the maximum <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
	      MTU size is 1358 bytes since the SCHC packets (and fragments)
	      are traversing the whole 3GPP network infrastructure (core and
	      radio), not only the radio as in the IP transmissions
	      case.</t></li>
              <li><t>Fragmentation</t>
	      <t>Packets larger than 1358 bytes need the SCHC fragmentation
	      function. Since the 3GPP uses reliability functions, the No-ACK
	      fragmentation mode <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be enough in
	      point-to-point connections. Nevertheless, additional
	      considerations are described below for more complex
	      cases.</t></li>
              <li><t>Fragmentation Modes</t>
	      <t>A global service assigns a QoS to the packets, e.g., depending
	      on the billing. Packets with very low QoS may get lost before
	      arriving in the 3GPP radio network transmission, e.g., in
	      between the links of a capillary gateway or due to buffer
	      overflow handling in a backhaul connection.  The use of SCHC
	      fragmentation with the ACK-on-Error mode is
	      <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to secure additional reliability on
	      the packets transmitted with a small trade-off on further
	      transmissions to signal the end-to-end arrival of the packets if
	      no transport protocol takes care of retransmission.<br/> Also,
	      the ACK-on-Error mode could be desirable to keep track of all
	      the SCHC packets delivered. In that case, the fragmentation
	      function could be activated for all packets transmitted by the
	      applications.  SCHC ACK-on-Error fragmentation
	      <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be activated in transmitting Non-IP packets
	      on the NGW-MME. A Non-IP packet will use SCHC reserved RuleID
	      for non-compressing packets as <xref target="RFC8724"/> allows it.</t></li>
              <li><t>Fragmentation Parameters</t>
	      <t>SCHC profile will have specific Rules for the fragmentation
	      modes. The rule will identify which fragmentation mode is in
	      use, and <xref target="Radio-Parameters"/> defines the RuleID
	      size.</t></li></ul>
            <t>SCHC parametrization considers that NB-IoT aligns the bit and
            uses padding and the size of the Transfer Block. SCHC will try to
            reduce padding to optimize the compression of the information. The
            header size needs to be a multiple of 4. The Tiles
            <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> keep a fixed value of 4 or 8 bits to avoid
            padding, except for when the transfer block equals 16 bits as
            the Tiles may be 2 bits. The transfer block size has a wide range
            of values. Two configurations are <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> for
            the fragmentation parameters.</t>

            <t>The IoT devices communicate with small data transfers and use the Power Save Mode and the Idle Mode Discontinuous Reception (DRX), which govern how often the device wakes up, stays up, and is reachable. The use of the different modes allows the battery to last ten years. Table 10.5.163a in <xref target="TS24008"/> defines the radio timer values with units incrementing by N. The units of N can be 1 hour or 10 hours. The range used for IoT is of N to 3N, where N increments by one. 

	    The Inactivity Timer and the Retransmission Timer can be set based on these limits.</t>

          <name>Use of SCHC over the Radio Link</name>
          <t>Deploying SCHC over the Radio Link only would require placing it as part of the protocol stack for data transfer between the Dev-UE and the RGW-eNB. This stack is the functional layer responsible for transporting data over the wireless connection and managing radio resources. There is support for features such as reliability, segmentation, and concatenation. The transmissions use link adaptation, meaning that the system will optimize the transport format used according to the radio conditions, the number of bits to transmit, and the power and interference constraints. That means that the number of bits transmitted over the air depends on the selected Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCSs). Transport Block (TB) transmissions happen in the Physical Layer at network-synchronized intervals called Transmission Time Interval (TTI). Each TB has a different MCS and number of bits available to transmit. The MAC layer <xref target="TR36321"/> defines the characteristics of the TBs. The Radio Link stack shown in <xref target="Fig-ProtocolArchi3"/> comprises the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) <xref target="TS36323"/>, the Radio Link Protocol (RLC) <xref target="TS36322"/>, the Medium Access Control protocol (MAC) <xref target="TR36321"/>, and the Physical Layer <xref target="TS36201"/>. <xref target="AppendixA"/> gives more details about these protocols.</t>

            <name>Placing SCHC Entities over the Radio Link</name>
            <t>The 3GPP architecture supports Robust Header Compression (ROHC) <xref target="RFC5795"/> in the PDCP layer. Therefore, the architecture can deploy SCHC header compression entities similarly without the need for significant changes in the 3GPP specifications.</t>
            <t>The RLC layer has three functional modes: Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledged Mode (UM), and Acknowledged Mode (AM). The mode of operation controls the functionalities of the RLC layer.
TM only applies to signaling packets, while AM or UM carry signaling and data packets.</t>

<t>The RLC layer takes care of fragmentation except for the TM. In AM or UM, the SCHC fragmentation is unnecessary and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be used. While sending IP packets, the Radio Link does not commonly use the RLC TM. However, if other protocol overhead optimizations are targeted for NB-IoT traffic, SCHC fragmentation may be used for TM transmission in the future.</t>

          <name>Use of SCHC over the Non-Access Stratum (NAS)</name>
          <t>This section consists of IETF suggestions to the 3GPP. The NGW-MME conveys mainly signaling between the Dev-UE and the cellular network <xref target="TR24301"/>. The network transports this traffic on top of the Radio Link.</t>
          <t>This kind of flow supports data transmissions to reduce the overhead when transmitting infrequent small quantities of data. This transmission is known as Data over Non-Access Stratum (DoNAS) or Control Plane CIoT EPS optimizations. In DoNAS, the Dev-UE uses the pre-established security, can piggyback small uplink data into the initial uplink message, and uses an additional message to receive a downlink small data response.</t>
          <t>The NGW-MME performs the data encryption from the network side in a DoNAS PDU. Depending on the data type signaled indication (IP or Non-IP data), the network allocates an IP address or establishes a direct forwarding path.
DoNAS is regulated under rate control upon previous agreement, meaning that a maximum number of bits per unit of time is agreed upon per device subscription beforehand and configured in the device.</t>
          <t>The system will use DoNAS when a terminal in a power-saving state requires a short transmission and receives an acknowledgment or short feedback from the network. Depending on the size of the buffered data to be transmitted, the Dev-UE might deploy the connected mode transmission instead. The connected mode would limit and control the DoNAS transmissions to predefined thresholds, and it would be a good resource optimization balance for the terminal and the network. The support for mobility of DoNAS is present but produces additional overhead. <xref target="AppendixB"/> gives additional details of DoNAS.</t>

            <name>Placing SCHC Entities over DoNAS</name>
            <t>SCHC resides in this scenario's Non-Access Stratum (NAS) protocol layer. The same principles as for <xref target="Radio"/> apply here as well. Because the NAS protocol already uses ROHC <xref target="RFC5795"/>, it can also adapt SCHC for header compression. The main difference compared to the Radio Link (<xref target="Radio"/>) is the physical placing of the SCHC entities. On the network side, the NGW-MME resides in the core network and is the terminating node for NAS instead of the RGW-eNB.</t>

          <name>Parameters for Static Context Header Compression and
          Fragmentation (SCHC) for the Radio Link and DoNAS Use Cases</name>
          <t>If 3GPP incorporates SCHC, it is recommended that these scenarios
          use the SCHC header compression <xref target="RFC8724"/> capability to
          optimize the data transmission.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li><t>SCHC Context Initialization</t>
	    <t>The Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol is the main tool used
	    to configure the parameters of the Radio Link. It will configure
	    SCHC and the static context distribution as it has been made for ROHC operation
	    <xref target="RFC5795"/> <xref
	    target="TS36323"/>.</t></li>
            <li><t>SCHC Rules</t>
	    <t>The network operator defines the number of
	    rules in these scenarios. For this, the network operator must know the IP traffic the
	    device will carry. The operator might supply rules compatible with
	    the device's use case.  For devices acting as a capillary gateway,
	    several rules match the diversity of devices and protocols used by
	    the devices associated with the gateway. Meanwhile, simpler
	    devices may have predetermined protocols and fixed parameters.
	    The use of IPv6 and IPv4 may force the operator to develop more rules to deal with
	    each case.</t></li>
            <li><t>RuleID</t>
            <t>There is a reasonable assumption of 9 bytes of radio protocol
            overhead for these transmission scenarios in NB-IoT, where PDCP
            uses 5 bytes due to header and integrity protection and where RLC
            and MAC use 4 bytes. The minimum physical TBs
            that can withhold this overhead value, according to the 3GPP
            Release 15 specification <xref target="R15-3GPP"/>, are 88, 104,
            120, and 144 bits.  As for <xref target="Config"/>, these
            scenarios must optimize the Physical Layer where the smallest TB
            is 12 bits.  These 12 bits must include the Compression Residue in
            addition to the RuleID. On the other hand, more complex NB-IoT
            devices (such as a capillary gateway) might require additional
            bits to handle the variety and multiple parameters of higher-layer
            protocols deployed. In that sense, the operator may want
            flexibility on the number and type of rules independently
            supported by each device; consequently, these scenarios require a
            configurable value.  The configuration may be part of the agreed
            operation profile with the content distribution.  The RuleID field
            size may range from 2 bits, resulting in 4 rules, to an 8-bit
            value, yielding up to 256 rules for use with the operators.  A
            256-rule maximum limit seems to be quite reasonable, even for a
            device acting as a NAT.  An application may use a larger RuleID,
            but it should consider the byte alignment of the expected
            Compression Residue. In the minimum TB size case, 2 bits of RuleID
            leave only 6 bits available for Compression Residue.</t></li>
            <li><t>SCHC MAX_PACKET_SIZE</t>
            <t>The Radio Link can handle the fragmentation of SCHC packets if
            needed, including reliability. Hence, the packet size is limited
            by the MTU that is handled by the radio protocols, which
            corresponds to 1600 bytes for the 3GPP Release 15.</t></li>
            <li><t>Fragmentation</t>
            <t>For the Radio Link (<xref target="Radio"/>) and DoNAS (<xref
            target="DONAS"/>) scenarios, the SCHC fragmentation functions are
            disabled. The RLC layer of NB-IoT can segment packets into
            suitable units that fit the selected TB for
            transmissions of the Physical Layer. The block selection is made
            according to the link adaptation input function in the MAC layer
            and the quantity of data in the buffer. The link adaptation layer
            may produce different results at each TTI, resulting in varying
	    physical TBs that depend
            on the network load, interference, number of bits transmitted, and
            QoS. Even if setting a value that allows the construction of data
            units following the SCHC tiles principle, the protocol overhead
            may be greater or equal to allowing the Radio Link protocols to
            take care of the fragmentation intrinsically.</t></li>
            <li><t>Fragmentation in RLC TM</t>
            <t>The RLC TM mostly applies to control signaling
            transmissions. When RLC operates in TM, the MAC
            layer mechanisms ensure reliability and generate overhead. This
            additional reliability implies sending repetitions or automatic
            retransmissions.</t>
          <t>The ACK-Always fragmentation mode of SCHC may reduce this
          overhead in future operations when data transmissions may use this
          mode. The ACK-Always mode may transmit compressed data with fewer
          possible transmissions by using fixed or limited TBs
          compatible with the tiling SCHC fragmentation handling. For SCHC
          fragmentation parameters, see <xref target="Config"/>.</t></li></ul>

        <t>Each of the Radio Bearers (RBs) is associated with one PDCP entity <xref target="TS36323"/>. Moreover, a PDCP entity is associated with one or two RLC entities, depending on the unidirectional or bidirectional characteristics of the RB and RLC mode used. A PDCP entity is associated with either a control plane or a user plane with independent configuration and functions. The maximum supported size for NB-IoT of a PDCP SDU is 1600 octets. The primary services and functions of the PDCP sublayer for NB-IoT for the user plane include:</t>

        <t>RLC <xref target="TS36322"/> is an L2 protocol that operates between the User Equipment (UE) and the base station (eNB). It supports the packet delivery from higher layers to MAC, creating packets transmitted over the air, optimizing the TB utilization. RLC flow of data packets is unidirectional, and it is composed of a transmitter located in the transmission device and a receiver located in the destination device. Therefore, to configure bidirectional flows, two sets of entities, one in each direction (downlink and uplink), must be configured and effectively peered to each other. The peering allows the transmission of control packets (e.g., status reports) between entities. RLC can be configured for a data transfer in one of the following modes:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li><t>Transparent Mode (TM)</t>
	  <t>RLC does not segment or concatenate SDUs from higher layers in
	  this mode and does not include any header with the payload. RLC
	  receives SDUs from upper layers when acting as a transmitter and
	  transmits directly to its flow RLC receiver via lower
	  layers. Similarly, upon reception, a TM RLC receiver would not
	  process the packets and only deliver them to higher layers.</t></li>
          <li><t>Unacknowledged Mode (UM)</t>
	  <t>This mode provides support for segmentation and concatenation of
	  payload. The RLC packet's size depends on the indication given at a
	  particular transmission opportunity by the lower layer (MAC) and is
	  octet-aligned. The packet delivery to the receiver does not include
	  reliability support, and the loss of a segment from a packet means a
	  complete packet loss. Also, in lower-layer retransmissions, there is
	  no support for re-segmentation in case the radio
	  conditions change and trigger the selection of a smaller TB.
	  Additionally, it provides PDU duplication detection and
	  discards, out-of-sequence reordering, and loss
	  detection.</t></li>
          <li><t>Acknowledged Mode (AM)</t>

	  <t>In addition to the same functions supported by UM, this mode also
	  adds a moving windows-based reliability service on top of the lower-layer 
	  services. 
          It also supports re-segmentation, and it requires
	  bidirectional communication to exchange acknowledgment reports,
	  called RLC Status Reports, and to trigger retransmissions. This model
	  also supports protocol-error detection. The mode used depends on the
	  operator configuration for the type of data to be transmitted. For
	  example, data transmissions supporting mobility or requiring high
	  reliability would be most likely configured using AM. Meanwhile,
	  streaming and real-time data would be mapped to a UM
	  configuration.</t></li>

        <name>Medium Access Control (MAC)</name>

<t>MAC <xref target="TR36321"/> provides a mapping between the higher layers abstraction called Logical Channels (which are comprised by the previously described protocols) and the Physical Layer channels (transport channels).

Additionally, MAC may multiplex packets from different Logical Channels and prioritize which ones to fit into one TB if there is data and space available to maximize data transmission efficiency. MAC also provides error correction and reliability support through Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ), transport format selection, and scheduling information reported from the terminal to the network. MAC also adds the necessary padding and piggyback control elements, when possible, as well as the higher layers data.</t>

      <t>The Access Stratum (AS) protocol stack used by DoNAS is specific because the radio network still needs to establish the security associations and reduce the protocol overhead so that the PDCP is bypassed until the AS security is activated. By default, RLC uses the AM. However, depending on the network's features and the terminal, RLC may change to other modes by the network operator. For example, the TM does not add any header nor process the payload to reduce the overhead, but the MTU would be limited by the TB used to transmit the data, which is a couple of thousand bits maximum. If UM (only terminals compatible with 3GPP Release 15 <xref target="R15-3GPP"/>) is used, the RLC mechanisms of reliability are disabled, and only the reliability provided by the MAC layer by HARQ is available. In this case, the protocol overhead might be smaller than the AM case because of the lack of status reporting, but the overhead would have the same support for segmentation up to 1600 bytes. NAS packets are encapsulated within an RRC <xref target="TS36331"/> message.</t>
<t>Depending on the data type indication signaled (IP or Non-IP data), the network allocates an IP address or establishes a direct forwarding path. DoNAS is regulated under rate control upon previous agreement, meaning that a maximum number of bits per unit of time is agreed upon per device subscription beforehand and configured in the device. The use of DoNAS is typically expected when a terminal in a power-saving state requires a short transmission and is receiving an acknowledgment or short feedback from the network.
Depending on the size of buffered data to be transmitted, the UE might be instructed to deploy the connected mode transmissions instead, limiting and controlling the DoNAS transmissions to predefined thresholds and a good resource optimization balance for the terminal and the network. The support for mobility of DoNAS is present but produces additional overhead.</t>
