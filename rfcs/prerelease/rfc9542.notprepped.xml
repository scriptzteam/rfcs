<section> <!-- 1. -->
  <name>Introduction</name>
  <t>Some IETF protocols use Ethernet or other communication frame formats
  and parameters related to IEEE 802 <xref target="IEEE802"/>.
  These include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and protocol
  identifiers. The IEEE Registration Authority <xref
  target="IEEE_RA"/> manages the assignment of identifiers used in
  IEEE 802 networks, in some cases assigning blocks of such
  identifiers whose sub-assignment is managed by the entity to which
  the block is assigned. The IEEE RA also provides a number of
  tutorials concerning these parameters <xref
  target="IEEEtutorials"/>.</t>

  <t>IANA has been assigned an Organizationally Unique Identifier
  (OUI) by the IEEE RA and an associated set of MAC addresses and
  other organizationally unique code points based on that OUI.  This
  document specifies IANA considerations for the assignment of code
  points under that IANA OUI, including MAC addresses and protocol
  identifiers, and provides some values for use in documentation. As
  noted in <xref target="RFC2606"/> and <xref target="RFC5737"/>, the
  use of designated code values reserved for documentation and
  examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and confusion arising
  from such code points conflicting with code points assigned for some
  deployed use. This document also discusses several other uses by the
  IETF of IEEE 802 code points, including IEEE 802 Connectivity Fault
  Management (CFM) code points <xref target="RFC7319"/> and IEEE 802
  Link Local Discovery Protocol (LLDP) <xref target="IEEE802.1AB"/>
  Vendor-Specific TLV Sub-Types <xref target="RFC8520"/>. It
  also specifies Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) tags for MAC addresses and OUIs / Company Identifiers (CIDs).</t>

  <t>Descriptions herein of <xref target="IANA"/> policies and
  procedures are authoritative, but descriptions of IEEE registration
  policies, procedures, and standards are only informative; for
  authoritative IEEE information, consult the IEEE sources.</t>

  <t><xref target="RFC8126"/> is incorporated herein except where
  there are contrary provisions in this document.  In this document,
  "IESG Ratification", specified in <xref target="ex-rev-iesg-rat"/>, refers to a
  combination of Expert Review and IESG Approval as those are defined
  in <xref target="RFC8126"/>, where IESG Approval is required only if
  the Expert does not reject the request. It is NOT the same as just
  "IESG Approval" in <xref target="RFC8126"/>.</t>

    <name>Notations Used in This Document</name>

<t>This document uses hexadecimal notation.  Each octet (that is,
8-bit byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits giving the value
of the octet as an unsigned integer.  Successive octets are separated
by a hyphen.  This document consistently uses IETF ("network") bit
ordering although the physical order of bit transmission within an
octet on an IEEE <xref target="IEEE.802.3_2012"/> link is from the lowest
order bit to the highest order bit (i.e., the reverse of the IETF's
ordering).</t>

  <name>48-Bit MAC Identifiers, OUIs, and Other Prefixes</name>

<t>48-bit MAC "addresses" are the most commonly used Ethernet
interface identifiers.  Those that are globally unique are also called
EUI&nbhy;48 identifiers (Extended Unique Identifier 48).  An
EUI&nbhy;48 is structured into an initial prefix assigned by the IEEE
Registration Authority and additional bits assigned by the prefix
owner.  As of 2024, there are three lengths of prefixes assigned, as
shown in the table below; however, some prefix bits can have special
meaning, as shown in <xref target="MACaddr"/>.</t>

<table align="center">
  <thead>
<tr><th>Prefix Length in Bits</th><th>Name</th><th>Owner Supplied
Bits for 48&nbhy;bit MAC Addresses</th></tr>

<tr><td align="center">28</td><td>MA-M</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">36</td><td>MA-S</td><td align="center">12</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<t>The bottom (least significant) four bits of the first octet of the
6-octet 48-bit MAC have special meaning, as shown in <xref
target="MACaddr"/>, and are referred to below as the M, X, Y, and Z
bits.</t>

<t>For global addresses, X = 0 and a MAC address begins with 3 octets or
a larger initial prefix indicating the assignee of the block of MAC
addresses. This prefix is followed by a sequence of additional octets
so as to add up to the total MAC address length.  For example, the
IEEE assigns MAC Address Block Small (MA-S), where the first four and
a half octets (36 bits) are assigned, giving the holder of the MA-S
one and a half octets (12 bits) they can control in constructing
48-bit MAC addresses; other prefix lengths are also available <xref
target="IEEEtutorials"/>.</t>

<t>An AFN, a DNS RRTYPE, and a CBOR tag have been assigned for 48-bit
MAC addresses, as discussed in Sections <xref target="cbor-tags" format="counter"/>, <xref target="mac-addresses" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="cbor-tag-assign" format="counter"/>.</t>

<t>IEEE Std 802 describes assignment procedures and policies for
identifiers related to IEEE 802 <xref target="IEEE802_OandA"/>. IEEE RA
documentation on EUIs, OUIs, and CIDs is available at <xref
target="IEEEtutorials"/>. </t>

<section anchor="first-oct-bit"> <!-- 2.1.1 -->
  <name>Special First Octet Bits</name>

<t>There are bits within the initial octet of an IEEE MAC address that
have special significance <xref target="IEEE802_OandA"/>, as described as
follows:</t>

<dl>
<dt>M bit -</dt><dd>This bit is frequently referred to as the "group" or
"multicast" bit.  If it is zero, the MAC address is unicast. If it is a
one, the address is groupcast (multicast or broadcast). This meaning
is independent of the values of the X, Y, and Z bits.</dd>

<dt>X bit -</dt><dd>This bit is also called the "universal/local"
bit (formerly called the Local/Global bit). If it is zero, the MAC address is a global address under the
control of the owner of the IEEE-assigned prefix. Previously, if it
was a one, the MAC address was considered "local" and under the
assignment and control of the local network operator (but see <xref target="bit-48-ietf"/>). If it is a one and if the IEEE 802 Structured Local Address Plan
(SLAP) is in effect, the nature of the MAC address is optionally
determined by the Y and Z bits, as described below.</dd>

<dt>Y&amp;Z bits -</dt><dd>These two bits have no special meaning if the X
bit is zero. If the X bit is one and if the IEEE 802 Structured
Local Address Plan (SLAP) is in effect, these two bits divide the
formerly uniform "local" MAC address space into four quadrants as
follows and further described below:</dd>
</dl>

<table align="center">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Y bit</th><th>Z bit</th><th>Quadrant</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

<tr><td align="center">0</td><td
align="center">0</td><td>Administratively Assigned</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">1</td><td>Extended
Local</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">1</td><td
align="center">0</td><td>Reserved</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td>Standard
Assigned</td></tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<t>While a local network administrator can assign any addresses with
the X bit a one, the optional SLAP characterizes the four quadrants of
the "local" address space using the Y and Z bits as follows:</t>

<dl>
  <dt>Administratively Assigned -</dt>
  <dd>MAC addresses in this quadrant are called Administratively
  Assigned Identifiers. This is intended for arbitrary local
  assignment, such as random assignment; however, see <xref target="id-33-33"/>.</dd>

  <dt>Extended Local -</dt>
  <dd>MAC addresses in this quadrant are called Extended Local
  Identifiers. These addresses are not actually "local" under
  SLAP. They are available to the organization that has been assigned
  the CID (see <xref target="oui-cid"/>) specifying the other 20 bits of the
  24-bit prefix with X, Y, and Z bits having the values 1, 0, and 1,
  respectively.</dd>

  <dt>Reserved -</dt>
  <dd>MAC addresses in this quadrant are reserved for future use under
  the SLAP. Until such future use, they could be locally assigned as
  Administratively Assigned Identifiers are assigned, but there is a
  danger that future SLAP use would conflict with such local
  assignments.</dd>

  <dt>Standard Assigned -</dt>
  <dd>MAC addresses in this quadrant are called Standard Assigned
  Identifiers (SAIs). An SAI is assigned by a protocol specified in an
  IEEE 802 standard, for example, <xref target="IEEE802.1CQ"/> (but see
  the first NOTE below).</dd>
</dl>

<t indent="6">NOTE: While the SLAP has MAC addresses assigned through
a local protocol in the SAI quadrant and assigned by a protocol
specified in an IEEE 802 standard, the SLAP is optional. Local network
administrators may use the IETF protocol provisions in <xref
target="RFC8947"/> and <xref target="RFC8948"/>, which support
assignment of a MAC address in the local MAC address space using
DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"/> or other protocol methods.</t>

<t>NOTE: There isn't any automated way to determine if or
to what extent a local network is configured for and/or operating
according to SLAP.</t>

</section> <!-- 2.1.1 -->

<section anchor="oui-cid"> <!-- 2.1.2 -->
  <name>OUIs and CIDs</name>

<t>MA-L, MA-M, and MA-S MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit
zero.  The assignee of an OUI is exclusively authorized to assign
group MAC addresses by extending a modified version of the assigned
OUI in which the M bit (see <xref target="MACaddr"/>) is set to 1
<xref target="IEEEtutorials"/>.</t>

<t>The Local bit is zero for globally unique EUI&nbhy;48 identifiers
assigned by the owner of a MAC-L or owner of a longer prefix.  If the
Local bit is a one, the identifier has historically been a local
identifier under the control of the local network administrator;
however, there are now recommendations on optional management of the
local address space, as discussed in <xref target="first-oct-bit"/>.  If the Local bit
is a one, the holder of an OUI has no special authority over MAC
identifiers whose first 3 octets correspond to their OUI or the
beginning of their longer prefix.</t>

<t>A CID is a 24-bit Company Identifier. It is assigned for
organizations that need such an identifier that can be used in place
of an OUI but do not need to assign subsidiary global MAC
addresses. A CID has X and Z bits equal to 1 and its Y bit equal to 0
(see <xref target="MACaddr"/>).</t>

<t>An AFN and a CBOR tag have been assigned for OUIs/CIDs, as discussed
in Sections <xref target="cbor-tags" format="counter"/>, <xref target="mac-addresses" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="cbor-tag-assign" format="counter"/>.</t>

  <name>64-Bit MAC Identifiers</name>

<t>IEEE also defines a system of 64-bit MAC identifiers, including
EUI&nbhy;64s.  EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers are used as follows:</t>

<ul>
  <li>In IEEE Std 1394 <xref target="IEEE1394"/> (also known as
  FireWire and i.Link)</li>

  <li>In IEEE Std 802.15.4 <xref target="IEEE802.15.4"/> (also known

  <li>In <xref target="InfiniBand"/></li>

  <li>In a modified form to construct some IPv6 Interface Identifiers,
  as described in <xref target="ipv6"/>, although this use is now
  deprecated</li>
</ul>

<t>Adding a 5-octet (40-bit) extension to a 3-octet (24-bit)
assignment, or a shorter extension to longer assigned prefixes <xref
target="I-D.ieee-rac-oui-restructuring"/> so as to total 64 bits, produces an EUI&nbhy;64
identifier under that OUI or longer prefix.  As with EUI&nbhy;48
identifiers, the first octet has the same special low-order bits.</t>

<t>An AFN, a DNS RRTYPE, and CBOR tag have been assigned for 64-bit
MAC addresses, as discussed in Sections <xref target="cbor-tags" format="counter"/>, <xref target="mac-addresses" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="cbor-tag-assign" format="counter"/>. </t>

<t>The discussion below is almost entirely in terms of the "Modified"
form of EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers; however, anyone assigned such an
identifier can also use the unmodified form as a MAC identifier on any
link that uses such 64-bit identifiers for interfaces. </t>

<section anchor="ipv6">  <!-- 2.2.1 -->
  <name>IPv6 Use of Modified EUI&nbhy;64 Identifiers</name>

<t>The approach described below for constructing IPv6 Interface
Identifiers is now deprecated, and the method specified in <xref
target="RFC8064"/> is recommended.</t>
  
<t>EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers have been used to form the lower 64 bits of
some IPv6 addresses (Section <xref target="RFC4291" section="2.5.1" sectionFormat="bare"/> and Appendix <xref target="RFC4291" section="A" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref
target="RFC4291"/> and <xref target="RFC5214" sectionFormat="of" section="A"/>).  When
so used, the EUI&nbhy;64 is modified by inverting the X (universal/local)
bit to form an IETF "Modified EUI&nbhy;64 identifier".  Below is an
illustration of a Modified EUI&nbhy;64 unicast identifier under the
IANA OUI, where aa-bb-cc-dd-ee is the extension. </t>

<t indent="3">02-00-5E-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee</t>

<t>The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified
EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers, the sense of the X bit is inverted compared
with EUI&nbhy;48 identifiers.  It is the globally unique values
(universal scope) that have the 0x02 bit (also known as the X or
universal/local bit) on in the first octet, while those with this bit
off are typically locally assigned and out of scope for global
assignment. </t>

<t>The X (universal/local) bit was inverted to make it easier for network
operators to type in local-scope identifiers.  Thus, such Modified
EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc. (ignoring leading zeros) are
local.  Without the modification, they would have to be
02-00-00-00-00-00-00-01, 02-00-00-00-00-00-00-02, etc. to be
local.</t>

<t>As with 48-bit MAC identifiers, the M bit (0x01) on in the first
octet indicates a group identifier (multicast or broadcast). </t>

<t>When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified
EUI&nbhy;64 identifier are FF-FE, the remainder of the extension is a
24-bit value, as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI&nbhy;48.  For
example: </t>

<t indent="3">02-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy</t>
<t>or</t>
<t indent="3">03-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy</t>

<t>where yy-yy-yy is the portion (of an EUI&nbhy;48 global unicast or
multicast identifier) that is assigned by the OUI owner (IANA in this
case).  Thus, any holder of one or more EUI&nbhy;48 identifiers under
the IANA OUI also has an equal number of Modified EUI&nbhy;64
identifiers that can be formed by inserting FF-FE in the middle of
their EUI&nbhy;48 identifiers and inverting the universal/local bit.</t>

<t>In addition, certain Modified EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers under the
IANA OUI are reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses as follows:</t>

<t indent="3">02-00-5E-FE-xx-xx-xx-xx</t>

<t>where xx-xx-xx-xx is a 32-bit IPv4 address.  The owner of an IPv4
address has both a unicast- and multicast-derived EUI&nbhy;64 address.
Modified EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers from </t>

<t indent="3">02-00-5E-FE-F0-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FE-FF-FF-FF-FF</t>

<t>are effectively reserved pending the specification of IPv4 "Class
E" addresses <xref target="RFC1112"/>.  However, for Modified
EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers based on an IPv4 address, the universal/local bit
should be set to correspond to whether the IPv4 address is local or
global.  (Keep in mind that the sense of the Modified EUI&nbhy;64
identifier universal/local bit is reversed from that in (unmodified)
EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers.)</t>

<t>The following table shows which Modified EUI&nbhy;64 identifiers
under the IANA OUI are reserved, assigned, or available as indicated.
As noted above, the corresponding MAC addresses can be determined by
complementing the 02 bit in the first octet.  In all cases, the
corresponding multicast 64-bit MAC addresses formed by complementing
the 01 bit in the first octet have the same status as the modified

  <name>Other 48-Bit MAC Identifiers Used by the IETF</name>

<t>There are two other blocks of 48-bit MAC identifiers that are used
by the IETF as described below.</t>

  <section anchor="id-33-33">
    <name>Identifiers with a '33-33' Prefix</name>

<t>All 48-bit multicast MAC identifiers prefixed with "33-33" (that is, the
2**32 multicast MAC identifiers in the range from 33-33-00-00-00-00 to
33-33-FF-FF-FF-FF) are used as specified in <xref target="RFC2464"/>
for IPv6 multicast.  In all of these identifiers, the Group bit (the
bottom bit of the first octet) is on, as is required to work properly
with existing hardware as a multicast identifier.  They also have the
Local bit on, but any Ethernet using standard IPv6 multicast should
note that these addresses will be used for that purpose. These
multicast MAC addresses fall into the Administratively Assigned SLAP
quadrant (see <xref target="first-oct-bit"/>).</t>

<aside>
<t>Historical Notes: It was the custom during IPv6 design
to use "3" for unknown or example values, and 3333 Coyote Hill Road,
Palo Alto, California is the address of PARC (Palo Alto Research
Center), formerly "Xerox PARC."  Ethernet was originally specified by
the Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Xerox
Corporation.  The pre-IEEE <xref target="IEEE.802.3_2012"/> Ethernet
protocol has sometimes been known as "DIX" Ethernet from the first
letters of the names of these companies.</t>
</aside>

  </section>
  <section>

    <name>The CF Series</name>

<t>The Informational <xref target="RFC2153"/> declared the 3-octet
values from CF&nbhy;00&nbhy;00 through CF&nbhy;FF&nbhy;FF to be "OUIs"
available for assignment by IANA to software vendors for use in PPP
<xref target="RFC1661"/> or for other uses where vendors do not
otherwise need an IEEE-assigned OUI. When used as 48-bit MAC prefixes,
these values have all of the Z, Y, X (Local) and M (Group) special
bits at the bottom of the first octet equal to one, while all
IEEE-assigned OUIs thus far have the X and M bits as zero and all CIDs
have the Y and M bits as zero; thus, there can be no conflict between CF
series "OUIs" and IEEE-assigned OUIs/CIDs. Multicast MAC addresses
constructed with a CF series OUI would fall into the Standard
Assigned SLAP quadrant (see <xref target="first-oct-bit"/>). The Group bit is
meaningless in PPP.  To quote <xref target="RFC2153"/>: "The 'CF0000'
series was arbitrarily chosen to match the PPP NLPID 'CF', as a matter
of mnemonic convenience."  (For further information on Network Layer Protocol Identifiers (NLPIDs), see
<xref target="RFC6328"/>.)</t>

<t indent="3">CF&nbhy;00&nbhy;00 is reserved.  CF&nbhy;00&nbhy;00&nbhy;00&nbhy;00&nbhy;00 is a multicast identifier

<t>In over a decade of availability, only a handful of values in the

  <section anchor="cbor-tags">
    <name>CBOR Tags</name>

<t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref
target="RFC8949"/> is a data format whose design goals include the
possibility of very small code size, fairly small message size, and
extensibility. In CBOR, a data item can be enclosed by a CBOR tag to
give it some additional semantics identified by that tag. CBOR-tagged
data items (fields) are not used in actual IEEE 802 address fields but
may be used in CBOR-encoded parts of protocol messages.</t>

<t>IANA has assigned 48 as the CBOR tag to indicate a MAC
address. The enclosed data item is an octet string. The length of the
octet string indicates whether a 48-bit (6 octet) or 64-bit (8 octet) MAC
address is encoded. Should some other multiple of 8 bits be used in the
future for the length of MAC addresses, such as a 128-bit (16-octet) MAC
address, the 48 tag will be used.</t>

<t>IANA has assigned 1048 as the CBOR tag to indicate an OUI, CID, or
CF series organizational identifier. The enclosed data item is an
octet string of length 3 to hold the 24-bit OUI or CID (see <xref target="oui-cid"/>).</t>

  <name>Ethernet Protocol Parameters</name>

<t>Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means of indicating, near
the beginning of a frame, the contents of that frame -- for example,
that it contains IPv4 or IPv6.</t>

<t>There are two types of protocol identifier parameters (see <xref
target="EthernetNum"/>) that can occur in Ethernet frames:</t>

<dl newline="true">
  <dt>EtherTypes:</dt>
  <dd>These are 16-bit identifiers that, when considered as an
  unsigned integer, are equal to or larger than 0x0600. <xref
  target="EtherType"/> shows the simplest case where the EtherType of the
  protocol data in the frame appears immediately after the destination
  and source MAC addresses. <xref target="IEEE802_OandA"/> specifies
  two EtherTypes for local, experimental use: 0x88B5 and 0x88B6.</dd>

  <dt>LSAPs:</dt>
  <dd>These are 8-bit protocol identifiers that occur in pairs after a
  field that gives the frame length. Such a length must, when
  considered as an unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DD, or it could
  be mistaken as an EtherType. However, the LLC encapsulation
  EtherType 0x8870 <xref target="IEEE802.1AC"/> may also be used in
  place of such a length as a "length indication" of nonspecific
  length. LSAPs occur in pairs, where one is intended to indicate the
  source protocol handler (SSAP) and the other the destination protocol
  handler (DSAP); however, use cases where the two are different have
  been relatively rare. See <xref target="LSAP"/> for the simplest
  case where the length field appears immediately after the
  destination and source MAC addresses. In that figure, the CTL
  (control) field value of 3 indicates datagram service. This type of
  protocol identification is sometimes called "LLC" (Logical Link
  Control).</dd>

Ethernet "tags".  An Ethernet tag in this sense is a prefix whose type
is identified by an EtherType that is then followed by either another
tag, an EtherType, or an LLC Link-Layer Service Access Point (LSAP)
protocol indicator for the "main" body of the frame.  Customarily,
in the world of <xref target="IEEE802_OandA"/>, tags are a fixed length
and do not include any encoding of their own length.  An example is
the C-Tag (formerly the Q-Tag) <xref target="IEEE.802.1Q_2014"/>.  It
provides customer VLAN and priority information for a frame. Any
device that is processing a frame cannot, in general, safely process
anything in the frame past an EtherType it does not understand. </t>

<t>Neither EtherTypes nor LSAPs are assigned by IANA; they are
assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority <xref target="IEEE_RA"/>
(see <xref target="IEEEregAuth"/> and <xref target="ethertypes"/>).  However,
both LSAPs and EtherTypes have extension mechanisms so that they can
be used with five-octet Ethernet protocol identifiers under an OUI,
including those assigned by IANA under the IANA OUI.</t>

<t>When using the IEEE 802 Logical Link Control (LLC) format
(Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP)) <xref target="IEEE802_OandA"/> for
a frame, an OUI-based protocol identifier can be expressed as
follows:</t>

<t
indent="3">xx&nbhy;xx&nbhy;AA&nbhy;AA&nbhy;03&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;zz&nbhy;zz
</t>

<t>where xx&nbhy;xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small
enough not to be confused with an EtherType; "AA" is the LSAP that
indicates this use and is sometimes referred to as the SNAP Service
Access Point (SNAP SAP); "03" is the LLC control octet indicating
datagram service; yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy is an OUI; and zz&nbhy;zz is a
protocol number, under that OUI, assigned by the OUI owner.  The
five-octet length for such OUI-based protocol identifiers results,
with the LLC control octet ("0x03"), in the preservation of 16-bit
alignment.</t>

<t>When using an EtherType to indicate the main type for a frame body,
the special "OUI Extended EtherType" 0x88B7 is available.  Using this
EtherType, a frame body can begin with </t>

<t indent="3">88&nbhy;B7&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;zz&nbhy;zz</t>

<t>where yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy and zz&nbhy;zz have the same meaning as in
the SNAP format described above; however, this format with EtherType
0x88B7 does not preserve 16-bit alignment. </t>

<t>It is also possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary
EtherType.  Putting the EtherType as the zz&nbhy;zz field after an
all-zeros OUI (00&nbhy;00&nbhy;00) does this. It looks like </t>

<t
indent="3">xx&nbhy;xx&nbhy;AA&nbhy;AA&nbhy;03&nbhy;00&nbhy;00&nbhy;00&nbhy;zz&nbhy;zz
</t>

<t>where zz&nbhy;zz is the EtherType.</t>

<t>As well as labeling frame contents, IEEE 802 protocol types appear
within Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) Next Hop Resolution Protocol
<xref target="RFC2332"/> messages.  Such messages have provisions for
both two-octet EtherTypes and OUI-based protocol types. 16-bit
EtherTypes also occur in the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) <xref
target="RFC2784"/> header and in the Generic Network
Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) <xref target="RFC8926"/> encapsulation
header.</t>

The extreme values of this range, 00&nbhy;00&nbhy;5E&nbhy;00&nbhy;00
and 00&nbhy;00&nbhy;5E&nbhy;FF&nbhy;FF, are reserved and require IESG
Ratification for assignment (see <xref target="ex-rev-iesg-rat"/>).  New assignments of
protocol numbers (qq&nbhy;qq) under the IANA OUI must meet the
following requirements: </t>

<ul>
  <li>the assignment must be for standards use (either for an IETF
  Standard or other standard related to IETF work), </li>

  <li>the protocol must include a version field at a fixed offset or
  an equivalent marking such that later versions can be indicated in a
  way recognizable by earlier versions, </li>

  <li>the protocol must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC, and </li>

  <li>such protocol numbers are not to be assigned for any protocol
  that has an EtherType. (That EtherType can be used directly, or
   -- in the LSAPs case -- it can be used with the SNAP SAP by putting
   an all-zero "OUI" before the EtherType as described above.)</li>
</ul>

<t>In addition, the Expert Review (or IESG Ratification for the two
reserved values) must be obtained using the procedure specified in

  <name>Other OUI/CID-Based Parameters</name>

<t>Some IEEE 802 and other protocols provide for parameters based on
an OUI or CID beyond those discussed above.  Such parameters commonly
consist of an OUI or CID plus one octet of additional value.  They are
called Organizationally Specific parameters (sometimes informally and
less accurately referred to as "vendor specific").  They would look
like</t>

<t indent="3">yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;zz</t>

<t>where yy&nbhy;yy&nbhy;yy is the OUI/CID and zz is the additional
specifier.  An example is the Cipher Suite Selector in <xref
target="IEEE.802.11_2012"/>.</t>

<t>Values may be assigned under the IANA OUI for other OUI-based
parameter usage by Expert Review, except that, for each use, the
additional specifier values consisting of all zero bits and all one
bits (0x00 (00&nbhy;00&nbhy;5E&nbhy;00) and 0xFF
(00&nbhy;00&nbhy;5E&nbhy;FF) for a one-octet specifier) are reserved
and require IESG Ratification (see <xref target="ex-rev-iesg-rat"/>) for assignment; also,
the additional specifier value 0x42 (00&nbhy;00&nbhy;5E&nbhy;42 for a
one octet specifier, right justified and filled with zeros on the left
if the specifier is more than one octet) is assigned for use as an
example in documentation.</t>

<t>Assignments of other IANA OUI-based parameters must be for
standards use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related
to IETF work) and be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.  The
first time a value is assigned for a particular parameter of this
type, an IANA registry will be created to contain that assignment and
any subsequent assignments of values for that parameter under the IANA
OUI.  The Expert may specify the name of the registry.</t>

<t>If different policies from those above are required for such a
parameter, a BCP or Standards Track RFC should be adopted to update
this BCP and specify the new policy and parameter.</t>

  <name>Expert Review and IESG Ratification</name>

<t>This section specifies the procedures for Expert Review and IESG
Ratification of MAC, protocol, and other IANA OUI-based identifiers.
The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall consist of one or
more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the
IESG. </t>

<section>  <!-- 5.1.1 -->
  <name>Expert Review Guidance</name>
  
<t>The procedure described for Expert Review assignments in this
document is consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy described in
<xref target="RFC8126"/>. </t>

<t>While finite, the universe of MAC code points from which
Expert-judged assignments will be made is considered to be large enough that
the requirements given in this document and the Experts' good judgment
are sufficient guidance.  The idea is for the Expert to provide a
light reasonableness check for small assignments of MAC identifiers, with
increased scrutiny by the Expert for medium-sized assignments of MAC
identifiers and assignments of protocol identifiers and other IANA
OUI-based parameters.</t>

</section>
<section>  <!-- 5.1.2 -->
  <name>Expert Review and IESG Ratification Procedure</name>
  
<t>It can make sense to assign very large portions of the MAC
identifier code point space.  (Note that existing assignments include
one for half of the entire multicast IANA 48&nbhy;bit code point space
and one for a sixteenth of that multicast code point space.)  In those
cases, and in cases of the assignment of "reserved" values, IESG
Ratification of an Expert Review approval recommendation is required
as described below. This can be viewed as a combination of Expert
Review and IESG Approval as defined in <xref target="RFC8126"/>. IESG
Approval is required only when the Expert does not reject the
request. The procedure is as follows: </t>

<t indent="3">The applicant always completes the appropriate template
from <xref target="templates"/> below and sends it to IANA &lt;iana@iana.org&gt;.</t>

<t indent="3">IANA always sends the template to an appointed Expert.
If the Expert recuses themselves or is non-responsive, IANA may choose
an alternative appointed Expert or, if none is available, will contact
the IESG.</t>

<t indent="3">In all cases, if IANA receives a disapproval from an
Expert selected to review an application template, the application
will be denied. The Expert should provide a reason for refusal, which
IANA will communicate back to the applicant.</t>

<t indent="3">If the assignment is based on Expert Review:</t>

<t indent="6">If IANA receives approval and code points are available,
IANA will make the requested assignment.</t>

<t indent="3">If the assignment is based on IESG Ratification:</t>

<t indent="6">The procedure starts with the first steps above for
Expert Review.  If the Expert disapproves the application, they simply
inform IANA, who in turn informs the applicant that their request is
denied; however, if the Expert believes the application should be
approved or is uncertain and believes that the circumstances warrant
the attention of the IESG, the Expert will inform IANA about their
advice, and IANA will forward the application, together with the
reasons provided by the Expert for approval or uncertainty, to the
IESG.  The IESG must decide whether the assignment will be granted.
This can be accomplished by a management item in an IESG telechat, as
is done for other types of requests.  If the IESG decides not to
ratify a favorable opinion by the Expert or decides against an
application where the Expert is uncertain, the application is denied;
otherwise, it is granted.  The IESG will communicate its decision to
the Expert and to IANA. In case of refusal, the IESG should provide a
reason, which IANA will communicate to the applicant.</t>

  <name>EtherType Assignment Process</name>

<t>Applying to the IEEE Registration Authority for an EtherType needed
by an IETF protocol requires IESG Approval, as stated in <xref target="ethertypes"/>. To
minimize confusion, this process will normally be done by the primary
expert for the informational "EtherType" registry within the "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry group, as
described below (see also <xref target="info-iana"/>).</t>

<t>After IESG Approval of the requirement for an EtherType, the IESG
should refer the matter to IANA. In any case, IANA will ask the "EtherType" registry expert to execute the IEEE
Registration Authority <xref target="IEEE_RA"/> EtherType request
process. This path is specified because the IESG usually deals with
IANA for assignment actions and because IANA should be aware of which
"EtherType" registry expert(s) are available,
normally referring the making of the EtherType assignment request to
the primary expert.</t>

<t>Here is sample text for an Internet-Draft where both IANA and IEEE
assignments are required, where "YYY" would be replaced by an
explanation of for what/why the EtherType is needed in whatever level

  <name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>This document is concerned with assignment of IEEE 802 parameters
allocated to IANA, particularly those under the IANA OUI, and closely
related matters.  It is not directly concerned with security except as
follows:</t>

<t indent="3">Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of MAC
addresses or other OUI-derived protocol parameters as examples in
documentation.  Examples that are "only" to be used in documentation
can end up being coded and released or cause conflicts due to later
real use and the possible acquisition of intellectual property rights
in such addresses or parameters.  The reservation herein of MAC
addresses and parameters for documentation purposes will minimize such
confusion and conflict.</t>

<t>MAC addresses are identifiers provided by a device to the
network.  On certain devices, MAC addresses are not static and can be
configured.  The network should exercise caution when using these
addresses to enforce policy because addresses can be spoofed and
previously seen devices can return to the network with a new
address.</t>

<t>MAC addresses identify a physical or virtual interface and can be
used for tracking the device with that interface. Thus, they can be
used to track users associated with that device.  See <xref
target="I-D.ietf-madinas-mac-address-randomization"/> for related privacy considerations and a discussion
of MAC address randomization to partially mitigate this threat.  Also,
see <xref target="RFC7043"/> for the security and privacy
considerations of publishing MAC addresses in DNS.</t>

  <name>EtherTypes</name>

<t>This appendix provides a copy of the IESG Statement issued in May
2023 on obtaining new IETF EtherTypes in <xref target="iesg-ethertypes"/>. Note that there
is an informational IANA registry of some important EtherTypes
specified for IETF protocols or by IEEE 802 available, currently at
<xref target="IANA"/>.  The IEEE Registration Authority page on
EtherTypes <eref target="https://standards.ieee.org/regauth/ethertype/eth.txt" brackets="angle"/> may
also be useful.  See <xref target="eth-pro-param"/> above. </t>

<section anchor="iesg-ethertypes">
  <name>IESG Statement on EtherTypes</name>

<dl newline="false" spacing="compact">
  <dt>From:</dt>
  <dd>IESG</dd>

</dl>

<t>The IEEE Registration Authority (IEEE RA) assigns EtherTypes with
oversight from the IEEE Registration Authority Committee (IEEE RAC).</t>

<t>(See
<eref target="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/regauth/ethertype/"/>.) Some
IETF protocol specifications make use of EtherTypes. All EtherType
applications are subject to IEEE RA technical review for consistency
with policy.</t>

<t>Since EtherTypes are a fairly scarce resource, the IEEE RAC has let
us know that they will not assign a new EtherType to a new IETF
protocol specification until the IESG has approved the protocol
specification for publication as an RFC. In exceptional cases, the
IEEE RA is willing to consider "early allocation" of an EtherType for
an IETF protocol that is still under development as long as the
request comes from and has been vetted by the IESG.</t>

<t>To let the IEEE RAC know that the IESG has approved the request for
an Ethernet assignment for an IETF protocol, all future requests for
assignment of EtherTypes for IETF protocols will be made by the
IESG.</t>

<t>Note that Local Experimental ("playpen") EtherTypes have been
assigned in IEEE 802 [1] use during protocol development and
experimentation.</t>

  <name>Changes from RFC 7042</name>

<t>This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC7042"/> and makes the
changes listed below. However, the completed application template
based upon which an IANA OUI-based protocol number value was assigned
for document use remains that in <xref target="RFC7042" sectionFormat="of" section="C"/>.</t>

<ul>

<li>Add information on MA-M (28-bit) and MA-S (36-bit) EUI prefixes
that the IEEE Registration Authority assigns.</li>

<li>Add information on the restructuring of the "local" MAC address
space into four quadrants under the Structured Local Address Plan
(SLAP) <xref target="IEEE802_OandA"/>.</li>

<li>Include the IESG Statement on EtherTypes (see <xref target="iesg-ethertypes"/>) and
more detailed IETF procedures for applying to the IEEE Registration
Authority for an EtherType for use in an IETF protocol (see <xref target="ethertype-assign-pro"/>). </li>

<li>Mention that IEEE 802 CFM code points have been allocated to
the IETF (see <xref target="CFM"/>).</li>

<li>Mention the Organizationally Specific LLDP data element that has
been assigned under the IANA OUI and the registry set up for future
such assignments (see <xref target="lldp-ietf-tlv"/>).</li>

<li>Clarify minor details in <xref target="ex-rev-iesg-rat"/> on Expert Review and IESG
Ratification.</li>

<li>Specify CBOR tags for MAC addresses and OUIs/CIDs (see
<xref target="cbor-tags"/>).</li>

<li>Add a version field requirement for the allocation of protocol
numbers under the IANA OUI (see <xref target="eth-pro-iana-oui"/>).</li>

<li>Mention that EtherTypes are used in the Geneve <xref
target="RFC8926"/> encapsulation header (see <xref target="eth-pro-param"/>).</li>

<li>Add "a combination of Expert Review and IESG Approval" as part of
the specification for "IESG Ratification".</li>
