    <abstract><t>This specification extends the Internet Message Access
    Protocol, specifically IMAP4rev1 (RFC 3501), to support UTF-8 encoded international
    characters in user names, mail addresses, and message headers.  This
    specification replaces RFC 6855. This specification does not extend

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This specification forms part of the Email Address
Internationalization protocols described in the Email Address
Internationalization Framework document <xref target="RFC6530"/>.  It extends IMAP
<xref target="RFC3501"/> to permit UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/> in headers, as described in
"Internationalized Email Headers" <xref target="RFC6532"/>.  It also adds a
mechanism to support mailbox names using the UTF-8 charset.  This
specification creates two new IMAP capabilities to allow servers to
advertise these new extensions.</t>
      <t>This specification assumes that the IMAP server will be operating in
a fully internationalized environment, i.e., one in which all clients
accessing the server will be able to accept non-ASCII message header
fields and other information, as specified in <xref target="utf8accept-imap-capability-and-utf-8-in-imap-quoted-strings"/>.  At least
during a transition period, that assumption will not be realistic for
many environments; the issues involved are discussed in <xref target="utf8only-capability"/>
below.</t>
      <t>This specification replaces an earlier, experimental approach to the
same problem; see <xref target="RFC5738"/> as well as <xref target="RFC6855"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="utf8accept-imap-capability-and-utf-8-in-imap-quoted-strings">
      <name>"UTF8=ACCEPT" IMAP Capability and UTF-8 in IMAP Quoted-Strings</name>
      <t>The "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability indicates that the server supports the
ability to open mailboxes containing internationalized messages with
the "SELECT" and "EXAMINE" commands, and the server can provide UTF-8
responses to the "LIST" and "LSUB" commands.  This capability also
affects other IMAP extensions that can return mailbox names or their
prefixes, such as NAMESPACE <xref target="RFC2342"/> and ACL <xref target="RFC4314"/>.</t>
      <t>The "UTF8=ONLY" capability, described in <xref target="utf8only-capability"/>, implies the
"UTF8=ACCEPT" capability.  A server is said to support "UTF8=ACCEPT"
if it advertises either "UTF8=ACCEPT" or "UTF8=ONLY".</t>
      <t>A client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the "ENABLE" command <xref target="RFC5161"/> with the
"UTF8=ACCEPT" option (defined in <xref target="append-command"/> below) to indicate to the
server that the client accepts UTF-8 in quoted-strings and supports
the "UTF8=ACCEPT" extension.  The "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command is
only valid in the authenticated state.</t>
      <t>The IMAP base specification <xref target="RFC3501"/> forbids the use of 8-bit
characters in atoms or quoted-strings.  Thus, a UTF-8 string can only
be sent as a literal.  This can be inconvenient from a coding
standpoint, and unless the server offers IMAP non-synchronizing
literals <xref target="RFC7888"/>, this requires an extra round trip for each UTF-8
string sent by the client.  When the IMAP server supports
"UTF8=ACCEPT", it supports UTF-8 in quoted-strings with the following ABNF
syntax <xref target="RFC5234"/>:</t>

<sourcecode type="abnf"><![CDATA[
      quoted        =/ DQUOTE *uQUOTED-CHAR DQUOTE
             ; QUOTED-CHAR is not modified, as it will affect
             ; other RFC 3501 ABNF non-terminals.

      uQUOTED-CHAR  = QUOTED-CHAR / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

      UTF8-2        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>

      UTF8-3        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>

      UTF8-4        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>
]]></sourcecode>

      <t>When this extended quoting mechanism is used by the client, the
server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject, with a "BAD" response, any octet sequences with
the high bit set that fail to comply with the formal syntax
requirements of UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/>.  The IMAP server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send UTF-8
in quoted-strings to the client unless the client has indicated
support for that syntax by using the "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command.</t>
      <t>If the server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT", the client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use extended
quoted syntax with any IMAP argument that permits a string (including
astring and nstring).  However, if characters outside the US-ASCII
repertoire are used in an inappropriate place, the results would be
the same as if other syntactically valid but semantically invalid
characters were used.  Specific cases where UTF-8 characters are
permitted or not permitted are described in the following paragraphs.</t>
      <t>
  All IMAP servers that support "UTF8=ACCEPT" <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> accept UTF-8 in
  mailbox names, and those that also support the Mailbox International
  Naming Convention described in <xref section="5.1.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC3501"/>, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> accept
  UTF-8 in mailbox names and convert them to the appropriate
  internal format.
 Mailbox names <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> comply with the Net-Unicode
Definition (<xref section="2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC5198"/>) with the specific exception that
they <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain control characters (U+0000 - U+001F and U+0080 - U+009F), a delete character (U+007F), a line separator (U+2028), or a
paragraph separator (U+2029).</t>
<t>
   Once an IMAP client has enabled UTF-8 support with the "ENABLE
   UTF8=ACCEPT" command, it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> issue a "SEARCH" command that
   contains a charset specification. If an IMAP server receives such a
   "SEARCH" command in that situation, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> reject the command with
   a "BAD" response (due to the conflicting charset labels). This also
   applies to any IMAP command or extension that includes an optional
   charset label and associated strings in the command arguments,
   including the MULTISEARCH extension. For commands with a mandatory
   charset field, such as SORT and THREAD, servers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> reject charset
   values other than UTF-8 with a "BAD" response (due to the conflicting
   charset labels).
 </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="append-command">
      <name>"APPEND" Command</name>
      <t>If the server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT", then the server accepts UTF-8
headers in the "APPEND" command message argument.</t>
      <t>If an IMAP server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT" and the IMAP client has not
issued the "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject, with
a "NO" response, an "APPEND" command that includes any 8-bit
character in message header fields.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="login-command-and-utf-8">
      <name>"LOGIN" Command and UTF-8</name>
      <t>This specification does not extend the IMAP "LOGIN" command <xref target="RFC3501"/>
to support UTF-8 usernames and passwords.  Whenever a client needs to
use UTF-8 usernames or passwords, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the IMAP "AUTHENTICATE"
command, which is already capable of passing UTF-8 usernames and
credentials.</t>
      <t>Although using the IMAP "AUTHENTICATE" command in this way makes it
syntactically legal to have a UTF-8 username or password, there is no
guarantee that the user provisioning system utilized by the IMAP
server will allow such identities.  This is an implementation
decision and may depend on what identity system the IMAP server is
configured to use.</t>

    <section anchor="fetch-bodystructure-and-messageglobal">
      <name>FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE and message/global</name>
      <t><xref section="7.5.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9051"/> treats message/global like message/rfc,
which means that for some messages, the response to FETCH
BODYSTRUCTURE varies depending on whether IMAP4rev1 or IMAP4rev2 is
in use.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC6855"/> does not extend <xref target="RFC3501"/> in this respect. This document
extends the media-message ABNF production to match <xref target="RFC9051"/>.</t>

                        DQUOTE ("RFC822" / "GLOBAL") DQUOTE
]]></sourcecode>

      <t>When IMAP4rev1 and UTF8=ACCEPT has been enabled, the server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> treat
message/global like message/rfc822 when computing the body structure,
but <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also treat it as described in <xref target="RFC3501"/>. Clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> accept
both cases.</t>
      <t>When IMAP4rev2 and UTF8=ACCEPT are in use, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> behave as
described in <xref target="RFC9051"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="utf8only-capability">
      <name>"UTF8=ONLY" Capability</name>
      <t>The "UTF8=ONLY" capability indicates that the server supports
"UTF8=ACCEPT" (see <xref target="utf8accept-imap-capability-and-utf-8-in-imap-quoted-strings"/>) and that it requires support for UTF-8
from clients.  In particular, this means that the server will send
UTF-8 in quoted-strings, and it will not accept the older
international mailbox name convention (modified UTF-7 <xref target="RFC3501"/>).
Because these are incompatible changes to IMAP, explicit server
announcement and client confirmation are necessary: clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use
the "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command before using this server.  A server
that advertises "UTF8=ONLY" will reject, with a "NO [CANNOT]"
response <xref target="RFC5530"/>, any command that might require UTF-8 support and
is not preceded by an "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command.</t>
      <t>IMAP clients that find support for a server that announces
"UTF8=ONLY" problematic are encouraged to at least detect the
announcement and provide an informative error message to the
end user.</t>
      <t>Because the "UTF8=ONLY" server capability includes support for
"UTF8=ACCEPT", the capability string will include, at most, one of
those and never both.  For the client, "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" is always
used -- never "ENABLE UTF8=ONLY".</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="dealing-with-legacy-clients">
      <name>Dealing with Legacy Clients</name>
      <t>In most situations, it will be difficult or impossible for the
implementer or operator of an IMAP (or POP) server to know whether
all of the clients that might access it, or the associated mail store
more generally, will be able to support the facilities defined in
this document.  In almost all cases, servers that conform to this
specification will have to be prepared to deal with clients that do
not enable the relevant capabilities.  Unfortunately, there is no
completely satisfactory way to do so other than for systems that wish
to receive email that requires SMTPUTF8 capabilities to be sure that
all components of those systems -- including IMAP and other clients
selected by users -- are upgraded appropriately.</t>
      <t>When a message that requires SMTPUTF8 is encountered and the client
does not enable UTF-8 capability, choices available to the server
include hiding the problematic message(s), creating in-band or
out-of-band notifications or error messages, or somehow trying to
create a surrogate of the message with the intention of providing
useful information to that client about what has occurred.  Such
surrogate messages cannot be actual substitutes for the original
message: they will almost always be impossible to reply to (either at
all or without loss of information) and the new header fields or
specialized constructs for server-client communications may go beyond
the requirements of current email specifications (e.g., <xref target="RFC5322"/>).
Consequently, such messages may confuse some legacy mail user agents
(including IMAP clients) or not provide expected information to
users.  There are also trade-offs in constructing surrogates of the
original message between accepting complexity and additional
computation costs in order to try to preserve as much information as
possible (for example, in "Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for
Internationalized Email Messages" <xref target="RFC6857"/>) and trying to minimize
those costs while still providing useful information (for example, in
"Simplified POP and IMAP Downgrading for Internationalized Email"
<xref target="RFC6858"/>).</t>
      <t>Implementations that choose to perform downgrading <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use one of
the standardized algorithms provided in <xref target="RFC6857"/> or <xref target="RFC6858"/>.
Getting downgrade algorithms right, and minimizing the risk of
operational problems and harm to the email system, is tricky and
requires careful engineering.  These two algorithms are well
understood and carefully designed.</t>
      <t>Because such messages are really surrogates of the original ones, not
really "downgraded" ones (although that terminology is often used for
convenience), they inevitably have relationships to the originals
that the IMAP specification <xref target="RFC3501"/> did not anticipate.  This
brings up two concerns in particular: First, digital signatures
computed over and intended for the original message will often not be
applicable to the surrogate message, and will often fail signature
verification.  (It will be possible for some digital signatures to be
verified, if they cover only parts of the original message that are
not affected in the creation of the surrogate.)  Second, servers that
may be accessed by the same user with different clients or methods
(e.g., POP or webmail systems in addition to IMAP or IMAP clients
with different capabilities) will need to exert extreme care to be
sure that UIDVALIDITY <xref target="RFC3501"/> behaves as the user would expect.
Those issues may be especially sensitive if the server caches the
surrogate message or computes and stores it when the message arrives
with the intent of making either form available depending on client
capabilities.  Additionally, in order to cope with the case when a
server compliant with this extension returns the same UIDVALIDITY to
both legacy and "UTF8=ACCEPT"-aware clients, a client upgraded from
being non-"UTF8=ACCEPT"-aware <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> discard its cache of messages
downloaded from the server.</t>
      <t>The best (or "least bad") approach for any given environment will
depend on local conditions, local assumptions about user behavior,
the degree of control the server operator has over client usage and
upgrading, the options that are actually available, and so on.  It is
impossible, at least at the time of publication of this
specification, to give good advice that will apply to all situations,
or even particular profiles of situations, other than "upgrade legacy
clients as soon as possible".</t>

    <section anchor="issues-with-utf-8-header-mailstore">
      <name>Issues with UTF-8 Header Mailstore</name>
      <t>When an IMAP server uses a mailbox format that supports UTF-8 headers
and it permits selection or examination of that mailbox without
issuing "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" first, it is the responsibility of the
server to comply with the IMAP base specification <xref target="RFC3501"/> and the

<section anchor="design-rationale">
      <name>Design Rationale</name>
      <t>This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the
design choices in this specification.</t>
      <t>The "UTF8=ONLY" mechanism simplifies diagnosis of interoperability
problems when legacy support goes away.  In the situation where
backwards compatibility is not working anyway, the non-conforming
"just-send-UTF-8 IMAP" has the advantage that it might work with some
legacy clients.  However, the difficulty of diagnosing
interoperability problems caused by a "just-send-UTF-8 IMAP" mechanism
is the reason the "UTF8=ONLY" capability mechanism was chosen.</t>

      <section anchor="append-utf8">
        <name>APPEND UTF8</name>
        <t>This document removes APPEND's UTF8 data item, making the UTF8-related
syntax compatible with IMAP4rev2 as defined by <xref target="RFC9051"/> and making
it simpler for clients to support IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 with the
same code.</t>
        <t>IMAP4rev2 <xref target="RFC9051"/> provides roughly the same abilities as
<xref target="RFC6855"/> but does not include APPEND's UTF8 item. None of
<xref target="RFC6855"/>, IMAP4rev2, or JMAP <xref target="RFC8620"/> specify any way to learn
whether a particular message was stored using the UTF8 data item. As
of today, an IMAP client cannot learn whether a particular message was
stored using the UTF8 data item, nor would it be able to trust that
information even if IMAP4rev1 and 2 were extended to provide that
information.</t>
        <t>In July 2023, one of the authors found only one IMAP client that uses
the UTF8 data item, and that client uses it incorrectly (it sends the
data item for all messages if the server supports UTF8=ACCEPT, without
regard to whether a particular message includes any UTF8 at all).</t>
        <t>For these reasons, it was judged best to revise <xref target="RFC6855"/> and adopt
the same syntax as IMAP4rev2.</t>

substantially like message/rfc822 except that the submessage may
(also) use the syntax defined in <xref target="RFC6532"/>. <xref target="RFC3501"/> and
<xref target="RFC9051"/> define a FETCH item to return the MIME structure of a message, which servers usually compute once and store.</t>
        <t>None of the RFCs point out to implementers that IMAP4rev1 and
IMAP4rev2 are slightly different, so storing the BODYSTRUCTURE in the
way servers and clients often do can easily lead to problems.</t>
        <t>This document makes the syntax optional, making it simple for server
authors to implement this extension correctly. This implies that
clients need to parse and handle both varieties, which they need to do
anyway if they want to support both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2.</t>
