      <t>Extensions have been defined for link-state routing protocols that
      enable distribution of application-specific link attributes for existing
      as well as newer applications such as Segment Routing (SR). This document
      defines extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) to enable the advertisement of these
      application-specific attributes as a part of the topology information
      from the network.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/> enables the distribution of
      the link-state topology information from link-state routing protocols
      (viz., IS-IS <xref target="RFC1195" format="default"/>, OSPFv2 <xref target="RFC2328" format="default"/>,
      and OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5340" format="default"/>) to an application like a controller
      or Path Computation Engine (PCE) via BGP. The controller or PCE gets the
      end-to-end topology information across IGP domains so it can perform
      path computations for use cases like end-to-end traffic engineering
      (TE).</t>

      <t>The link-state topology information distributed via BGP-LS includes
      link attributes that were originally defined for MPLS TE (i.e., using RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209" format="default"/> or GMPLS <xref target="RFC4202" format="default"/> applications). In recent years, applications,
      such as Segment Routing (SR) Policy <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/> and
      Loop-Free Alternates (LFA) <xref target="RFC5286" format="default"/>, which also make use
      of link attributes, have been introduced. <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/> and
      <xref target="RFC8920" format="default"/> define extensions for IS-IS and OSPF,
      respectively, that enable advertising application-specific link
      attributes for these and other future applications. This has resulted in
      the need for a similar BGP-LS extension to include this additional
      link-state topology information from the link-state routing
      protocols.</t>
      <t>This document defines the BGP-LS extensions for the advertisement of
      application-specific link attributes. It describes the advertisement of
      these link attributes as top-level TLVs (i.e., as TLVs of the BGP-LS
      Attribute) and as sub-TLVs of the (top-level) Application-Specific Link
      Attributes (ASLA) TLV. The document also describes the procedures for the
      advertisement of these attributes from the underlying IGPs and discusses
      their deployment aspects.</t>

      <t>BGP-LS <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/> specifies the Link Network Layer
      Reachability Information (NLRI) for the advertisement of links and their
      attributes using the BGP-LS Attribute. The ASLA TLV is an optional top-level BGP-LS Attribute TLV that
      is introduced for Link NLRIs. It is defined such that it may act as a
      container for certain existing and future link attributes that require
      application-specific definition.</t>
      <t>The format of this TLV is as follows and is similar to the
      corresponding ASLA sub-TLVs defined for OSPF and IS-IS in <xref target="RFC8920" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/>, respectively.</t>

      <t>The BGP-LS originator learns of the association of an
      application-specific attribute to one or more applications from the
      underlying IGP protocol Link State Advertisements (LSAs) or Link State Packets (LSPs) from which it is advertising the
      topology information. <xref target="RFC8920" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/> specify the mechanisms for advertising
      application-specific link attributes in OSPF and IS-IS, respectively.</t>
      <t>Application-specific link attributes received from an IGP node
      without the use of ASLA encodings continue to be encoded using the
      respective BGP-LS top-level TLVs listed in <xref target="APPSPECATTR" format="default"/>
      as specified in their respective reference documents.</t>
      <t>While the ASLA encoding in OSPF is similar to that of BGP-LS, the
      encoding in IS-IS differs and requires additional procedures when
      conveying information into BGP-LS. One of these differences arises from
      the presence of the L-flag in the IS-IS encoding. Another difference
      arises due to the requirement to collate information from two types of
      IS-IS encodings for application-specific link information (i.e., the
      IS-IS ASLA sub-TLV and the IS-IS Application-Specific Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) TLV) <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/> and to carry them together in the BGP-LS ASLA
      TLV.</t>
      <t>A BGP-LS originator node that is advertising link-state information
      from the underlying IGP using ASLA encodings determines their BGP-LS
      encoding based on the following rules:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Application-specific link attributes received from an OSPF node
          using an ASLA sub-TLV or from an IS-IS node using either an ASLA sub-TLV
          or an Application-Specific SRLG TLV <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be encoded in the BGP-LS ASLA
          TLV as sub-TLVs. Exceptions to this rule are specified in (2)(F) and
          (2)(G) below.</li>
        <li>
          <t>In the case of IS-IS, the specific procedures below are to be
          followed:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="A"><li>When application-specific link attributes are received from a
              node with the L-flag set in the IS-IS ASLA sub-TLV and when
              application bits (other than RSVP-TE) are set in the application
              bit masks, then the application-specific link attributes
              advertised in the corresponding legacy IS-IS TLVs and sub-TLVs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
              be encoded within the BGP-LS ASLA TLV as sub-TLVs with the
              application bits (other than the RSVP-TE bit) copied from the
              IS-IS ASLA sub-TLV. The link attributes advertised in the legacy
              IS-IS TLVs and sub-TLVs are also advertised in BGP-LS top-level TLVs
              as per <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8571" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC9104" format="default"/>. The same procedure also applies for the
              advertisement of the SRLG values from the IS-IS
              Application-Specific SRLG TLV.</li>
            <li>When the IS-IS ASLA sub-TLV has the RSVP-TE application bit
              set, then the link attributes for the corresponding IS-IS ASLA
              sub-TLVs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be encoded using the respective BGP-LS top-level
              TLVs as per <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8571" format="default"/>, and
              <xref target="RFC9104" format="default"/>. Similarly, when the IS-IS
              Application-Specific SRLG TLV has the RSVP-TE application bit
              set, then the SRLG values within it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be encoded using the

              <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/> allows the advertisement of the
              Maximum Link Bandwidth within an IS-IS ASLA sub-TLV even though
              it is not an application-specific attribute. However, when
              originating the Maximum Link Bandwidth into BGP-LS, the
              attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be encoded only in the top-level BGP-LS Maximum
              Link Bandwidth TLV (1089) and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be advertised within the
              BGP-LS ASLA TLV.</li>
            <li>
              <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/> also allows the advertisement of the
              Maximum Reservable Link Bandwidth and the Unreserved Bandwidth
              within an IS-IS ASLA sub-TLV even though these attributes are
              specific to RSVP-TE application. However, when originating the
              Maximum Reservable Link Bandwidth and Unreserved Bandwidth into
              BGP-LS, these attributes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be encoded only in the BGP-LS
              top-level Maximum Reservable Link Bandwidth TLV (1090) and
              Unreserved Bandwidth TLV (1091), respectively, and not within the
              BGP-LS ASLA TLV.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <t>These rules ensure that a BGP-LS originator performs the
      advertisement for all application-specific link attributes from the IGP
      nodes that support the ASLA extension. Furthermore, it also ensures that
      the top-level BGP-LS TLVs defined for RSVP-TE and GMPLS applications
      continue to be used for advertisement of their application-specific
      attributes.</t>
      <t>A BGP-LS speaker would normally advertise all the
      application-specific link attributes corresponding to RSVP-TE and GMPLS
      applications as existing top-level BGP-LS TLVs while for other
      applications they are encoded in the ASLA TLV(s) with appropriate applicable
      bit mask setting. An application-specific attribute value received via a
      sub-TLV within the ASLA TLV has precedence over the value received via a
      top-level TLV.</t>
      <section anchor="EXAMPLE" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Illustration for IS-IS</name>
        <t>This section illustrates the procedure for the advertisement of
        application-specific link attributes from IS-IS into BGP-LS.</t>
        <t>Consider the following advertisements for a link in IS-IS. We start
        with this set:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="a"><li>IS-IS ASLA sub-TLV with the S, F, and X bits set on it that carries
            certain application-specific link attributes</li>
          <li>IS-IS Application-Specific SRLG TLV with zero-length bit
            masks with a set of application-specific SRLGs</li>
          <li>IS-IS Application-Specific SRLG TLV with the X bit set on it
            with a set of application-specific SRLGs</li>
        </ol>
        <t>The corresponding BGP-LS advertisements for that link are
        determined as follows:</t>
        <t>First, based on rule (1), the advertisements are conveyed to BGP-LS
        to get the following "updated set":</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>ASLA with the S, F, and X bits set on it that carries link attributes
            from IS-IS advertisement (a)</li>
          <li>ASLA SRLG with zero-length bit masks with a set of SRLGs from
            IS-IS advertisement (b)</li>
          <li>ASLA SRLG with the X bit set on it with a set of SRLGs from
            IS-IS advertisement (c)</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Next, we apply the rules from (2) to this "updated set", because
        all of them were sourced from IS-IS, to derive a new set.</t>
        <t>The next rule that applies is (2)(c), and it is determined that
        collation is required for applications S and F; therefore, we get the
        following "final set":</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>ASLA with the S bit set on it that carries link attributes from
            IS-IS advertisement (a) and SRLGs from IS-IS advertisement (b)
            (this is collation for application S based on (2)(c))</li>
          <li>ASLA with the F bit set on it that carries link attributes from
            IS-IS advertisement (a) and SRLGs from IS-IS advertisement (b)
            (this is collation for application F based on (2)(c))</li>
          <li>ASLA with the X bit set on it that carries link attributes from
            IS-IS advertisement (a) (remaining application not affected by
            collation based on (2)(c))</li>
          <li>ASLA with zero-length bit masks with SRLGs from IS-IS
            advertisement (b) (not affected by (2)(c) and therefore carried
            forward unchanged from the "updated set")</li>
          <li>ASLA with the X bit set on it with SRLGs from IS-IS
            advertisement (c) (not affected by (2)(c) and therefore carried
            forward unchanged from the "updated set")</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Implementations may optionally perform further consolidation by
        processing the "final set" above based on (2)(d) to determine the
        following "consolidated final set":</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>ASLA with the S and F bits set on it that carries application-specific
            link attributes from IS-IS advertisement (a) and SRLGs from IS-IS
            advertisement (b) (this is the consolidation of items 1 and 2 of
            the "final set" based on (2)(d))</li>
          <li>ASLA with the X bit set on it that carries certain
            application-specific link attributes from IS-IS advertisement (a)
            (it is unaffected by this consolidation)</li>
          <li>ASLA with zero-length bit masks with a set of
            application-specific SRLGs from IS-IS advertisement (b) (this is
            retained based on (2)(e) and is unaffected by any further
            consolidation)</li>
          <li>ASLA with the X bit set on it with a set of
            application-specific SRLGs from IS-IS advertisement (c) (it is
            unaffected by this consolidation)</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Further optimization (e.g., combining (2) and (4) from the
        "consolidated final set" above into a single BGP-LS ASLA TLV) may be
        possible while ensuring that the semantics are preserved between the
        IS-IS and BGP-LS advertisements. Such optimizations are outside the
        scope of this document.</t>

      <t>BGP-LS sources the link-state topology information (including the
      extensions introduced by this document) from the underlying link-state
      IGP protocols. The various deployment aspects related to the
      advertisement and use of application-specific link attributes are
      discussed in the Deployment Considerations sections of <xref target="RFC8920" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/>. The IGP backward-compatibility aspects
      described in those documents associated with
      application-specific link attributes along with the BGP-LS procedures
      specified in this document enable backward compatibility in deployments
      of existing implementations of <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8571" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC9104" format="default"/> for applications such as
      RSVP-TE, SR Policy, and LFA.</t>
      <t>It is recommended that only nodes supporting this specification are
      selected as originators of BGP-LS information when advertising the
      link-state information from the IGPs in deployments supporting
      application-specific link attributes.</t>
      <t>BGP-LS consumers that do not support this specification can continue
      to use the existing top-level TLVs for link attributes for existing
      applications as discussed above. However, they would be able to support
      neither the application-specific link attributes nor newer applications
      that may be encoded only using the ASLA TLV.</t>

      <t>The protocol extensions introduced in this document augment the
      existing IGP topology information defined in <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/>.
      Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
      affect the BGP protocol operations and management other than as
      discussed in the Manageability Considerations section of <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/>. Specifically, the malformed NLRI attribute tests in
      the Fault Management section of <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/> now encompass
      the BGP-LS TLVs defined in this document.</t>
      <t>The extensions specified in this document do not specify any new
      configuration or monitoring aspects in BGP or BGP-LS. The specification
      of BGP models is an ongoing work based on <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>Security considerations for acquiring and distributing BGP-LS
      information are discussed in <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/>. Specifically, the
      considerations related to topology information, which are related to traffic engineering, apply.</t>
      <t>The TLVs introduced in this document are used to propagate the
      application-specific link attributes IGP extensions defined in <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8920" format="default"/>. It is assumed that the
      IGP instances originating these TLVs will support all the required
      security (as described in <xref target="RFC8919" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8920" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>This document defines a new way to advertise link attributes.
      Tampering with the information defined in this document may affect
      applications using it, including impacting traffic engineering, which
      uses various link attributes for its path computation. As the
      advertisements defined in this document limit the scope to specific
      applications, the impact of tampering is similarly limited in scope. The
      advertisement of the link attribute information defined in this document
      presents no significant additional risk beyond that associated with the
      existing link attribute information already supported in <xref target="RFC7752" format="default"/>.</t>
