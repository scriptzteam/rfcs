      <name>The PARTIAL Extension</name>
      <t>An IMAP server advertises support for the PARTIAL extension
        by including the "PARTIAL" capability in the CAPABILITY response / response code.</t>
      <section anchor="partial-def" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Incremental SEARCH and Partial Results</name>
        <t>
      The PARTIAL SEARCH return option causes the server to provide in an
      ESEARCH response <xref target="RFC4731" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC9051" format="default"/> a subset of the results denoted by the sequence
      range given as the mandatory argument.
      The first result (message with the lowest matching Unique
   Identifier (UID)) is 1;
      thus, the first 500 results would be obtained by a return option of
      "PARTIAL 1:500" and the second 500 by "PARTIAL 501:1000".  This
      intentionally mirrors message sequence numbers.
        </t>
        <t>
      It is also possible to direct the server to start the SEARCH from the latest
      matching (with the highest UID) message. This can be done by prepending "-"
      to the index. For example, -1 is the last message, -2 is next to the last, and so on.
      Using this syntax helps server implementations to optimize their SEARCHes.
        </t>
        <t>
      A single command <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain more than one PARTIAL or ALL search
      return option; that is, either one PARTIAL, one ALL, or neither
      PARTIAL nor ALL is allowed.
        </t>
        <t>
      For SEARCH results, the entire list of results <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ordered in mailbox
      order -- that is, in UID or message sequence number order.
        </t>
        <t>
      In cases where a PARTIAL SEARCH return option references results that do not
      exist by using a range that starts or ends higher (or lower) than the current
      number of results, the server returns the results that are in
      the set.  This yields a PARTIAL return data item that has, as
      payload, the original range and a potentially missing set of results
      that may be shorter than the extent of the range.
      If the whole range references results that do not exist,
      a special value "NIL" is returned by the server instead of the sequence set.
        </t>
        <t>
      Clients need not request PARTIAL results in any particular order.
      Because mailboxes may change, clients might wish to use PARTIAL
      in combination with UPDATE (see <xref target="RFC5267" format="default"/>) if the server
      also advertises the "CONTEXT=SEARCH" capability, especially if the intent is to walk a
      large set of results; however, these return options do not interact
      -- the UPDATE will provide notifications for all matching results.

        <name>Interaction between PARTIAL, MIN, MAX, and SAVE SEARCH Return Options</name>
        <t>This section only applies if the server advertises the "PARTIAL" IMAP capability or "CONTEXT=SEARCH" <xref target="RFC5267" format="default"/>,
      together with "ESEARCH" <xref target="RFC4731" format="default"/> and/or IMAP4rev2 <xref target="RFC9051" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
      The SAVE result option doesn't change whether the server would return
      items corresponding to PARTIAL SEARCH result options.
        </t>
        <t>
      As specified in <xref target="partial-def" format="default"/>, it is an error to specify both the
      PARTIAL and ALL result options in the same SEARCH command.
        </t>
        <t>
      When the SAVE result option is combined with the PARTIAL
      result option and none of the MIN/MAX/COUNT result options are
      present, the corresponding PARTIAL is returned,
      and the "$" marker would contain references to all
      messages returned by the PARTIAL result option.
        </t>
        <t>
      When the SAVE and PARTIAL result options are combined with the MIN or MAX
      result option and the COUNT result option is
      absent, the corresponding PARTIAL result and MIN/MAX are returned (if the SEARCH result
      is not empty), and the "$" marker would contain references to all
      messages returned by the PARTIAL result option together with the corresponding MIN/MAX message.
        </t>
        <t>
      If the SAVE and PARTIAL result options are combined with both the MIN and MAX result
      options and the COUNT result option is absent,
      the PARTIAL, MIN, and MAX result options are returned (if the SEARCH result is not empty),
      and the "$" marker would contain references to all
      messages returned by the PARTIAL result option together with the MIN and MAX messages.
        </t>
        <t>
      If the SAVE and PARTIAL result options are combined with the COUNT
      result option, the PARTIAL and COUNT result options are returned,
      and the "$" marker would always contain references to all messages
      found by the SEARCH or UID SEARCH command.

        <t>The PARTIAL extension also extends the UID FETCH command with a PARTIAL FETCH modifier.

      The presence of the PARTIAL FETCH modifier instructs the server to only return FETCH results

      This document defines an additional IMAP4 capability.  As such, it

<xref target="RFC3501" format="default"/> and IMAP4rev2 <xref target="RFC9051" format="default"/>.

      <t>
      This document defines an optimization that can reduce both the amount of work
      performed by the server and the amount of data returned to the client.
      Use of this extension is likely to cause the server and the client to use less memory
      than when the extension is not used. However, as this is going
      to be new code in both the client and the server, rigorous testing of such code
      is required in order to avoid introducing new implementation bugs.
