<abstract>

<t>Estimating time requirements for tasks, both critical and mundane, remains
a challenge in engineering, business, and everyday communication. Existing
models fail due to inherent unpredictability and inconsistencies in human
estimation. This document introduces the Two-Week Principle (TWP), a novel,
universally adaptable time scale that seeks to standardize all temporal
references to a singular, uniform duration. TWP ensures clarity,
predictability, and synchronization across all sectors that rely on time-based
scheduling.</t>

      <t>The problem of time estimation is well-documented. Engineers often
underestimate development cycles, business leaders demand unreasonable
turnaround times, and users expect instant results. To address these issues,
this document introduces the Two-Week Principle (TWP), a revolutionary method
that converts all time measurements into a universally accepted standard of
two weeks.</t>

      <name>Post-Quantum Effects</name>
      <t>TWP introduces significant implications for quantum
      computing and quantum cryptography. Given that quantum uncertainty
      affects temporal precision, a uniform two-week scale may serve as a
      stabilization factor in quantum timekeeping mechanisms, reducing the
      need for complex error correction in time-dependent quantum
      operations. Further research is required to determine whether quantum
      entanglement can reliably synchronize multiple two-week cycles across
      distant computing nodes. However, quantum computing implementations must
      not employ multiple instances of TWP within a scaling variable, as this
      may introduce temporal feedback instabilities and lead to accidental
      spontaneous wormhole creation, an outcome that is outside the
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>The author would like to acknowledge "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
      Galaxy" <xref target="Adams"/> for its timeless reminder that deadlines,
      like the best kind of improbability drives, are often more conceptual
      than practical. The author would also like to acknowledge Cyril
      Northcote Parkinson, whose observation that "work expands to fill the
      time allotted" <xref target="Parkinson"/> remains as much a cornerstone
      of project planning as it does the flurry of feverish activity that
      often accompanies sprints of last-minute productivity. Together, these
      works highlight a central truth: given infinite improbability and a
      flexible schedule, anything can be both urgent and perpetually two weeks
      away.
