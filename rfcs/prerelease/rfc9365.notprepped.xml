      <t>
    This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of 
    IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). 
    The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),
    vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. 
    First, this document explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.
    Next, for IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current 
    IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, mobility management, as well as
    security and privacy).

      <t>
    Vehicular networking studies have mainly focused on improving road 
    safety and efficiency and also enabling entertainment in vehicular 
    networks. To proliferate the use cases of vehicular networks, 
    several governments and private organizations have committed to 
    allocating dedicated spectrum for vehicular communications. 
    The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US allocated wireless
    channels for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) <xref target="DSRC" format="default"/> 
    in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) with the frequency band of 
    5.850 - 5.925 GHz (i.e., 5.9 GHz band). In November 2020, the FCC adjusted 
    the lower 45 MHz (i.e., 5.850 - 5.895 GHz) of the 5.9 GHz band for 
    unlicensed use instead of DSRC-dedicated use 
    <xref target="FCC-ITS-Modification" format="default"/>. DSRC-based wireless communications
    can support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),
    and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networking.
    The European Union (EU) allocated radio spectrum for safety-related and 
    non-safety-related applications of ITS with the frequency band of 
    5.875 - 5.905 GHz, as part of the Commission Decision 2008/671/EC
    <xref target="EU-2008-671-EC" format="default"/>. Most other countries and regions in
    the world have adopted the 5.9 GHz band for vehicular networks, though
    different countries use different ways to divide the band into channels.
      </t>
      <t>
    For direct inter-vehicular wireless connectivity, IEEE has amended  
    standard 802.11 (commonly known as Wi-Fi) to enable safe driving services based on DSRC 
    for the Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) 
    system. The Physical Layer (L1) and Data Link Layer (L2) issues are addressed 
    in IEEE 802.11p  <xref target="IEEE-802.11p" format="default"/> 
    for the PHY and MAC layers of the DSRC, while IEEE Std 1609.2 <xref target="WAVE-1609.2" format="default"/> 
    covers security aspects, IEEE Std 1609.3 <xref target="WAVE-1609.3" format="default"/> 
    defines related services at network and transport layers, and IEEE Std 1609.4 
    <xref target="WAVE-1609.4" format="default"/> specifies the multichannel operation. 
    IEEE 802.11p was first a separate amendment but was later rolled into
    the base 802.11 standard (IEEE Std 802.11-2012) as IEEE 802.11 Outside the Context 
    of a Basic Service Set (OCB) in 2012 <xref target="IEEE-802.11-OCB" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
    3GPP has standardized Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communications
	to support V2X in LTE mobile networks (called LTE V2X)
    and V2X in 5G mobile networks (called 5G V2X) <xref target="TS-23.285-3GPP" format="default"/>
        <xref target="TR-22.886-3GPP" format="default"/> <xref target="TS-23.287-3GPP" format="default"/>.
	With C-V2X,	vehicles can directly communicate with each other without 
	relay nodes (e.g., eNodeB in LTE and gNodeB in 5G).
      </t>
      <t>
   	Along with these WAVE standards and C-V2X standards, regardless of a
   	wireless access technology under the IP stack of a vehicle, vehicular
   	networks can operate IP mobility with IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200"
   	format="default"/>, that is, Mobile IPv6 protocols, e.g., Mobile IPv6
   	(MIPv6) <xref target="RFC6275" format="default"/>, Proxy Mobile IPv6
   	(PMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5213" format="default"/>, Distributed
   	Mobility Management (DMM) <xref target="RFC7333" format="default"/>,
   	Network Mobility (NEMO) <xref target="RFC3963" format="default"/>, and
   	the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) <xref target="RFC9300"
   	format="default"/>.  In addition, ISO has approved a standard
   	specifying the IPv6 network protocols and services to be used for
   	Communications Access for Land Mobiles (CALM) <xref
   	target="ISO-ITS-IPv6" format="default"/> <xref
   	target="ISO-ITS-IPv6-AMD1" format="default"/>.

    This document describes use cases and a problem statement about
    IPv6-based vehicular networking for ITS, which is named IPv6 Wireless Access in 
    Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE).
    First, it introduces the use cases for using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking 
    in ITS.
    Next, for IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of 
    current IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, mobility 
    management, as well as security and privacy) so that those protocols 
    can be tailored to IPv6-based vehicular networking. 
    Thus, this document is intended to motivate development of
    key protocols for IPWAVE.

<section anchor="section_Use-Cases" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Use Cases</name>
      <t>
    This section explains use cases of V2V, V2I, and V2X networking. 
    The use cases of the V2X networking exclude the ones of the V2V 
    and V2I networking but include Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) and 
    Vehicle-to-Device (V2D).
      </t>
      <t>
    IP is widely used among popular end-user devices (e.g., 
    smartphone and tablet) in the Internet. Applications 
    (e.g., navigator application) for those devices can be extended
    such that the V2V use cases in this section can work with IPv6
    as a network layer protocol and IEEE 802.11-OCB as a link-layer
    protocol.  In addition, IPv6 security needs to be extended to
    support those V2V use cases in a safe, secure, privacy-preserving
    way.
      </t>
      <t>	
    The use cases presented in this section serve as the description and
    motivation for the need to augment IPv6 and its protocols to facilitate
    "Vehicular IPv6". <xref target="section_Problem-Statement" format="default"/>
    summarizes the overall problem statement and IPv6 requirements.
    Note that the adjective "Vehicular" in this document is used to 
    represent extensions of existing protocols, such as IPv6 Neighbor 
    Discovery, IPv6 Mobility Management (e.g., PMIPv6 
    <xref target="RFC5213" format="default"/> and DMM <xref target="RFC7429" format="default"/>), and 
    IPv6 Security and Privacy Mechanisms rather than new 
    "vehicular-specific" functions.
      </t>
      <section anchor="subsection_V2V-Use-Cases" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>V2V</name>
        <t>
    The use cases of V2V networking discussed in this section include:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Context-aware navigation for driving safely and avoiding collisions</li>
          <li>Collision avoidance service of end systems of Urban Air Mobility
          (UAM)</li>
          <li>Cooperative adaptive cruise control on a roadway</li>
          <li>Platooning on a highway</li>
          <li>Cooperative environment sensing</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
    The above use cases are examples for using V2V networking, which can 
    be extended to other terrestrial vehicles, river/sea ships, 
    railed vehicles, or UAM end systems.
        </t>
        <t>
    A Context-Aware Safety Driving (CASD) navigator <xref target="CASD" format="default"/>
    can help drivers to drive safely as a context-aware navigation service
    <xref target="CNP" format="default"/> by alerting them to
    dangerous obstacles and situations. That is, a CASD navigator displays
    obstacles or neighboring vehicles relevant to possible collisions in
    real time through V2V networking. CASD provides vehicles with a
    class-based automatic safety action plan that considers three
    situations, namely, the Line-of-Sight unsafe, Non-Line-of-Sight
    unsafe, and safe situations. This action plan can be put into action
    among multiple vehicles using V2V networking.
        </t>

        <t>A service for collision avoidance of in-air UAM end systems is one
        possible use case in air vehicular environments <xref
        target="I-D.templin-ipwave-uam-its" format="default"/>. This use case
        is similar to that of a context-aware navigator for
        terrestrial vehicles.  Through V2V coordination, those UAM end systems
        (e.g., drones) can avoid a dangerous situation (e.g., collision) in
        three-dimensional space rather than two-dimensional space for
        terrestrial vehicles.  Also, a UAM end system (e.g., flying car), when
        only a few hundred meters off the ground, can communicate with terrestrial
        vehicles with wireless communication technologies (e.g., DSRC, LTE,
        and C-V2X).  Thus, V2V means any vehicle to any vehicle, whether the
        vehicles are ground level or not.
        </t>
        <t>
    Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)
    <xref target="CA-Cruise-Control" format="default"/> helps individual vehicles to adapt their
    speed autonomously through V2V communication among vehicles according
    to the mobility of their predecessor and successor vehicles on an
    urban roadway or a highway. Thus, CACC can help adjacent vehicles to
    efficiently adjust their speed in an interactive way through V2V 
    networking in order to avoid a collision.
        </t>

        <t>
    Platooning <xref target="Truck-Platooning" format="default"/> allows a series (or group) of
    vehicles (e.g., trucks) to follow each other very closely.
    Vehicles can use V2V communication in addition to
    forward sensors in order to maintain constant clearance between two
    consecutive vehicles at very short gaps (from 3 to 10 meters).
    Platooning can maximize the throughput of vehicular traffic on
    a highway and reduce the gas consumption because the lead vehicle
    can help the following vehicles experience less air resistance.  
        </t>
        <t>
    Cooperative-environment-sensing use cases suggest that vehicles can 
    share environmental information (e.g., air pollution, hazards, obstacles,
    slippery areas by snow or rain, road accidents, traffic congestion,
    and driving behaviors of neighboring vehicles) from various
    vehicle-mounted sensors, such as radars, LiDAR systems, and cameras, with other
    vehicles and pedestrians.
    <xref target="Automotive-Sensing" format="default"/> introduces millimeter-wave 
    vehicular communication for massive automotive sensing. 
    A lot of data can be generated by those sensors, and 
    these data typically need to be routed to different destinations. 
    In addition, from the perspective of driverless vehicles, it is 
    expected that driverless vehicles can be mixed with driver-operated 
    vehicles. Through cooperative environment sensing, driver-operated 
    vehicles can use environmental information sensed by driverless vehicles 
    for better interaction with the other vehicles and environment.
    Vehicles can also share their intended maneuvering information (e.g.,
    lane change, speed change, ramp in-and-out, cut-in, and abrupt braking)
    with neighboring vehicles.
	Thus, this information sharing can help the vehicles behave as more
    efficient traffic flows and minimize unnecessary acceleration and
    deceleration to achieve the best ride comfort.
        </t>
        <t>
    To support applications of these V2V use cases, the required functions of
    IPv6 include (a) IPv6-based packet exchange in both control and data planes
    and (b) secure, safe communication between two vehicles.  For the support of
    V2V under multiple radio technologies (e.g., DSRC and 5G V2X), refer to
    <xref target="appendix_Support-of-Multiple-Radio-Technologies-for-V2V"

        <name>V2I</name>
        <t>
        The use cases of V2I networking discussed in this section include:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Navigation service</li>

    A navigation service (for example, the Self-Adaptive Interactive
    Navigation Tool <xref target="SAINT" format="default"/>) that uses
    V2I networking interacts with a TCC for the large-scale/long-range road
    traffic optimization and can guide individual vehicles along appropriate
    navigation paths in real time.  The enhanced version of SAINT <xref
    target="SAINTplus" format="default"/> can give fast-moving paths to
    emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulance and fire engine) to let them reach an
    accident spot while redirecting other vehicles near the accident spot into
    efficient detour paths.
        </t>
        <t>
    Either a TCC or an ECD can recommend an energy-efficient speed to a vehicle 
    that depends on its traffic environment and traffic signal scheduling
    <xref target="SignalGuru" format="default"/>. For example, when a vehicle approaches 
    an intersection area and a red traffic light for the vehicle becomes
    turned on, it needs to reduce its speed to save fuel consumption. In 
    this case, either a TCC or an ECD, which has the up-to-date
    trajectory of the vehicle and the traffic light schedule, can notify
    the vehicle of an appropriate speed for fuel efficiency.
    <xref target="Fuel-Efficient" format="default"/> covers fuel-efficient route 
    and speed plans for platooned trucks. 
        </t>

        <t> 
    The emergency communication between vehicles in an accident (or emergency-response
    vehicles) and a TCC can be performed via either IP-RSUs or 4G-LTE or 
    5G networks.
    The First Responder Network Authority 
    <xref target="FirstNet" format="default"/> is provided by the US government to
    establish, operate, and maintain an interoperable public safety
    broadband network for safety and security network services, e.g.,
    emergency calls. The construction of the nationwide FirstNet network
    requires each state in the US to have a Radio Access Network (RAN)
    that will connect to the FirstNet's network core. 
    The current RAN is mainly constructed using 4G-LTE for communication 
    between a vehicle and an infrastructure node (i.e., V2I) 
    <xref target="FirstNet-Report" format="default"/>, but it is expected that DSRC-based vehicular 
    networks <xref target="DSRC" format="default"/> will be available for V2I and V2V in the near future.
    An equivalent project in Europe is called Public Safety Communications 
    Europe <xref target="PSCE" format="default"/>, which is developing a network for 
    emergency communications.

    An EV charging service with V2I can facilitate the efficient battery
    charging of EVs. In the case where an EV charging station is connected to
    an IP-RSU, an EV can be guided toward the deck of the EV charging station
    or be notified that the charging station is out of service 
    through a battery charging server connected to the IP-RSU. In addition to
    this EV charging service, other value-added services (e.g., 
    firmware/software update over-the-air and media streaming) 
    can be provided to an EV
    while it is charging its battery at the EV charging station. 
    For a UAM navigation service, an efficient battery charging plan can 
    improve the battery charging schedule of UAM end systems (e.g., drones) 
    for long-distance flying <xref target="CBDN" format="default"/>.
    For this battery charging schedule, a UAM end system can communicate with
    a cloud server via an infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU). 
    This cloud server can coordinate the battery charging 
    schedules of multiple UAM end systems for their efficient navigation path,
    considering flight time from their current position to a battery charging
    station, waiting time in a waiting queue at the station, and battery
    charging time at the station.

    In some scenarios, such as vehicles moving on highways or staying in parking
    lots, a V2V2I network is necessary for vehicles to access the Internet
    since some vehicles may not be covered by an IP-RSU. For those vehicles, 
    a few relay vehicles can help to build the Internet access. For the 
    nested NEMO described in 
    <xref target="RFC4888" format="default"/>, hosts inside a vehicle shown in 
    <xref target="fig_v2v-internetworking" format="default"/> 
    for the case of V2V2I may have the same issue in the nested NEMO scenario.

    To better support these use cases, the existing IPv6 protocol must be 
    augmented either through protocol changes or by including a new adaptation
    layer in the architecture that efficiently maps IPv6 to a diversity of 
    link-layer technologies.
    Augmentation is necessary to support wireless multihop V2I communications
    on a highway where RSUs are sparsely deployed so that a vehicle can reach the
    wireless coverage of an IP-RSU through the multihop data forwarding of 
    intermediate vehicles as packet forwarders.  Thus, IPv6 needs to be extended for multihop V2I
    communications. 
        </t>
        <t>
    To support applications of these V2I use cases, the required functions
    of IPv6 include IPv6 communication enablement with neighborhood discovery
    and IPv6 address management; reachability with adapted network models and
    routing methods; transport-layer session continuity; and secure, safe
    communication between a vehicle and an infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU) 
    in the vehicular network.

        <name>V2X</name>
        <t>
    The use case of V2X networking discussed in this section is
    for a protection service for a vulnerable road user (VRU), e.g., 
    a pedestrian or cyclist.
    Note that the application area of this use case is currently limited 
    to a specific environment, such as construction sites, plants, and 
    factories, since not every VRU in a public area 
    is equipped with a smart device (e.g., not every child on a road
    has a smartphone, smart watch, or tablet). 
        </t>
        <t>
    A VRU protection service, such as the Safety-Aware Navigation Application
    <xref target="SANA" format="default"/>, using V2I2P networking can
    reduce the collision of a vehicle and a pedestrian carrying a smartphone
    equipped with a network device for wireless communication (e.g., Wi-Fi,
    DSRC, 4G/5G V2X, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)) with an IP-RSU.  
    Vehicles and pedestrians can also communicate with each other via an IP-RSU.
    An ECD behind the IP-RSU can collect the mobility information from vehicles and
    pedestrians, and then compute wireless communication scheduling for the sake of
    them. This scheduling can save the battery of each pedestrian's smartphone
    by allowing it to work in sleeping mode before communication with
    vehicles, considering their mobility.  The location information of a VRU
    from a smart device (e.g., smartphone) is multicasted only to the nearby
    vehicles.  The true identifiers of a VRU's smart device shall be
    protected, and only the type of the VRU, such as pedestrian, cyclist, or
    scooter, is disclosed to the nearby vehicles.</t>
        <t>
    For Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), a vehicle can directly communicate 
    with a pedestrian's smartphone by V2X without IP-RSU relaying. 
    Light-weight mobile nodes, such as bicycles, may also communicate 
    directly with a vehicle for collision avoidance using V2V. Note that 
    it is true that either a pedestrian or a cyclist may have a higher risk of 
    being hit by a vehicle if they are not with a smartphone in the current 
    setting. For this 
    case, other human-sensing technologies (e.g., moving-object detection 
    in images and wireless signal-based human movement detection 
    <xref target="LIFS" format="default"/> <xref target="DFC" format="default"/>) can be 
    used to provide motion information to vehicles. A vehicle 
    by V2V2I networking can obtain a VRU's motion information 
    via an IP-RSU that either employs or connects to a human-sensing technology.
        </t>
        <t>
    The existing IPv6 protocol must be augmented through protocol changes
    in order to support wireless multihop V2X or V2I2X communications in an
    urban road network where RSUs are deployed at intersections so that a vehicle
    (or a pedestrian's smartphone) can reach the wireless coverage of an IP-RSU
    through the multihop data forwarding of intermediate vehicles (or
    pedestrians' smartphones) as packet forwarders.  Thus, IPv6 needs to be
    extended for multihop V2X or V2I2X communications.
        </t>
        <t>
    To support applications of these V2X use cases, the required functions
    of IPv6 include IPv6-based packet exchange; transport-layer session
    continuity; secure, safe communication between a vehicle and a
    pedestrian either directly or indirectly via an IP-RSU; and the
    protection of identifiers of either a vehicle or smart device (such as the
    Media Access Control (MAC) address and IPv6 address), which is discussed in detail in
    <xref target="section_Other-Threats" format="default"/>.

    <xref target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/> shows an
    example vehicular network architecture for V2I and V2V in 
    a road network. 
    The vehicular network architecture contains vehicles 
    (including IP-OBU), IP-RSUs, Mobility Anchor, Traffic Control
    Center, and Vehicular Cloud as components. 
    These components are not mandatory, and they can be deployed
    into vehicular networks in various ways. Some of them (e.g., 
    Mobility Anchor, Traffic Control Center, and Vehicular Cloud) may
    not be needed for the vehicular networks according to target use
    cases in <xref target="section_Use-Cases" format="default"/>.

    Existing network architectures, such as the network architectures of
    PMIPv6 <xref target="RFC5213" format="default"/>, RPL (IPv6 Routing
    Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) <xref target="RFC6550"
    format="default"/>, Automatic Extended Route Optimization <xref

    Multilink Network Interface <xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-omni"
    format="default"/>, can be extended to a vehicular network architecture
    for multihop V2V, V2I, and V2X, as shown in <xref

    <xref target="appendix_Support-of-Multihop-V2X" format="default"/> for the

    is not actually deployed in the industry, this AERO/OMNI is mentioned as a
    possible approach for vehicular networks in this document.
        </t>
        <t>
    As shown in <xref target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/>, IP-RSUs as 
    routers and vehicles with IP-OBU 
    have wireless media interfaces for VANET. 
    The three IP-RSUs (IP-RSU1, IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3) are deployed in the road 
    network and are connected with each other through the wired networks 
    (e.g., Ethernet). 
    A Traffic Control Center (TCC) is connected to the Vehicular Cloud for
    the management of IP-RSUs and vehicles in the road network. 
    A Mobility Anchor (MA) may be located in the TCC as a mobility management
    controller. 
    Vehicle2, Vehicle3, and Vehicle4 are wirelessly connected to IP-RSU1, 
    IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3, respectively.
    The three wireless networks of IP-RSU1, IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3 can belong to three 
    different subnets (i.e., Subnet1, Subnet2, and Subnet3), respectively.
    Those three subnets use three different prefixes (i.e., Prefix1, Prefix2, 
    and Prefix3).
        </t>
        <t>
    Multiple vehicles under the coverage of an IP-RSU share a prefix just as
    mobile nodes share a prefix of a Wi-Fi access point in a wireless
    LAN. This is a natural characteristic in infrastructure-based wireless
    networks. 

For example, in <xref target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/>, 
    two vehicles (i.e., Vehicle2 and Vehicle5) can use Prefix1 to configure
    their IPv6 global addresses for V2I communication.
    Alternatively, two vehicles can employ a "Bring Your Own Addresses (BYOA)" 
    (or "Bring Your Own Prefix (BYOP)") technique using their own IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) 
    <xref target="RFC4193" format="default"/> over the wireless network.
        </t>
        <t>
    In wireless subnets in vehicular networks (e.g., Subnet1 and Subnet2
    in <xref target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/>), vehicles can 
    construct a connected VANET (with an arbitrary graph topology) and can 
    communicate with each other via V2V communication.
    Vehicle1 can communicate with Vehicle2 via V2V communication, and 
    Vehicle2 can communicate with Vehicle3 via V2V communication because
    they are within the wireless communication range of each other.
    On the other hand, Vehicle3 can communicate with 
    Vehicle4 via the vehicular infrastructure (i.e., IP-RSU2 and IP-RSU3) 
    by employing V2I (i.e., V2I2V) communication because they are not 
    within the wireless communication range of each other.
        </t>
        <t>
    As a basic definition for IPv6 packets transported over IEEE 802.11-OCB, 
    <xref target="RFC8691" format="default"/> specifies several details, including
    Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), frame format, link-local address, 
    address mapping for unicast and multicast, stateless autoconfiguration, and 
    subnet structure.
        </t>
        <t>
    An IPv6 mobility solution is needed for the guarantee of communication
    continuity in vehicular networks so that a vehicle's TCP session can be
    continued or that UDP packets can be delivered to a vehicle as a
    destination without loss while it moves from an IP-RSU's wireless coverage
    to another IP-RSU's wireless coverage.  In <xref
    target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/>, assuming
    that Vehicle2 has a TCP session (or a UDP session) with a correspondent
    node in the Vehicular Cloud, Vehicle2 can move from IP-RSU1's wireless
    coverage to IP-RSU2's wireless coverage. In this case, a handover for
    Vehicle2 needs to be performed by either a host-based mobility management
    scheme (e.g., MIPv6 <xref target="RFC6275" format="default"/>) or a
    network-based mobility management scheme (e.g., PMIPv6 <xref
    target="RFC5213" format="default"/>, NEMO <xref target="RFC3963"
    format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4885" format="default"/> <xref
    target="RFC4888" format="default"/>, and AERO <xref
    target="I-D.templin-intarea-aero" format="default"/>).  This document
    describes issues in mobility management for vehicular networks in <xref
    target="subsection_Mobility-Management" format="default"/>.  For improving
    TCP session continuity or successful UDP packet delivery, the Multipath
    TCP (MPTCP) <xref target="RFC8684" format="default"/> or QUIC protocol
    <xref target="RFC9000" format="default"/> can also be used. IP-OBUs,
    however, may still experience more session time-out and re-establishment
    procedures due to lossy connections among vehicles caused by the high
    mobility dynamics of them.

        <name>V2I-Based Internetworking</name>
        <t>
    This section discusses the internetworking between a vehicle's
    internal network (i.e., mobile network) and an EN's internal 
    network (i.e., fixed network) via V2I communication.  
    The internal network of a vehicle is nowadays constructed with
    Ethernet by many automotive vendors <xref target="In-Car-Network" format="default"/>.
    Note that an EN can accommodate multiple routers (or switches) 
    and servers (e.g., ECDs, navigation server, and DNS server) 
    in its internal network.
        </t>
        <t>
    A vehicle's internal network often uses Ethernet to interconnect
    Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the vehicle.  The internal network can
    support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to accommodate a driver's and passenger's
    mobile devices (e.g., smartphone or tablet).  The network topology and
    subnetting depend on each vendor's network configuration for a vehicle and
    an EN.  It is reasonable to consider interactions between the internal
    network of a vehicle and that of another vehicle or an EN.  Note that it
    is dangerous if the internal network of a vehicle is controlled by a
    malicious party. These dangers can include unauthorized driving control
    input and unauthorized driving information disclosure to an unauthorized
    third party. A malicious party can be a group of hackers, a criminal
    group, and a competitor for industrial espionage or sabotage.  To minimize
    this kind of risk, an augmented identification and verification protocol,
    which has an extra means, shall be implemented based on a basic identity
    verification process. 

   These extra means could include approaches based on certificates,
   biometrics, credit, or One-Time Passwords (OTPs) 
   in addition to Host Identity Protocol certificates <xref target="RFC8002" format="default"/>.
    The parties of the verification protocol can be from a built-in
    verification protocol in the current vehicle, which is pre-installed by a
    vehicle vendor.  The parties can also be from any verification authorities
    that have the database of authenticated users.  The security properties
    provided by a verification protocol can be identity-related information,
    such as the genuineness of an identity, the authenticity of an identity,
    and the ownership of an identity <xref target="RFC7427"
    format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
    The augmented identification and verification protocol with extra means can
    support security properties such as the identification and verification of
    a vehicle, driver, and passenger.  

   First, a credit-based method is when a vehicle classifies the messages it received
   from another host into various levels based on their potential
   effects on driving safety in order to calculate the credit of that sender. 
   Based on accumulated credit, a correspondent node can verify
    the other party to see whether it is genuine or not.  Second, a
     certificate-based method includes a user certificate (e.g., X.509
     certificate <xref target="RFC5280" format="default"/>) to authenticate a vehicle or its
     driver.  Third, a biometric method includes a fingerprint, face, or voice to
     authenticate a driver or passenger.  Lastly, an OTP-based method lets another already-authenticated device (e.g., smartphone and
     tablet) of a driver or passenger be used to authenticate a driver or
     passenger.

        <t>
    As shown in <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default"/>, as internal
    networks, a vehicle's mobile network and an EN's fixed network 
    are self-contained networks having multiple subnets and having 
    an edge router (e.g., IP-OBU and IP-RSU) for communication with 
    another vehicle or another EN.  
    The internetworking between two internal networks via V2I communication 
    requires the exchange of the network parameters and the network 
    prefixes of the internal networks. For the efficiency, the network
    prefixes of the internal networks (as a mobile network) in a 
    vehicle need to be delegated and configured automatically. Note
    that a mobile network's network prefix can be called a Mobile
    Network Prefix (MNP) <xref target="RFC3963" format="default"/>. 	
        </t>
        <t>
    <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default"/> also shows the internetworking
    between the vehicle's mobile network and the EN's fixed network. 
    There exists an internal network (Mobile Network1) inside Vehicle1. 
    Vehicle1 has two hosts (Host1 and Host2) and two routers (IP-OBU1 
    and Router1).  There exists another internal network (Fixed Network1) 
    inside EN1.  EN1 has one host (Host3), two routers (IP-RSU1 and 
    Router2), and the collection of servers (Server1 to ServerN) for 
    various services in the road networks, such as the emergency 
    notification and navigation.  Vehicle1's IP-OBU1 (as a mobile router) 
    and EN1's IP-RSU1 (as a fixed router) use 2001:db8:1:1::/64 for an 
    external link (e.g., DSRC) for V2I networking.
    Thus, a host (Host1) in Vehicle1 can communicate with a server 
    (Server1) in EN1 for a vehicular service through Vehicle1's mobile
    network, a wireless link between IP-OBU1 and IP-RSU1, and EN1's fixed 
    network.
        </t>
        <t>
   	For the IPv6 communication between an IP-OBU and an IP-RSU or between 
    two neighboring IP-OBUs, they need to know the network parameters, 
    which include MAC layer and IPv6 layer information.  
    The MAC layer information includes wireless link-layer parameters, 
    transmission power level, and the MAC address of an external network 
    interface for the internetworking with another IP-OBU or IP-RSU.  
    The IPv6 layer information includes the IPv6 address and network 
    prefix of an external network interface for the internetworking with 
    another IP-OBU or IP-RSU.
        </t>
        <t>
    Through the mutual knowledge of the network parameters of 
    internal networks, packets can be transmitted between the vehicle's mobile 
    network and the EN's fixed network. Thus, V2I requires an efficient 
    protocol for the mutual knowledge of network parameters. Note that 
    from a security point of view, perimeter-based policy enforcement
    <xref target="RFC9099" format="default"/> 
    can be applied to protect parts of the internal network of a vehicle.
        </t>
        <t>
    As shown in <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default"/>, the addresses
    used for IPv6 transmissions over the wireless link interfaces for
    IP-OBU and IP-RSU can be IPv6 link-local addresses, ULAs, or IPv6 global 
    addresses. When IPv6 addresses are used, wireless interface
    configuration and control overhead for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/> and
    Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) <xref target="RFC2710" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC3810" format="default"/>
    should be minimized to support V2I and V2X communications for vehicles
    moving fast along roadways.
        </t>
        <t>
    Let us consider the upload/download time of a ground vehicle when it passes
    through the wireless communication coverage of an IP-RSU.
    For a given typical setting where 1 km is the maximum DSRC communication
    range <xref target="DSRC" format="default"/> and 100 km/h is the speed limit on highways for
    ground vehicles, the dwelling time can be calculated to be 72 seconds 
    by dividing the diameter
    of the 2 km (i.e., two times the DSRC communication range where an IP-RSU
    is located in the center of the circle of wireless communication) by
    the speed limit of 100 km/h (i.e., about 28 m/s). For the 72 seconds, a
    vehicle passing through the coverage of an IP-RSU can upload and download
    data packets to/from the IP-RSU. 
    For special cases, such as emergency vehicles moving above the speed limit,
    the dwelling time is relatively shorter than that of other vehicles.
    For cases of airborne vehicles (i.e., aircraft), considering a higher
    flying speed and a higher altitude, the dwelling time can be much shorter.

    As shown in <xref target="fig_multihop-v2i2v-internetworking" format="default"/>,
    multihop internetworking between two vehicles is feasible via
    an infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU) with wireless connectivity
    among the mobile networks of two vehicles and the fixed network of
    an edge network (denoted as EN1) in the same VANET. For example, 
    Host1 in Vehicle1 can communicate with Host3 in Vehicle3 via 
    IP-OBU1 in Vehicle1, IP-RSU1 in EN1, and IP-OBU3 in Vehicle3 in
    the VANET, as shown in the figure.

	For the reliability required in V2V networking, the ND optimization
	defined in the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) <xref target="RFC6130" format="default"/>
          <xref target="RFC7466" format="default"/> improves the classical IPv6 ND in terms
	of tracking neighbor information with up to two hops and introducing
	several extensible Information Bases. This improvement serves the MANET routing
	protocols, such as the different versions of Optimized Link State
	Routing Protocol (OLSR) <xref target="RFC3626" format="default"/>
          <xref target="RFC7181" format="default"/>, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) derivatives 
    (e.g., <xref target="RFC5614" format="default"/>), and Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) 
    <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/> with its extensions <xref target="RFC8629" format="default"/>
          <xref target="RFC8757" format="default"/>.
    In short, the MANET ND mainly deals with
	maintaining extended network neighbors to enhance the link reliability. 
    However, an ND protocol in
	vehicular networks shall consider more about the geographical mobility
	information of vehicles as an important resource for serving various
	purposes to improve the reliability, e.g., vehicle driving safety, 
	intelligent transportation implementations, and advanced mobility
    services. For a more reliable V2V networking, some redundancy
    mechanisms should be provided in L3 in cases of the failure of L2. 
    For different use cases, the optimal solution to improve V2V networking
    reliability may vary. For example, a group of platooning vehicles may 
    have stabler neighbors than freely moving vehicles, as described in 
    <xref target="subsection_V2V-Use-Cases" format="default"/>.

      <t>
    In order to specify protocols using the architecture mentioned in 
    <xref target="subsection_GP-Vehicular-Network-Architecture" format="default"/>, 
    IPv6 core protocols have to be adapted to overcome certain
    challenging aspects of vehicular networking.  Since the vehicles are
    likely to be moving at great speed, protocol exchanges need to be
    completed in a relatively short time compared to the lifetime of a
    link between a vehicle and an IP-RSU or between two vehicles.  
    In these cases, vehicles may not have enough time either to build 
    link-layer connections with each other and may rely more on 
    connections with infrastructure.  
    In other cases, the relative speed between vehicles 
    may be low when vehicles move toward the same direction or 
    are platooned. 
    For those cases, vehicles can have more time to build and maintain 
    connections with each other.
      </t>
      <t>
    For safe driving, vehicles need to exchange application messages
    every 0.5 seconds <xref target="NHTSA-ACAS-Report" format="default"/> to let drivers
    take an action to avoid a dangerous situation (e.g., vehicle collision),
    so the IPv6 control plane (e.g., ND procedure and DAD) needs 
    to support this order of magnitude for application message exchanges.
    Also, considering the communication range of DSRC (up to 1 km) and
    100 km/h as the speed limit on highways (some countries can have much 
    higher speed limits or even no limit, e.g., Germany), 
    the lifetime of a link between
    a vehicle and an IP-RSU is in the order of a minute (e.g., about 
    72 seconds), and the lifetime of a link
    between two vehicles is about a half minute. 
    Note that if two vehicles are moving in the opposite directions in
    a roadway, the relative speed of this case is two times the relative
    speed of a vehicle passing through an IP-RSU. 

    This relative speed causes the lifetime of the wireless link between the vehicle and the IP-RSU to be halved.
    In reality, the DSRC communication range is around 500 m, so the link
    lifetime will be half of the maximum time.
    The time constraint of a wireless link between two nodes (e.g., vehicle
    and IP-RSU) needs to be considered because it may affect the lifetime
    of a session involving the link.
    The lifetime of a session varies depending on the session's type,
    such as web surfing, a voice call over IP, a DNS query, or
    context-aware navigation (in <xref target="subsection_V2V-Use-Cases" format="default"/>). 
    Regardless of a session's type, to guide all the IPv6 packets to
    their destination host(s), IP mobility should be supported for the
    session. In a V2V scenario (e.g., context-aware navigation
    <xref target="CNP" format="default"/>), the IPv6
    packets of a vehicle should be delivered to relevant vehicles efficiently 
    (e.g., multicasting).
    With this observation, IPv6 protocol exchanges need to be performed as 
    quickly as possible to support the message exchanges of various 
    applications in vehicular networks.
      </t>
      <t>
    Therefore, the time constraint of a wireless link has a major impact on
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND). Mobility Management (MM) is also 
    vulnerable to disconnections that occur before the completion of 
    identity verification and tunnel management.  This is especially
    true given the unreliable nature of wireless communication.
    Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the wireless link determined by the
    lower layers (i.e., PHY and link layers) can affect the transmission
    time of control messages of the upper layers (e.g., IPv6) and the
    continuity of sessions in the higher layers (e.g., IPv6, TCP, and UDP).
    Hence, the bandwidth selection according to the Modulation and Coding Scheme
    (MCS) also affects the vehicular network connectivity. Note that usually
    the higher bandwidth gives the shorter communication range and the
    higher packet error rate at the receiving side, which may reduce the
    reliability of control message exchanges of the higher layers (e.g.,
    IPv6). This section presents key topics, such as neighbor discovery and
    mobility management for links and sessions in IPv6-based vehicular
    networks. 
    Note that the detailed discussion on the transport-layer session 
    mobility and usage of available bandwidth to fulfill the use cases 
    is left as potential future work.

    IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>
    is a core part of the IPv6 protocol suite. IPv6 ND is designed 
    for link types including point-to-point, multicast-capable (e.g.,
    Ethernet), and Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA).
    It assumes the efficient and reliable support of multicast and
    unicast from the link layer for various network operations,
    such as MAC Address Resolution (AR), DAD, MLD, and Neighbor
    Unreachability Detection (NUD)
    <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>
    <xref target="RFC2710" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC3810" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>	  
    Vehicles move quickly within the communication coverage of any 
    particular vehicle or IP-RSU.  Before the vehicles can exchange 
    application messages with each other, they need IPv6 addresses
    to run IPv6 ND.
        </t>
        <t>
    The requirements for IPv6 ND for vehicular networks are efficient
    DAD and NUD operations. An efficient DAD is required to reduce 
    the overhead of DAD packets during a vehicle's travel in a
    road network, which can guarantee the uniqueness of a vehicle's
    global IPv6 address. An efficient NUD is required to reduce the
    overhead of the NUD packets during a vehicle's travel in a road
    network, which can guarantee the accurate neighborhood information
    of a vehicle in terms of adjacent vehicles and IP-RSUs.
        </t>
        <t>
    The legacy DAD assumes that a node with an IPv6 address can reach any
    other node with the scope of its address at the time it claims its address,
    and can hear any future claim for that address by another party within 
    the scope of its address for the duration of the address ownership.
    However, the partitioning and merging of VANETs makes this assumption 
    not valid frequently in vehicular networks.
    The partitioning and merging of VANETs frequently occurs in vehicular 
    networks. 
    This partitioning and merging should be considered for 
    IPv6 ND, such as IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>. 
    SLAAC is not compatible with the partitioning and merging, and additional
    work is needed for ND to operate properly under those circumstances.
    Due to the merging of VANETs, two IPv6 addresses may conflict with
    each other though they were unique before the merging. An address
    lookup operation may be conducted by an MA or IP-RSU (as Registrar in
    RPL) to check the uniqueness of an IPv6 address that will be
    configured by a vehicle as DAD.
    Also, the partitioning of a VANET may make vehicles with the same 
    prefix be physically unreachable. An address lookup operation may be
    conducted by an MA or IP-RSU (as Registrar in RPL) to check the
    existence of a vehicle under the network coverage of the MA or IP-RSU
    as NUD.
    Thus, SLAAC needs to prevent IPv6 address duplication due to the
    merging of VANETs, and IPv6 ND needs to detect unreachable neighboring
    vehicles due to the partitioning of a VANET.
    According to the partitioning and merging, a destination vehicle
    (as an IPv6 host) needs to be distinguished as a host that is either
    on-link or not on-link even though the source vehicle can use the
    same prefix as the destination vehicle <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-ippl" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
    To efficiently prevent IPv6 address duplication (due to the VANET 
    partitioning and merging) from happening in vehicular networks, the 
    vehicular networks need to support a vehicular-network-wide DAD by 
    defining a scope that is compatible with the legacy DAD. In this case, 
    two vehicles can communicate with each other when there exists a
    communication path over VANET or a combination of VANETs and IP-RSUs, 
    as shown in <xref target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/>.
    By using the vehicular-network-wide DAD, vehicles can assure that 
    their IPv6 addresses are unique in the vehicular network whenever 
    they are connected to the vehicular infrastructure or become 
    disconnected from it in the form of VANET.		
        </t>
        <t>
    For vehicular networks with high mobility and density, DAD 
    needs to be performed efficiently with minimum overhead so that
    the vehicles can exchange driving safety messages (e.g., 
    collision avoidance and accident notification) with each other
    with a short interval as suggested by
    the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U.S.
    <xref target="NHTSA-ACAS-Report" format="default"/>.  
    Since the partitioning and merging of vehicular networks may
    require re-performing the DAD process repeatedly, the link scope
    of vehicles may be limited to a small area, which may delay
    the exchange of driving safety messages. Driving safety
    messages can include a vehicle's mobility information (e.g., 
    position, speed, direction, and acceleration/deceleration)
    that is critical to other vehicles.  The exchange interval of
    this message is recommended to be less than 0.5 seconds, which is required
    for a driver to avoid an emergency situation, such as a rear-end crash.
        </t>
        <t>
    ND time-related parameters, such as router lifetime and Neighbor
    Advertisement (NA) interval, need to be adjusted for vehicle speed
    and vehicle density. 

    For example, the NA interval needs to be dynamically adjusted
    according to a vehicle's speed so that the vehicle can maintain
    its position relative to its neighboring vehicles in a stable way,
    considering the collision probability with the NA messages sent
    by other vehicles. The ND time-related parameters can be an operational
    setting or an optimization point particularly for vehicular networks.
    Note that the link-scope multicast messages in the ND protocol may cause 
    a performance issue in vehicular networks. <xref target="RFC9119" format="default"/>
    suggests several optimization approaches for the issue.
        </t>
        <t>	  
    For IPv6-based safety applications (e.g., context-aware navigation, 
    adaptive cruise control, and platooning) in vehicular networks, 
    the delay-bounded data delivery is critical. IPv6 ND needs to 
    work to support those IPv6-based safety applications efficiently.
    <xref target="I-D.jeong-ipwave-vehicular-neighbor-discovery" format="default"/> introduces 
    a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) process as an extension of IPv6 ND 
    for IP-based vehicular networks.
        </t>
        <t>
    From the interoperability point of view, in IPv6-based vehicular 
    networking, IPv6 ND should have minimum changes from the legacy
    IPv6 ND used in the Internet, including DAD and NUD operations,
    so that IPv6-based vehicular networks can be seamlessly connected
    to other intelligent transportation elements (e.g., traffic signals,
    pedestrian wearable devices, electric scooters, and bus stops) that
    use the standard IPv6 network settings.

    A subnet model for a vehicular network needs to facilitate 
    communication between two vehicles with the same prefix regardless
    of the vehicular network topology as long as there exist  
    bidirectional E2E paths between them in the vehicular 
    network including VANETs and IP-RSUs.
    This subnet model allows vehicles with the same prefix to 
    communicate with each other via a combination of multihop V2V and
    multihop V2I with VANETs and IP-RSUs. 
    <xref target="I-D.thubert-6man-ipv6-over-wireless" format="default"/> introduces other issues in an IPv6 
    subnet model. 
          </t>
          <t>
    IPv6 protocols work under certain assumptions that do not necessarily
    hold for vehicular wireless access link types
    <xref target="VIP-WAVE" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC5889" format="default"/>.
    For instance, some IPv6 protocols, such as NUD <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/> and MIPv6 <xref target="RFC6275" format="default"/>,
    assume symmetry in the connectivity among neighboring interfaces. 
    However, radio interference and different levels of transmission power 
    may cause asymmetric links to appear in vehicular wireless links 
    <xref target="RFC6250" format="default"/>.
    As a result, a new vehicular link model needs to consider the asymmetry
    of dynamically changing vehicular wireless links.
          </t>
          <t>
    There is a relationship between a link and a prefix, besides the 
    different scopes that are expected from the link-local, unique-local,  
    and global types 
    of IPv6 addresses. In an IPv6 link, it is defined that all interfaces 
    that are configured with the same subnet prefix and with the on-link bit 
    set can communicate with each other on an IPv6 link.  However, the 
    vehicular link model needs to define the relationship between a link 
    and a prefix, considering the dynamics of wireless links and the 
    characteristics of VANET.		
          </t>
          <t>
    A VANET can have a single link between each vehicle pair within 
    the wireless communication range, as shown in 
    <xref target="fig_multihop-v2v-internetworking" format="default"/>.  When two vehicles 
    belong to the same VANET, but they are out of wireless communication 
    range, they cannot communicate directly with each other.  Suppose that 
    a global-scope IPv6 prefix (or an IPv6 ULA prefix) is assigned to
   	VANETs in vehicular networks. 
    Considering that two vehicles in the same VANET configure their IPv6 
    addresses with the same IPv6 prefix, if they are not connected in one hop (that is, they have 
    multihop network connectivity between them), then they may 
    not be able to communicate with each other.  
    Thus, in this case, the concept of 
    an on-link IPv6 prefix does not hold because two vehicles with the 
    same on-link IPv6 prefix cannot communicate directly with each other.
    Also, when two vehicles are located in two different VANETs with the 
    same IPv6 prefix, they cannot communicate with each other.
    On the other hand, when these two VANETs converge to one VANET,
    the two vehicles can communicate with each other in a multihop fashion,
    for example, when they are Vehicle1 and Vehicle3, as shown in
    <xref target="fig_multihop-v2v-internetworking" format="default"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
    From the previous observation, a vehicular link model should consider 
    the frequent partitioning and merging of VANETs due to vehicle mobility. 
    Therefore, the vehicular link model needs to use a prefix that is on-link and 
    a prefix that is not on-link according to the network topology of vehicles, such as 
    a one-hop reachable network and a multihop reachable network (or 
    partitioned networks).  If the vehicles with the same prefix are 
    reachable from each other in one hop, the prefix should be on-link.  
    On the other hand, if some of the vehicles with the same prefix are not
    reachable from each other in one hop due to either the multihop 
    topology in the VANET or multiple partitions, the prefix should not be 
    on-link. In most cases in vehicular networks, due to the partitioning
    and merging of VANETs and the multihop network topology of VANETs, 
    prefixes that are not on-link will be used for vehicles as default.
          </t>
          <t>
    The vehicular link model needs to support multihop routing in a 
    connected VANET where the vehicles with the same global-scope IPv6 
    prefix (or the same IPv6 ULA prefix) are connected in one hop or
    multiple hops.  It also needs to support the multihop routing in
    multiple connected VANETs through infrastructure nodes (e.g., IP-RSU)
    where they are connected to the infrastructure.  For example, in 
    <xref target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/>, suppose that 
    Vehicle1, Vehicle2, and Vehicle3 are configured with their IPv6 
    addresses based on the same global-scope IPv6 prefix.  Vehicle1 and 
    Vehicle3 can also communicate with each other via either multihop 
    V2V or multihop V2I2V. When Vehicle1 and Vehicle3 are connected in
    a VANET, it will be more efficient for them to communicate with each 
    other directly via VANET rather than indirectly via IP-RSUs. On the
    other hand, when Vehicle1 and Vehicle3 are farther apart than the direct
    communication range in two separate VANETs and under two different 
    IP-RSUs, they can communicate with each other through the relay of 
    IP-RSUs via V2I2V.
    Thus, the two separate VANETs can merge into one network via IP-RSU(s).  
    Also, newly arriving vehicles can merge the two separate VANETs into 
    one VANET if they can play the role of a relay node for those VANETs.
          </t>
          <t>
    Thus, in IPv6-based vehicular networking, the vehicular link model
    should have minimum changes for interoperability with standard IPv6
    links efficiently to support IPv6 DAD, MLD, and NUD
    operations.

    For the protection of drivers' privacy, a pseudonym of a MAC

    For multihop V2V communications in either a VANET or VANETs via

    routing protocol may be required to support both unicast and

    A routing protocol for a VANET may cause redundant wireless

    A defined OF provides route selection and optimization within an RPL

    The RPL nodes use an anisotropic Distance Vector (DV) approach to
    form a DODAG by discovering and aggressively maintaining the upward
    default route toward the root of the DODAG. Downward routes follow
    the same DODAG, with lazy maintenance and stretched peer-to-peer
    (P2P) routing in the so-called storing mode.
    It is well-designed to reduce the topological knowledge and routing
    state that needs to be exchanged.
    As a result, the routing protocol overhead is minimized, which allows

    An address registration extension for 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power

    through different parents.  
    The extension described in <xref target="RFC8505" /> is stateful
    and proactively installs the ND cache entries; this saves broadcasts 
    and provides deterministic presence information for IPv6 addresses. 
    Mainly, it updates the Address Registration Option (ARO) of ND 
    defined in <xref target="RFC6775" /> to include a status field (which can indicate 
    the movement of a node) and optionally a Transaction ID (TID) field 
    (which is a sequence number that can be used to determine the most

    Thus, RPL can use the information provided by
    the Extended ARO (EARO) defined in <xref target="RFC8505"

    RPL can be used in IPv6-based vehicular networks, but it is primarily

    IoT Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN) scenarios. 
    Another concern is that RPL may generate excessive topology discovery

        <name>Mobility Management</name>
        <t>
    The seamless connectivity and timely data exchange between 
    two endpoints requires efficient mobility management 
    including location management and handover.
    Most vehicles are equipped with a GNSS receiver as part of 
    a dedicated navigation system or a corresponding smartphone 
    app.  Note that the GNSS receiver may not provide vehicles with 
    accurate location information in adverse environments, such as 
    a building area or a tunnel.  The location precision can be 
    improved with assistance of the IP-RSUs or a cellular system 
    with a GNSS receiver for location information.        
        </t>
        <t>
    With a GNSS navigator, efficient mobility management can
    be performed with the help of vehicles periodically reporting 
    their current position and trajectory (i.e., navigation path) to 
    the vehicular infrastructure (having IP-RSUs and an MA in TCC). 
    This vehicular infrastructure can predict the future positions
    of the vehicles from their mobility information (e.g., the current
    position, speed, direction, and trajectory) for efficient mobility
    management (e.g., proactive handover).  For a better proactive 
    handover, link-layer parameters, such as the signal strength of a 
    link-layer frame (e.g., Received Channel Power Indicator (RCPI) 
    <xref target="VIP-WAVE" format="default"/>), can be used to determine the 
    moment of a handover between IP-RSUs along with mobility 
    information.
        </t>
        <t>
    By predicting a vehicle's mobility, the vehicular infrastructure 
    needs to better support IP-RSUs to perform efficient SLAAC, data 
    forwarding, horizontal handover (i.e., handover in wireless links
    using a homogeneous radio technology), and vertical handover 
    (i.e., handover in wireless links using heterogeneous radio 
    technologies) in advance along with the movement of the vehicle. 
        </t>
        <t>
    For example, as shown in <xref target="fig_vehicular-network-architecture" format="default"/>, 
    when a vehicle (e.g., Vehicle2) is moving from the coverage of an 
    IP-RSU (e.g., IP-RSU1) into the coverage of another IP-RSU (e.g., 
    IP-RSU2) belonging to a different subnet, the IP-RSUs can 
    proactively support the IPv6 mobility of the vehicle while 
    performing the SLAAC, data forwarding, and handover for the sake
    of the vehicle.
        </t>
        <t>
    For a mobility management scheme in a domain, where the
    wireless subnets of multiple IP-RSUs share the same prefix,
    an efficient vehicular-network-wide DAD is required.
    On the other hand, for a mobility
    management scheme with a unique prefix per mobile node (e.g., PMIPv6
    <xref target="RFC5213" format="default"/>),
    DAD is not required because the IPv6 address of a vehicle's external
    wireless interface is guaranteed to be unique. There is a trade-off
    between the prefix usage efficiency and DAD overhead. Thus, the IPv6
    address autoconfiguration for vehicular networks needs to consider
    this trade-off to support efficient mobility management.
        </t>
        <t>
   Even though SLAAC with classic ND costs DAD overhead during 
   mobility management, SLAAC with the registration extension 
   specified in <xref target="RFC8505"/> and/or with AERO/OMNI does not cost DAD overhead. 
    SLAAC for vehicular networks needs to consider the
    minimization of the cost of DAD with the help of an infrastructure
    node (e.g., IP-RSU and MA). Using an infrastructure prefix over VANET
    allows direct routability to the Internet through the multihop V2I toward
    an IP-RSU. On the other hand, a BYOA does not allow such direct
    routability to the Internet since the BYOA is not topologically
    correct, that is, not routable in the Internet. In addition, a
    vehicle configured with a BYOA needs a tunnel home (e.g., IP-RSU)
    connected to the Internet, and the vehicle needs to know which
    neighboring vehicle is reachable inside the VANET toward the tunnel
    home. There is non-negligible control overhead to set up and
    maintain routes to such a tunnel home <xref target="RFC4888" format="default"/> over the VANET.
        </t>
        <t>
    For the case of a multihomed network, a vehicle can follow the
    first-hop router selection rule described in <xref target="RFC8028" format="default"/>.
    For example, an IP-OBU inside a vehicle may connect to an IP-RSU that
    has multiple routers behind. In this scenario, because the IP-OBU
    can have multiple prefixes from those routers, the default router
    selection, source address selection, and packet redirect process
    should follow the guidelines in <xref target="RFC8028" format="default"/>.
    That is, the vehicle should select its default router for each prefix
    by preferring the router that advertised the prefix.
        </t>

    Vehicles can use the TCC as their Home Network having a home agent
    for mobility management as in MIPv6 <xref target="RFC6275" format="default"/>,
    PMIPv6 <xref target="RFC5213" format="default"/>, and NEMO <xref target="RFC3963" format="default"/>, so the TCC (or an MA inside the
    TCC) maintains the mobility information of vehicles for location
    management. Also, in vehicular networks,
    asymmetric links sometimes exist and must be considered for
    wireless communications, such as V2V and V2I.
    <xref target="I-D.jeong-ipwave-vehicular-mobility-management" format="default"/> discusses 
    a Vehicular Mobility Management (VMM) scheme to proactively do handover 
    for vehicles.
        </t>
        <t>
    Therefore, for the proactive and seamless IPv6 mobility of vehicles,
    the vehicular infrastructure (including IP-RSUs and MA) needs to 
    efficiently perform the mobility management of the vehicles with 
    their mobility information and link-layer information.
    Also, in IPv6-based vehicular networking, IPv6 mobility management
    should have minimum changes for the interoperability with the 
    legacy IPv6 mobility management schemes, such as PMIPv6, DMM, LISP,
    and AERO.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
    This section discusses security and privacy for IPv6-based vehicular
    networking. Security and privacy are paramount in V2I, V2V, and V2X 
    networking along with neighbor discovery and mobility 
    management.
      </t>
      <t>
    Vehicles and infrastructure must be authenticated to each other by 
    a password, a key, and/or a fingerprint 
    in order to participate in vehicular networking.
    For the authentication in vehicular networks, the Vehicular Cloud
    needs to support a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) efficiently, as either 
    a dedicated or a co-located component inside a TCC. 
    To provide safe interaction between vehicles
    or between a vehicle and infrastructure, only authenticated
    nodes (i.e., vehicle and infrastructure nodes) can participate
    in vehicular networks.
    Also, in-vehicle devices (e.g., ECUs) and a driver/passenger's mobile
    devices (e.g., smartphones and tablet PCs) in a vehicle need to
    securely communicate with other in-vehicle devices, another
    driver/passenger's mobile devices in another vehicle, or other
    servers behind an IP-RSU.

    Even though a vehicle is perfectly authenticated by another entity 
    and legitimate to use the data generated by another vehicle,
    it may be hacked by malicious applications that track and
    collect its and other vehicles' information.  In this case, an
    attack mitigation process may be required to reduce the aftermath of
    malicious behaviors.
    Note that when a driver/passenger's mobile devices are connected to a 
    vehicle's internal network, the vehicle may be more vulnerable to possible 
    attacks from external networks due to the exposure of its 
    in-flight traffic packets.
    <xref target="I-D.jeong-ipwave-security-privacy" format="default"/>
    discusses several types of threats for Vehicular Security and Privacy (VSP).
      </t>
      <t>
    For secure V2I communication, a secure channel (e.g., IPsec) between
    a mobile router (i.e., IP-OBU) in a vehicle and a fixed router
    (i.e., IP-RSU) in an EN needs to be established, as shown in 
    <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default"/>
        <xref target="RFC4301" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4302" format="default"/>
        <xref target="RFC4303" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC4308" format="default"/>
        <xref target="RFC7296" format="default"/>.
    Also, for secure V2V communication, a secure channel (e.g., IPsec) 
    between a mobile router (i.e., IP-OBU) in a vehicle and a mobile 
    router (i.e., IP-OBU) in another vehicle needs to be established, as 
    shown in <xref target="fig_v2v-internetworking" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	  For secure V2I/V2V communication, an element in a vehicle (e.g., an 
    in-vehicle device and a driver/passenger's mobile device) needs to 
    establish a secure connection (e.g., TLS) with another element in 
    another vehicle or another element in a Vehicular Cloud (e.g., a 
    server).
    Note that any key management approach can be used for the secure
    communication, and particularly for IPv6-based vehicular networks,
    a new or enhanced key management approach resilient to wireless
    networks is required.
      </t>
      <t>    
    IEEE Std 1609.2 <xref target="WAVE-1609.2" format="default"/> specifies
    security services for applications and management messages, but this 
    WAVE specification is optional. 
    Thus, if the link layer does not support the security of a WAVE frame, 
    either the network layer or the
    transport layer needs to support security services for the WAVE
    frame.
      </t>

      <section anchor="section_Security-Threats-in-Neighbor-Discovery" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Security Threats in Neighbor Discovery</name>
        <t> 
        For the classical IPv6 ND (i.e., the legacy ND), DAD is required 
        to ensure the uniqueness of the 
        IPv6 address of a vehicle's wireless interface. This DAD can be 
        used as a flooding attack that uses the DAD-related ND packets
        disseminated over the VANET or vehicular networks. 
        <xref target="RFC6959" format="default"/>
        introduces threats enabled by IP source address spoofing.
        This possibility indicates that vehicles and IP-RSUs need to filter 
        out suspicious ND traffic in advance. 
        <xref target="RFC8928" format="default"/> introduces a mechanism that protects 
        the ownership of an address for 6LoWPAN ND from address theft 
        and impersonation attacks.  
        Based on the SEND mechanism <xref target="RFC3971" format="default"/>, the 
        authentication for routers (i.e., IP-RSUs) can be conducted 
        by only selecting an IP-RSU that has a certification path toward 
        trusted parties. For authenticating other vehicles, 
        Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) can be used to
        verify the true owner of a received ND message, which requires
        using the CGA ND option in the ND protocol.
        This CGA can protect vehicles against DAD flooding 
        by DAD filtering based on the verification for the true owner
        of the received DAD message.
        For a general protection of the ND mechanism, the RSA Signature 
        ND option can also be used to protect the integrity of the
        messages by public key signatures.  For a more advanced
        authentication mechanism, a distributed blockchain-based
        approach <xref target="Vehicular-BlockChain" format="default"/> can be used.
        However, for a scenario where a trustable router or an 
        authentication path cannot be obtained, it is desirable to find
        a solution in which vehicles and infrastructure nodes can
        authenticate each other without any support from a third party. 
        </t>
        <t>
        When applying the classical IPv6 ND process to VANET, one of 
        the security issues is that an IP-RSU (or IP-OBU) as
        a router may receive deliberate or accidental DoS attacks from network 
        scans that probe devices on a VANET. In this scenario, the IP-RSU
        (or IP-OBU) can be overwhelmed by processing the network scan requests
        so that the capacity and resources of the IP-RSU (or IP-OBU) are
        exhausted, causing the failure of receiving normal ND messages from
        other hosts for network address resolution.
        <xref target="RFC6583" format="default"/> describes more about the operational problems
        in the classical IPv6 ND mechanism that can be vulnerable to deliberate
        or accidental DoS attacks and suggests several implementation guidelines
        and operational mitigation techniques for those problems. 
        Nevertheless, for running IPv6 ND in VANET, those issues can be 
        acuter since the movements of vehicles can be so diverse that
        there is a wider opportunity for rogue behaviors, and the failure of
        networking among vehicles may lead to grave consequences.    
        </t>
        <t>
        Strong security measures shall protect vehicles roaming in road
        networks from the attacks of malicious nodes that are controlled
        by hackers.  For safe driving applications (e.g., context-aware
        navigation, cooperative adaptive cruise control, and platooning),
        as explained in <xref target="subsection_V2V-Use-Cases" format="default"/>, the
        cooperative action among vehicles is assumed.  Malicious nodes may
        disseminate wrong driving information (e.g., location, speed, and
        direction) for disturbing safe driving.  For example, a Sybil attack,
        which tries to confuse a vehicle with multiple false identities,
        may disturb a vehicle from taking a safe maneuver.
        Since cybersecurity issues in vehicular networks may cause physical 
        vehicle safety issues, it may be necessary to consider those physical 
        safety concerns when designing protocols in IPWAVE.
        </t>
        <t>
        To identify malicious vehicles among vehicles, an authentication
        method may be required.  A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) (or a
        vehicle manufacturer certificate) and a user certificate (e.g., X.509
        certificate <xref target="RFC5280" format="default"/>) along with an
        in-vehicle device's identifier generation can be used to efficiently
        authenticate a vehicle or its driver (having a user certificate)
        through a road infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU) connected to an
        authentication server in the Vehicular Cloud.  This authentication can
        be used to identify the vehicle that will communicate with an
        infrastructure node or another vehicle.  In the case where a vehicle
        has an internal network (called a mobile network) and elements in the
        network (e.g., in-vehicle devices and a user's mobile devices), as
        shown in <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default"/>,
        the elements in the network need to be authenticated individually for
        safe authentication.  Also, Transport Layer Security (TLS)
        certificates <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/> <xref
        target="RFC5280" format="default"/> can be used for an element's
        authentication to allow secure E2E vehicular communications between an
        element in a vehicle and another element in a server in a Vehicular
        Cloud or between an element in a vehicle and another element in
        another vehicle.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="section_Security-Threats-in-Mobility-Management" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Security Threats in Mobility Management</name>
        <t>
        For mobility management, a malicious vehicle can construct
        multiple virtual bogus vehicles and register them with IP-RSUs
        and MAs.  This registration makes the IP-RSUs and MAs waste their
        resources.  The IP-RSUs and MAs need to determine whether 
        a vehicle is genuine or bogus in mobility management.

        Also, for the confidentiality of control packets and data packets
        between IP-RSUs and MAs, the E2E paths (e.g., tunnels) need to be
        protected by secure communication channels.

        In addition, to prevent bogus IP-RSUs and MAs from interfering with 
        the IPv6 mobility of vehicles, mutual authentication among 
        the IP-RSUs, MAs, and vehicles
        needs to be performed by certificates (e.g., TLS certificate).
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="section_Other-Threats" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Other Threats</name>
        <t>
        For the setup of a secure channel over IPsec or TLS, the multihop V2I
        communications over DSRC or 5G V2X (or LTE V2X) is required on 
        a highway.  In this case, multiple intermediate vehicles as relay
        nodes can help to forward association and authentication messages
        toward an IP-RSU (or gNodeB/eNodeB) connected to an authentication
        server in the Vehicular Cloud. In this kind of process, the
        authentication messages forwarded by each vehicle can be delayed or
        lost, which may increase the construction time of a connection or cause some
        vehicles to not be able to be authenticated.
        </t>
        <t>
    	  Even though vehicles can be authenticated with valid certificates by
        an authentication server in the Vehicular Cloud, the authenticated
        vehicles may harm other vehicles.  To deal with this kind of security
        issue, for monitoring suspicious behaviors, vehicles' communication
        activities can be recorded in either a centralized approach through a
        logging server (e.g., TCC) in the Vehicular Cloud or a decentralized
        approach (e.g., an ECD and blockchain <xref target="Bitcoin" format="default"/>)
        by the help of other vehicles and infrastructure.
        </t>
        <t>
        There are trade-offs between centralized and decentralized approaches
        in logging of vehicles' behaviors (e.g., location, speed, direction,
        acceleration/deceleration, and lane change) and communication
        activities (e.g., transmission time, reception time, and packet types,
        such as TCP, UDP, SCTP, QUIC, HTTP, and HTTPS). 
        A centralized approach is more efficient than a decentralized
        approach in terms of log data collection and processing in a 
        central server in the Vehicular Cloud.
        However, the centralized approach may cause a higher delay than a
        decentralized approach in terms of the analysis of the log data 
        and counteraction in a local ECD or a distributed database like a
        blockchain.
        The centralized approach stores log data collected from VANET into
        a remote logging server in a Vehicular Cloud as a central cloud, so it
        takes time to deliver the log data to a remote logging server.
        On the other hand, the decentralized approach stores the log data
        into a nearby edge computing device as a local logging server or a
        nearby blockchain node, which participates in a blockchain network.
        On the stored log data, an analyzer needs to perform a machine
        learning technique (e.g., deep learning) and seek suspicious behaviors
        of the vehicles.  If such an analyzer is located either within or near
        the edge computing device, it can access the log data with a short
        delay, analyze it quickly, and generate feedback to allow for a quick
        counteraction against such malicious behaviors.  On the other hand,
        if the Vehicular Cloud with the log data is far away from a
        problematic VANET with malicious behaviors, the centralized approach
        takes a longer time with the analysis of the log data and the
        decision-making on malicious behaviors than the decentralized approach.
        If the log data is encrypted by a secret key, it can be protected
        from the observation of a hacker. The secret key sharing among legal
        vehicles, ECDs, and Vehicular Clouds should be supported efficiently.
        </t>
        <t>
        Log data can release privacy breakage of a vehicle.
        The log data can contain the MAC address and IPv6
        address for a vehicle's wireless network interface. If the unique
        MAC address of the wireless network interface is used, a hacker
        can track the vehicle with that MAC address and can track the
        privacy information of the vehicle's driver (e.g., location
        information). To prevent this privacy breakage, a MAC address
        pseudonym can be used for the MAC address of the wireless network
        interface, and the corresponding IPv6 address should be based on
        such a MAC address pseudonym.
        By solving a privacy issue of a vehicle's identity in logging,
        vehicles may observe each other's activities to identify any
        misbehaviors without privacy breakage.  Once identifying a 
        misbehavior, a vehicle shall have a way to either isolate itself 
        from others or isolate a suspicious vehicle by informing 
        other vehicles.
        </t>
        <t>
        For completely secure vehicular networks, we shall embrace the concept
        of "zero-trust" for vehicles where no vehicle is trustable and
        verifying every message  (such as IPv6 control messages including ND,
        DAD, NUD, and application-layer messages) is necessary.  In this way,
        vehicular networks can defend against many possible cyberattacks. Thus, we
        need to have an efficient zero-trust framework or mechanism for
        vehicular networks. 
        </t>
        <t>
        For the non-repudiation of the harmful activities from malicious 
        vehicles, as it is difficult for other normal vehicles to identify them,
        an additional and advanced approach is needed. One possible 
        approach is to use a blockchain-based approach 
        <xref target="Bitcoin" format="default"/> as an IPv6 security checking framework. 
        Each IPv6 packet from a vehicle can be treated as a transaction, and the
        neighboring vehicles can play the role of peers in a consensus 
        method of a blockchain <xref target="Bitcoin" format="default"/>
          <xref target="Vehicular-BlockChain" format="default"/>. For a blockchain's efficient 
        consensus in vehicular networks having fast-moving vehicles, either
        a new consensus algorithm needs to be developed, or an existing 
        consensus algorithm needs to be enhanced. 
        In addition, a consensus-based mechanism for the security of 
        vehicular networks in the IPv6 layer can also be considered.
        A group of servers as blockchain infrastructure can be part of 
        the security checking process in the IP layer.
        </t>
        <t>
        To prevent an adversary from tracking a vehicle with its MAC 
        address or IPv6 address, especially for a long-living transport-layer
        session (e.g., voice call over IP and video streaming service),
        a MAC address pseudonym needs to be provided to each vehicle; 
        that is, each vehicle periodically updates its MAC address, and
        the vehicle's IPv6 address needs to be updated accordingly by the MAC
        address change <xref target="RFC4086" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8981" format="default"/>. 
        Such an update of the MAC and IPv6 addresses should not 
        interrupt the E2E communications between two vehicles (or 
        between a vehicle and an IP-RSU) for a long-living transport-layer
        session.  However, if this pseudonym is performed without strong 
        E2E confidentiality  (using either IPsec or TLS), there will be no
        privacy benefit from changing MAC and IPv6 addresses because an
        adversary can observe the change of the MAC and IPv6 addresses and
        track the vehicle with those addresses. Thus, the MAC address
        pseudonym and the IPv6 address update should be performed with strong
        E2E confidentiality.
        </t>
        <t>
        The privacy exposure to the TCC via V2I is mostly about the
        location information of vehicles and may also include other in-vehicle
        activities, such as transactions of credit cards.  The assumed,
        trusted actors are the owner of a vehicle, an authorized vehicle
        service provider (e.g., navigation service provider), and an
        authorized vehicle manufacturer for providing after-sales services.
        In addition, privacy concerns for excessively collecting vehicle
        activities from roadway operators, such as public transportation
        administrators and private contractors, may also pose threats on
        violating privacy rights of vehicles.  It might be interesting to find
        a solution from a technological point of view along with public policy
        development for the issue.
        </t>
        <t>
        The "multicasting" of the location information of a VRU's smartphone
        means IPv6 multicasting.  There is a possible security attack related
        to this multicasting.  Attackers can use "fake identifiers" as source
        IPv6 addresses of their devices to generate IPv6 packets and multicast
        them to nearby vehicles in order to cause confusion that those
        vehicles are surrounded by other vehicles or pedestrians.  As a result,
        navigation services (e.g., Google Maps <xref target="Google-Maps" format="default"/> and Waze <xref target="Waze" format="default"/>)
        can be confused with fake road traffic by those vehicles or smartphones
        with "fake identifiers" <xref target="Fake-Identifier-Attack" format="default"/>.  
        This attack with "fake identifiers" should be detected and handled by
        vehicular networks.  To cope with this attack, both legal vehicles and
        legal VRUs' smartphones can be registered with a TCC and their locations
        can be tracked by the TCC.  With this tracking, the TCC can tell the
        road traffic conditions caused by those vehicles and smartphones.
        In addition, to prevent hackers from tracking the locations of those
        vehicles and smartphones, either a MAC address pseudonym
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-madinas-mac-address-randomization" format="default"/>
        or secure IPv6 address generation <xref target="RFC7721" format="default"/> 
        can be used to protect the privacy of those vehicles and smartphones.

<section anchor="appendix_Support-of-Multiple-Radio-Technologies-for-V2V" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Support of Multiple Radio Technologies for V2V</name>
      <t>
    Vehicular networks may consist of multiple radio technologies, such as 
    DSRC and 5G V2X (or LTE V2X).  Although a Layer 2 solution can provide support for 
    multihop communications in vehicular networks, the scalability issue 
    related to multihop forwarding still remains when vehicles need to 
    disseminate or forward packets toward destinations that are multiple hops away.  In 
    addition, the IPv6-based approach for V2V as a network-layer protocol can 
    accommodate multiple radio technologies as MAC protocols, such as DSRC and 
    5G V2X (or LTE V2X). Therefore, the existing IPv6 protocol can be augmented through the 
    addition of a virtual interface (e.g., OMNI 
    <xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-omni" format="default"/> 
    and DLEP <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>) and/or 
    protocol changes in order to support both wireless single-hop/multihop V2V 
    communications and multiple radio technologies in vehicular networks.
    In such a way, vehicles can communicate with each other by V2V 
    communications to share either an emergency situation or road hazard 
    information on a highway having multiple radio technologies.

    <section anchor="appendix_Support-of-Multihop-V2X" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Support of Multihop V2X Networking</name>
      <t>
    The multihop V2X networking can be supported by
    RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) 
    <xref target="RFC6550" format="default"/> and Overlay Multilink Network  
    Interface <xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-omni" format="default"/> with 
    AERO <xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-aero" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
    RPL defines an IPv6 routing protocol for Low-Power and Lossy 
    Networks (LLNs) as being mostly designed for home automation routing, 
    building automation routing, industrial routing, and urban 
    LLN routing. It uses a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DODAG) to construct routing paths for hosts
    (e.g., IoT devices) in a network. The DODAG uses an Objective
    Function (OF) for route selection and optimization within the
    network. A user can use different routing metrics to define an OF
    for a specific scenario. RPL supports multipoint-to-point,
    point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point traffic; and the major
    traffic flow is the multipoint-to-point traffic. For example, in
    a highway scenario, a vehicle may not access an IP-RSU directly
    because of the distance of the DSRC coverage (up to 1 km). In
    this case, the RPL can be extended to support a multihop V2I
    since a vehicle can take advantage of other vehicles as relay
    nodes to reach the IP-RSU. Also, RPL can be extended to support both
    multihop V2V and V2X in the similar way.
      </t>
      <t>
    RPL is primarily designed to minimize the control plane activity,
    which is the relative amount of routing protocol exchanges versus data
    traffic; this approach is beneficial for situations where the power
    and bandwidth are scarce (e.g., an IoT LLN where RPL is typically 
    used today), but also in situations of high relative mobility between 
    the nodes in the network (also known as swarming, e.g., within a variable set of 
    vehicles with a similar global motion, or a variable set of drones flying 
    toward the same direction).
      </t>
      <t>
    To reduce the routing exchanges, RPL leverages a Distance Vector (DV) 
    approach, which does not need a global knowledge of the topology, 
    and only optimizes the routes to and from the root, allowing 
    peer-to-peer (P2P) paths to be stretched. Although RPL installs its
    routes proactively, it only maintains them lazily, that is, in
    reaction to actual traffic or as a slow background activity.
    Additionally, RPL leverages the concept of an OF,
    which allows adapting the activity of the routing
    protocol to use cases, e.g., type, speed, and quality of the
    radios. RPL does not need to converge and provides connectivity to 
    most nodes most of the time. The default route toward the root is
    maintained aggressively and may change while a packet progresses
    without causing loops, so the packet will still reach the root.

    There are two modes for routing in RPL: non-storing mode
    and storing mode. In non-storing mode, a node inside the
    mesh or swarm that changes its point(s) of attachment to the graph
    informs the root with a single unicast packet flowing along the
    default route, and the connectivity is restored immediately; this
    mode is preferable for use cases where Internet connectivity is
    dominant. On the other hand, in storing mode, the routing stretch
    is reduced for better P2P connectivity, and the Internet
    connectivity is restored more slowly during the time for the DV
    operation to operate hop-by-hop. While an RPL topology can
    quickly scale up and down and fit the needs of mobility of
    vehicles, the total performance of the system will also depend on
    how quickly a node can form an address, join the mesh (including
    Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)), and manage
    its global mobility to become reachable from another node outside
    the mesh.

    OMNI defines a protocol for the transmission of IPv6 packets over 
    Overlay Multilink Network Interfaces that are virtual interfaces 
    governing multiple physical network interfaces. 
    OMNI supports multihop V2V communication between vehicles
    in multiple forwarding hops via intermediate vehicles with OMNI links. 
    It also supports multihop V2I communication between a vehicle and an 
    infrastructure access point by multihop V2V communication.
    The OMNI interface supports an NBMA link model where multihop V2V and
    V2I communications use each mobile node's ULAs without need for any DAD
    or MLD messaging.
      </t>
      <t>
    In the OMNI protocol, an OMNI virtual interface can have a ULA
    <xref target="RFC4193" format="default"/> indeed, but wireless physical
    interfaces associated with the OMNI virtual interface can use any prefixes.
    The ULA supports both V2V and V2I multihop forwarding within the
    vehicular network (e.g., via a VANET routing protocol) while each
    vehicle can communicate with Internet correspondents using
    IPv6 global addresses via OMNI interface encapsulation over the wireless
    interface.
      </t>
      <t>
    For the control traffic overhead for running both vehicular ND and a VANET 
    routing protocol, the AERO/OMNI approach may avoid this issue by using
    MANET routing protocols only (i.e., no multicast of IPv6 ND messaging) in
    the wireless underlay network while applying efficient unicast IPv6 ND
    messaging in the OMNI overlay on an as-needed basis for router discovery
    and NUD. This greatly reduces the overhead for VANET-wide multicasting
    while providing agile accommodation for dynamic topology changes.

    <section anchor="appendix_Support-of-Mobility-Management" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Support of Mobility Management for V2I</name>
      <t>
    The seamless application communication between two vehicles or 
    between a vehicle
    and an infrastructure node requires mobility management 
    in vehicular networks.
    The mobility management schemes include a host-based mobility scheme,
    network-based mobility scheme, and software-defined networking scheme. 
      </t>
      <t>	
    In the host-based mobility scheme (e.g., MIPv6), an IP-RSU plays the role
    of a home agent. On the other hand, in the network-based mobility scheme
    (e.g., PMIPv6), an MA plays the role of a mobility management controller,
    such as a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in PMIPv6, which also serves
    vehicles as a home agent, and an IP-RSU plays the role of an access router,
    such as a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in PMIPv6 <xref target="RFC5213" format="default"/>. 
	  The host-based mobility scheme needs client functionality in the
    IPv6 stack of a vehicle as a mobile node for mobility signaling 
	  message exchange between the vehicle and home agent.
    On the other hand, the network-based mobility scheme does not 
    need such client functionality of a vehicle because the network
    infrastructure node (e.g., MAG in PMIPv6) as a proxy mobility agent 
    handles the mobility signaling message exchange with the home agent
    (e.g., LMA in PMIPv6) for the sake of the vehicle.
      </t>
      <t>
    There are a scalability issue and a route optimization issue in the
    network-based mobility scheme (e.g., PMIPv6) when an MA covers a
    large vehicular network governing many IP-RSUs. In this case, a
    distributed mobility scheme (e.g., DMM <xref target="RFC7429" format="default"/>)
    can mitigate the scalability issue by distributing multiple MAs in
    the vehicular network such that they are positioned closer to
    vehicles for route optimization and bottleneck mitigation in a
    central MA in the network-based mobility scheme.
    All these mobility approaches (i.e., a host-based mobility scheme,
    network-based mobility scheme, and distributed mobility scheme) and
    a hybrid approach of a combination of them need to provide an
    efficient mobility service to vehicles moving fast and moving along
    with relatively predictable trajectories along the roadways.
      </t>
      <t>
    In vehicular networks, the control plane can be separated from
    the data plane for efficient mobility management and data forwarding
    by using the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) 
    <xref target="RFC7149" format="default"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp" format="default"/>. 
    Note that Forwarding Policy Configuration (FPC) in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp" format="default"/>,
	  which is a flexible mobility management system, can manage the
    separation of data plane and control plane in DMM.
	  In SDN, the control plane and data plane are separated for the
    efficient management of forwarding elements (e.g., switches and
    routers) where an SDN controller configures the forwarding elements
    in a centralized way, and they perform packet forwarding according to
    their forwarding tables that are configured by the SDN controller.
    An MA as an SDN controller needs to efficiently configure and
    monitor its IP-RSUs and vehicles for mobility management and security services.

    <section anchor="appendix_Support-of-MTU-Diversity" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Support of MTU Diversity for IP-Based Vehicular Networks</name>
      <t>
    The wireless and/or wired-line links in paths between both mobile
    nodes and fixed network correspondents may configure a variety of
    Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs), where all IPv6 links are required
    to support a minimum MTU of 1280 octets and may  support larger MTUs.
    Unfortunately, determining the path MTU (i.e., the minimum link MTU
    in the path) has proven to be inefficient and unreliable due to the
    uncertain nature of the loss-oriented ICMPv6 messaging service used
    for path MTU discovery. Recent developments have produced a more
    reliable path MTU determination service for TCP <xref target="RFC4821" format="default"/> 
    and UDP <xref target="RFC8899" format="default"/>; however, the MTUs discovered are 
    always limited by the most
    restrictive link MTU in the path (often 1500 octets or smaller).
      </t>
      <t>
    The AERO/OMNI service addresses the MTU issue by introducing a new
    layer in the Internet architecture known as the "OMNI Adaptation Layer
    (OAL)". The OAL allows end systems that configure an OMNI interface
    to utilize a full 65535-octet MTU by leveraging the IPv6 fragmentation
    and reassembly service during encapsulation to produce fragment sizes
    that are assured of traversing the path without loss due to a
    size restriction. Thus, this allows end systems to send packets that are
    often much larger than the actual path MTU.
      </t>
      <t> 
    Performance studies over the course of many decades have proven that
    applications will see greater performance by sending smaller numbers
    of large packets (as opposed to larger numbers of small packets) even
    if fragmentation is needed. The OAL further supports even larger packet
    sizes through the IP Parcels construct 
    <xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-parcels" format="default"/>,
    which provides "packets-in-packet" encapsulation for a total size up
    to 4 MB. Together, the OAL and IP Parcels will provide a revolutionary
    new capability for greater efficiency in both mobile and fixed networks.
    On the other hand, due to the highly dynamic nature of vehicular networks, 
    a high packet loss may not be able to be avoided. The high packet 
    loss on IP Parcels can simultaneously cause multiple TCP sessions 
    to experience packet retransmissions, session time-out, or 
    re-establishment of the sessions. Other protocols, such as MPTCP and 
    QUIC, may also experience similar issues. A mechanism for 
    mitigating this issue in OAL and IP Parcels should be considered.
