    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines how to use the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework to distribute keying material and configuration parameters for secure group communication. Candidate group members that act as Clients and are authorized to join a group can do so by interacting with a Key Distribution Center (KDC) acting as the Resource Server, from which they obtain the keying material to communicate with other group members. While defining general message formats as well as the interface and operations available at the KDC, this document supports different approaches and protocols for secure group communication. Therefore, details are delegated to separate application profiles of this document as specialized instances that target a particular group communication approach and define how communications in the group are protected. Compliance requirements for such application profiles are also specified.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document builds on the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework and defines how to request, distribute, and renew keying material and configuration parameters to protect message exchanges in a group communication environment.</t>
      <t>Candidate group members that act as ACE Clients and are authorized to join a group can interact with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) acting as the ACE Resource Server that is responsible for that group in order to obtain the necessary keying material and parameters to communicate with other group members.</t>
      <t>In particular, this document defines the operations and interface available at the KDC, as well as general message formats for the interactions between Clients and the KDC. At the same time, communications in the group can rely on different approaches, e.g., based on multicast <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis"/> or publish-subscribe (pub-sub) messaging <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub"/>, and can be protected in different ways.</t>
      <t>Therefore, this document delegates details on the communication and security approaches used in a group to separate application profiles. These are specialized instances of this document that target a particular group communication approach and define how communications in the group are protected, as well as the specific keying material and configuration parameters provided to group members.</t>
      <t>In order to ensure consistency and aid the development of such application profiles, <xref target="req"/> of this document defines a number of related compliance requirements. In particular, <xref target="req-mandatory"/> compiles the requirements that application profiles are <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> to fulfill; these are referred to by an identifier that starts with "REQ". Instead, <xref target="req-optional"/> compiles the requirements that application profiles <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> fulfill; these are referred to by an identifier that starts with "OPT".</t>
      <t>New keying material is intended to be generated and distributed to the group upon membership changes (rekeying). If the application requires backward security (i.e., new group members must be prevented from accessing communications in the group prior to their joining), then a rekeying has to occur every time new members join the group. If the application requires forward security (i.e., former group members must be prevented from accessing communications in the group after their leaving), then a rekeying has to occur every time current members leave or are evicted from the group.</t>
      <t>A group rekeying scheme performs the actual distribution of the new keying material by rekeying the current group members when a new Client joins the group and rekeying the remaining group members when a Client leaves the group. This can rely on different approaches, including efficient group rekeying schemes such as those described in <xref target="RFC2093"/>, <xref target="RFC2094"/>, and <xref target="RFC2627"/>.</t>
      <t>Consistently with what is recommended in the ACE framework, this document uses Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref target="RFC8949"/> for data encoding. However, using JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> instead of CBOR is possible by relying on the conversion method specified in Sections <xref target="RFC8949" section="6.1" sectionFormat="bare"/> and <xref target="RFC8949" section="6.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref target="RFC8949"/>.</t>
      <section anchor="terminology">
        <name>Terminology</name>
        <t>The key words "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>", "<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL

"<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>", and "<bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
        <t>Readers are expected to be familiar with the following:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The terms and concepts described in the ACE framework <xref target="RFC9200"/> and in the Authorization Information Format (AIF) <xref target="RFC9237"/> to express authorization information. The terminology for entities in the considered architecture is defined in OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/>. In particular, this includes Client (C), Resource Server (RS), and Authorization Server (AS).</li>
          <li>The terms and concepts described in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/>. The term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth definition, aimed at denoting resources such as /token and /introspect at the AS  and /authz-info at the RS. This document does not use the CoAP definition of "endpoint", which is "An entity participating in the CoAP protocol".</li>
          <li>The terms and concepts described in Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610"/>, CBOR <xref target="RFC8949"/>, and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) <xref target="RFC9052"/> <xref target="RFC9053"/> <xref target="RFC9338"/>.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>A node interested in participating in group communication, as well as one that is already participating as a group member, is interchangeably denoted as "Client".</t>
        <t>This document also uses the following terms.</t>
        <dl spacing="normal">
        
            <dt>Group:</dt><dd><t>A set of nodes that share common keying material and security parameters used to protect their communications with one another. That is, the term refers to a "security group".</t>
            <t>
This term is not to be confused with an "application group", which has relevance at the application level and whose members share a common pool of resources or content. Examples of application groups are the set of all nodes deployed in a same physical room or the set of nodes registered to a pub-sub topic.  </t>
            <t>
This term is also not to be confused with a "multicast group", which has relevance at the network level and whose members all listen to a group network address for receiving messages sent to that group. An example of a multicast group is the set of nodes that are configured to receive messages that are sent to the group's associated IP multicast address.  </t>
            <t>
The same security group might be associated with multiple application groups. Also, the same application group might be associated with multiple security groups. Further details and considerations on the mapping between the three types of groups are out of the scope of this document.</t>
          </dd>
          <dt>Key Distribution Center (KDC):</dt>
	  <dd>The entity responsible for managing one or multiple groups, with particular reference to the group membership and the keying material to use for protecting group communications.</dd>
        </dl>

        <t>Furthermore, this document uses "names" or "identifiers" for groups and nodes. Their different meanings are summarized below.</t>

        <dl spacing="normal">
          <dt>Group name:</dt><dd>The identifier of a group as a text string encoded as UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/>. Once established, it is invariant. It is used in the interactions between the Client, AS, and RS to identify a group. A group name is always unique among the group names of the existing groups under the same KDC.</dd>
          <dt>GROUPNAME:</dt><dd>The text string used in URIs to identify a group. Once established, it is invariant. GROUPNAME uniquely maps to the group name of a group, although they do not necessarily coincide.</dd>
          <dt>Group identifier:</dt><dd>The identifier of the group keying material used in a group. Unlike group name and GROUPNAME, this identifier changes over time when the group keying material is updated.</dd>
          <dt>Node name:</dt><dd>The identifier of a node as a text string encoded as UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/> and consistent with the semantics of URI path segments (see <xref section="3.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC3986"/>). Once established, it is invariant. It is used in the interactions between the Client and RS, as well as to identify a member of a group. A node name is always unique among the node names of the current nodes within a group.</dd>
          <dt>NODENAME:</dt><dd>The text string used in URIs to identify a member of a group. Once established, it is invariant. Its value coincides with the node name of the associated group member.</dd>
        </dl>

        <t>This document additionally uses the following terminology:</t>
        <dl spacing="normal">
          <dt>Transport profile:</dt><dd>A profile of the ACE framework as per <xref section="5.8.4.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>. 
A transport profile specifies the communication protocol and communication security protocol between an ACE Client and Resource Server, as well as proof-of-possession methods if it supports proof-of-possession access tokens. Transport profiles of ACE include, for instance, those described in <xref target="RFC9202"/>, <xref target="RFC9203"/>, and <xref target="RFC9431"/>.</dd>
          <dt>Application profile:</dt><dd>A profile that defines how applications enforce and use supporting security services they require. These services may include, for instance, provisioning, revocation, and distribution of keying material. An application profile may define specific procedures and message formats.</dd>
          <dt>Authentication credential:</dt><dd>The set of information associated with an entity, including that entity's public key and parameters associated with the public key. Examples of authentication credentials are CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) and CWT Claims Sets (CCSs) <xref target="RFC8392"/>, X.509 certificates <xref target="RFC5280"/>, and C509 certificates <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert"/>.</dd>
          <dt>Individual keying material:</dt><dd>Information pertaining exclusively to a group member, as associated with its group membership and related to other keying material and parameters used in the group. For example, this can be an identifier that the secure communication protocol employs to uniquely identify a node as a group member (e.g., a cryptographic key identifier uniquely associated with the group member in question). The specific nature and format of individual keying material used in a group is defined in the application profiles of this specification. The individual keying material of a group member is not related to the secure association between that group member and the KDC.</dd>
        </dl>

        <t>Throughout this document, examples for CBOR data items are expressed in CBOR extended diagnostic notation as defined in <xref target="RFC8949" sectionFormat="of" section="8"/> and <xref target="RFC8610" sectionFormat="of" section="G"/> ("diagnostic notation"), unless noted otherwise. We often use diagnostic notation comments to provide a textual representation of the parameters' keys and values.</t>

      <t>At a high level, the key provisioning process is separated in two phases: the first one follows the ACE framework between the Client, AS, and KDC, while the second one is the actual key distribution between the Client and KDC. After the two phases are completed, the Client is able to participate in the group communication via a Dispatcher entity.</t>

      <t>The following participants (see <xref target="fig-roles"/>) take part in the authorization and key distribution.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Client (C): A node that wants to join a group and take part in group communication with other group members. Within the group, the Client can have different roles.</li>
        <li>Authorization Server (AS): As per the AS defined in the ACE framework <xref target="RFC9200"/>, it enforces access policies that prescribe whether a node is allowed to join a given group or not and with what roles and rights (e.g., write and/or read).</li>
        <li>Key Distribution Center (KDC): An entity that maintains the keying material to protect group communications and provides it to Clients authorized to join a given group. During the first phase of the process (<xref target="sec-auth"/>), the KDC takes the role of the RS in the ACE framework. During the second phase of the process (<xref target="key-distr"/>), which is not based on the ACE framework, the KDC distributes the keying material. In addition, the KDC provides the latest keying material to group members when requested or, if required by the application, when group membership changes.</li>
	<li><t>Group members: Nodes that have joined a group where they take part in group communication with one another, protecting it with the group keying material obtained from the KDC.</t>
      </li>
          <li><t>Dispatcher: An entity through which the Clients communicate with the group when sending a message intended for multiple group members. That is, the Dispatcher distributes such a one-to-many message to the group members as intended recipients. The Dispatcher does not have access to the group keying material. A single-recipient message intended for only one group member may be delivered by alternative means, i.e., with no assistance from the Dispatcher.  </t>
          <t>
Examples of a Dispatcher are: the Broker in a pub-sub setting; a relayer for group communication that delivers group messages as multiple unicast messages to all group members; and an implicit entity as in a multicast communication setting, where messages are transmitted to a multicast IP address and delivered on the transport channel.  </t>
          <t>
If it consists of an explicit entity, such as a pub-sub Broker or a message relayer, the Dispatcher is comparable to an untrusted on-path intermediary; as such, it is able to see the messages sent by Clients in the group but not able to decrypt them and read their plain content.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Authorizing a Client to join the group (<xref target="sec-auth"/>) and providing it with the group keying material to communicate with the other group members (<xref target="key-distr"/>),</li>
        <li>Allowing a group member to retrieve group keying material (Sections <xref target="ssec-key-material-retrieval" format="counter"/> and <xref target="update-keys" format="counter"/>),</li>
        <li>Allowing a group member to retrieve authentication credentials of other group members (<xref target="sec-key-retrieval"/>) and to provide an updated authentication credential (<xref target="update-pub-key"/>),</li>
        <li>Allowing a group member to leave the group (<xref target="ssec-group-leaving"/>),</li>
        <li>Evicting a group member from the group (<xref target="sec-node-removal"/>), and</li>

          <t>Renewing and redistributing the group keying material (rekeying), e.g., upon a membership change in the group (<xref target="sec-group-rekeying"/>).  </t>
          <t>
Rekeying the group may result in a temporary misalignment of the keying material stored by the different group members. Different situations where this can happen and how they can be handled are discussed in <xref target="sec-misalignment-keying-material"/>.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t><xref target="fig-flow"/> provides a high-level overview of the message flow for a node joining a group. The message flow can be expanded as follows.</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t>The joining node requests an access token from the AS in order to access one or more group-membership resources at the KDC and hence join the associated groups.  </t>
          <t>
This exchange between the Client and AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be secured, as specified by the transport profile of ACE used between the Client and KDC. Based on the response from the AS, the joining node will establish or continue using a secure communication association with the KDC.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The joining node transfers authentication and authorization information to the KDC by transferring the obtained access token. This is typically achieved by including the access token in a request sent to the /authz-info endpoint at the KDC.  </t>
          <t>
Once this exchange is completed, the joining node <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have a secure communication association established with the KDC before joining a group under that KDC.  </t>
          <t>
This exchange and the following secure communications between the Client and the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> occur in accordance with the transport profile of ACE used between the Client and KDC, such as the DTLS transport profile of ACE <xref target="RFC9202"/> or the OSCORE transport profile of ACE <xref target="RFC9203"/>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The joining node starts the joining process to become a member of the group by sending a request to the related group-membership resource at the KDC. Based on the application requirements and policies, the KDC may perform a group rekeying by generating new group keying material and distributing it to the current group members through the rekeying scheme used in the group.  </t>
          <t>
At the end of the joining process, the joining node has received the parameters and group keying material from the KDC to securely communicate with the other group members. Also, the KDC has stored the association between the authorization information from the access token and the secure communication association with the joining node.</t>
        </li>
        <li>The joining node and the KDC maintain the secure communication association to support possible future communications. These especially include key management operations, such as the retrieval of updated keying material or the participation in a group rekeying process.</li>
        <li>The joining node can communicate securely with the other group members by using the keying material obtained in step 3.</li>

      <name>Authorization to Join a Group</name>
      <t>This section describes in detail the format of messages exchanged by the participants when a node requests access to a given group. This exchange is based on ACE <xref target="RFC9200"/>.</t>
      <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC9200"/>, the Client asks the AS for the authorization to join the group through the KDC (see <xref target="ssec-authorization-request"/>). If the request is approved and authorization is granted, the AS provides the Client with a proof-of-possession access token and parameters to securely communicate with the KDC (see <xref target="ssec-authorization-response"/>).</t>
      <t>Communications between the Client and the AS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be secured according to what is defined by the used transport profile of ACE. The Content-Format used in the message also depends on the used transport profile of ACE. 
For example, it can be "application/ace+cbor" for the first two messages and "application/cwt" for the third message, which are defined in the ACE framework.</t>
      <t>The transport profile of ACE also defines a number of details, such as the communication and security protocols used with the KDC (see <xref target="RFC9200" sectionFormat="of" section="C"/>).</t>
      <t><xref target="fig-group-member-registration"/> gives an overview of the exchange described above.</t>

            <t>
This parameter is encoded as a CBOR byte string, which wraps a CBOR array of scope entries. All the scope entries are specified according to the same format, i.e., either the Authorization Information Format (AIF) or the textual format defined below.  </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
                <t>If AIF is used, each scope entry is encoded as per <xref target="RFC9237"/>, i.e., as a CBOR array [Toid, Tperm]. If a scope entry expresses a set of roles to take in a group as per this document, the object identifier "Toid" specifies the group name and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be encoded as a CBOR text string, while the permission set "Tperm" specifies the roles that the Client wishes to take in the group.      </t>
                <t>
AIF is the default format for application profiles of this specification and is preferable for those that aim for a compact encoding of scope. This is especially desirable for application profiles defining several roles, with the Client possibly asking for multiple roles combined.      </t>

                <ul spacing="normal">
                  <li>As the first element, the group name, encoded as a CBOR text string.</li>
                  <li>Optionally, as the second element, the role or CBOR array of roles that the Client wishes to take in the group. This element is optional since roles may have been pre-assigned to the Client, as associated with its verifiable identity credentials. Alternatively, the application may have defined a single, well-known role for the target resource(s) and audience(s).</li>

It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles of this specification to specify the exact format and encoding of scope (<xref target="req1" format="none">REQ1</xref>). This includes defining the set of possible roles and their identifiers, as well as the corresponding encoding to use in the scope entries according to the used scope format.  </t>
            <t>
If the application profile uses AIF, it is also <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> to register its specific instance of "Toid" and "Tperm", as well as the corresponding media type and Content-Format, as per the guidelines in <xref target="RFC9237"/> (<xref target="req2" format="none">REQ2</xref>).  </t>
            <t>
If the application profile uses the textual format, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> additionally specify CBOR values to use for abbreviating the role identifiers (<xref target="opt1" format="none">OPT1</xref>).</t>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>a confirmation claim (for example, see 'cnf' defined in <xref section="3.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8747"/> for CWTs)</li>
          <li>an expiration time claim (for example, see 'exp' defined in <xref section="3.1.4" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8392"/> for CWTs)</li>
          <li>
            <t>a scope claim (for example, see 'scope' registered in <xref section="8.14" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/> for CWTs)</t>
            <t>If the 'scope' parameter is present in the Authorization Response, this claim specifies the same access control information as in the 'scope' parameter. Instead, if the 'scope' parameter is not present in the Authorization Response, this claim specifies the same access control information as in the 'scope' parameter of the Authorization Request, if the parameter is present therein, or the default scope that the AS is granting the Client otherwise.</t>
            <t>
By default, this claim has the same encoding as the 'scope' parameter in the Authorization Request, as defined in <xref target="ssec-authorization-request"/>.  </t>
            <t>
Optionally, an alternative extended format of scope defined in <xref target="sec-extended-scope"/> can be used. This format explicitly signals the semantics used to express the actual access control information, which has to be parsed. This enables a Resource Server to correctly process a received access token, also in case:  </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>The Resource Server implements a KDC that supports multiple application profiles of this specification using different scope semantics and/or</li>
              <li>The Resource Server implements further services beyond a KDC for group communication using different scope semantics.</li>
            </ul>
            <t>
If the Authorization Server is aware that this applies to the Resource Server for which the access token is issued, the Authorization Server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the extended format of scope defined in <xref target="sec-extended-scope"/>.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The access token <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> additionally contain other claims that the transport profile of ACE or other optional parameters require.</t>
        <t>When receiving an Authorization Request from a Client that was previously authorized and for which the AS still stores a valid non-expired access token, the AS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> reply with that token. Note that it is up to application profiles of ACE to make sure that reposting the same access token does not cause reuse of keying material between nodes (for example, that is accomplished with the use of random nonces in <xref target="RFC9203"/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="token-post">
        <name>Token Transferring</name>
        <t>The Client sends a Token Transfer Request to the KDC, i.e., a CoAP POST request including the access token and targeting the /authz-info endpoint (see <xref section="5.10.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>).</t>
        <t>Note that this request deviates from the one defined in <xref target="RFC9200"/>, since it allows asking the KDC for additional information concerning the authentication credentials used in the group to ensure source authentication, as well as for possible additional group parameters.</t>
        <t>The joining node <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> ask for this information from the KDC through the same Token Transfer Request.
	In this case, the message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/ace+cbor" registered in <xref section="8.16" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>, and the message payload <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be formatted as a CBOR map, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the access token. The CBOR map <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> additionally include the following parameter, which, if included, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the format and value as specified below.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>'sign_info': defined in <xref target="sign-info"/>, specifying the CBOR simple value <tt>null</tt> (0xf6) to request information about the signature algorithm, the signature algorithm parameters, the signature key parameters, and the exact format of authentication credentials used in the groups that the Client has been authorized to join.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Alternatively, such information may be pre-configured on the joining node or may be retrieved by alternative means. For example, the joining node may have performed an early group discovery process and obtained the link to the associated group-membership resource at the KDC, along with attributes that describe the group configuration (e.g., see <xref target="I-D.tiloca-core-oscore-discovery"/>).</t>
        <t>After successful verification, the Client is authorized to receive the group keying material from the KDC and join the group. Hence, the KDC replies to the Client with a Token Transfer Response, i.e., a  CoAP 2.01 (Created) response.</t>
        <t>The Token Transfer Response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/ace+cbor", and its payload is a CBOR map. Note that this deviates from what is defined in the ACE framework, where the response from the /authz-info endpoint is defined as conveying no payload (see <xref section="5.10.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>).</t>
        <t>If a scope entry in the access token specifies a role that requires the Client to send its own authentication credential to the KDC when joining the related group, then the CBOR map <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the 'kdcchallenge' parameter defined in <xref target="kdcchallenge"/>, specifying a dedicated challenge N_S generated by the KDC.</t>
        <t>Later, when joining the group (see <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>), the Client uses the 'kdcchallenge' value and additional information to build a proof-of-possession (PoP) input. In turn, this is used to compute the PoP evidence that the Client also provides to the KDC, in order to prove possession of its own private key (see the 'client_cred_verify' parameter in <xref target="gid-post"/>).</t>
        <t>While storing the access token, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> store the 'kdcchallenge' value associated with the Client at least until it receives a Join Request from the Client (see <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>) to be able to verify the PoP evidence provided during the join process and thus that the Client possesses its own private key. The KDC deletes the 'kdcchallenge' value associated with the Client upon deleting the access token (e.g., upon its expiration, see <xref section="5.10.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>).</t>
        <t>The same 'kdcchallenge' value <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be reused several times by the Client to generate new PoP evidence, e.g., in case the Client provides the KDC with a new authentication credential while being a group member (see <xref target="update-pub-key"/>) or joins a different group where it intends to use a different authentication credential. Therefore, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the KDC keeps storing the 'kdcchallenge' value after the first join is processed as well. If, upon receiving a Join Request from a Client, the KDC has already discarded the 'kdcchallenge' value, that will trigger an error response with a newly generated 'kdcchallenge' value that the Client can use to restart the join process, as specified in <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>.</t>
        <t>If 'sign_info' is included in the Token Transfer Request, the KDC <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> include the 'sign_info' parameter in the Token Transfer Response, as per the format defined in <xref target="sign-info"/>. Note that the field 'id' of each 'sign_info_entry' specifies the name or array of group names to which that 'sign_info_entry' applies. As an exception, the KDC <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> omit the 'sign_info' parameter in the Token Transfer Response even if 'sign_info' is included in the Token Transfer Request in case none of the groups that the Client is authorized to join use signatures to achieve source authentication.</t>
        <t>Note that the CBOR map specified as payload of the 2.01 (Created) response may include further parameters, e.g., according to the used transport profile of ACE. Application profiles of this specification <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> define additional parameters to use within this exchange (<xref target="opt2" format="none">OPT2</xref>).</t>
        <t>Application profiles of this specification <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> define alternative specific negotiations of parameter values for the signature algorithm and signature keys if 'sign_info' is not used (<xref target="opt3" format="none">OPT3</xref>).</t>
        <t>If allowed by the used transport profile of ACE, the Client may provide the access token to the KDC by other means than the Token Transfer Request. An example is the DTLS transport profile of ACE, where the Client can provide the access token to the KDC during the secure session establishment (see <xref section="3.3.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9202"/>).</t>
        <section anchor="sign-info">
          <name>'sign_info' Parameter</name>
          <t>The 'sign_info' parameter is an <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> parameter of the request and response messages exchanged between the Client and the /authz-info endpoint at the RS (see <xref section="5.10.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>).</t>
          <t>This parameter allows the Client and the RS to exchange information about a signature algorithm and about authentication credentials to accordingly use for signature verification. Its exact semantics and content are application specific.</t>
          <t>In this specification and in application profiles building on it, this parameter is used to exchange information about the signature algorithm and about authentication credentials to be used with it in the groups indicated by the transferred access token as per its 'scope' claim (see <xref target="ssec-authorization-response"/>).</t>
          <t>When used in the Token Transfer Request sent to the KDC (see <xref target="token-post"/>), the 'sign_info' parameter specifies the CBOR simple value <tt>null</tt> (0xf6). This is done to ask for information about the signature algorithm and about the authentication credentials used in the groups that, as per the granted roles, the Client has been authorized to join or interact with (e.g., as an external signature verifier).</t>
          <t>When used in the following Token Transfer Response from the KDC (see <xref target="token-post"/>), the 'sign_info' parameter is a CBOR array of one or more elements. The number of elements is at most the number of groups that the Client has been authorized to join or interact with. Each element contains information about signing parameters and about authentication credentials for one or more groups and is formatted as follows.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The first element 'id' is a group name or a CBOR array of group names, which is associated with groups for which the next four elements apply. Each specified group name is a CBOR text string and is hereafter referred to as 'gname'.</li>
            <li>The second element 'sign_alg' is a CBOR integer or a text string that indicates the signature algorithm used in the groups identified by the 'gname' values. It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles to define specific values that this parameter can take (<xref target="req3" format="none">REQ3</xref>), which are selected from the set of signing algorithms of the "COSE Algorithms" registry <xref target="COSE.Algorithms"/>.</li>
            <li>The third element 'sign_parameters' is a CBOR array that indicates the parameters of the signature algorithm used in the groups identified by the 'gname' values. Its content depends on the value of 'sign_alg'. It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles to define the possible values and structure for the elements of this parameter (<xref target="req4" format="none">REQ4</xref>).</li>
            <li>The fourth element 'sign_key_parameters' is a CBOR array that indicates the parameters of the key used with the signature algorithm in the groups identified by the 'gname' values. Its content depends on the value of 'sign_alg'. It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles to define the possible values and structure for the elements of this parameter (<xref target="req5" format="none">REQ5</xref>).</li>
            <li>The fifth element 'cred_fmt' either is a CBOR integer indicating the format of authentication credentials used in the groups identified by the 'gname' values or is the CBOR simple value <tt>null</tt> (0xf6), which indicates that the KDC does not act as a repository of authentication credentials for group members. Its acceptable integer values are taken from the "Label" column of the "COSE Header Parameters" registry <xref target="COSE.Header.Parameters"/>, with some of those values also indicating the type of container to use for exchanging the authentication credentials with the KDC (e.g., a chain or bag of certificates). It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles to define specific values to use for this parameter, consistently with the acceptable formats of authentication credentials (<xref target="req6" format="none">REQ6</xref>).</li>
          </ul>
          <t>The CDDL notation <xref target="RFC8610"/> of the 'sign_info' parameter is given below.</t>

      <t>In particular, this section defines the interface available at the KDC, specifies the handlers of each resource provided by the KDC interface, and describes how Clients interact with those resources to join a group and to perform additional operations as group members.</t>
      <t>A key operation that the Client can perform after transferring the access token to the KDC is a Join Request-Response exchange with the KDC. In the Join Request, the Client specifies the group it requests to join (see <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>). The KDC will then check the stored access token associated with the Client and verify that the Client is accordingly authorized to join the specified group. In case of successful verification, the KDC provides the Client with the keying material to securely communicate with the other members of the group.</t>
      <t>Later on as a group member, the Client can also rely on the interface at the KDC to perform additional operations consistent with the roles it has in the group.</t>

        <section anchor="gid-post">
          <name>POST Handler</name>
          <t>The POST handler processes the Join Request sent by a Client to join a group and returns a Join Response as a successful result of the joining process (see <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>). At a high level, the POST handler adds the Client to the list of current group members, adds the authentication credential of the Client to the list of the group members' authentication credentials, and returns the symmetric group keying material for the group identified by GROUPNAME.</t>
          <t>The handler expects a request with payload formatted as a CBOR map, which <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain the following fields, which, if included, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the format and value as specified below.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>'scope': its value specifies the name of the group that the Client is attempting to join and the roles that the client wishes to have in the group. This value is encoded as a CBOR byte string wrapping one scope entry, as defined in <xref target="ssec-authorization-request"/>.</li>
            <li>
              <t>'get_creds': it is included if the Client wishes to receive the authentication credentials of the current group members from the KDC. This parameter may be included in the Join Request if the KDC stores the authentication credentials of the group members, while it is not useful to include it if the Client obtains those authentication credentials through alternative means, e.g., from the AS. Note that including this parameter might result in a following Join Response of a large size, which can be inconvenient for resource-constrained devices.  </t>
              <t>
If the Client wishes to retrieve the authentication credentials of all the current group members, the 'get_creds' parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> encode the CBOR simple value <tt>null</tt> (0xf6). Otherwise, if the Client wishes to retrieve the authentication credentials of nodes with specific roles, the 'get_creds' parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> encode a non-empty CBOR array containing the three elements 'inclusion_flag', 'role_filter', and 'id_filter', as defined below.  </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>The first element, namely 'inclusion_flag', encodes the CBOR simple value <tt>true</tt> (0xf5) if the Client wishes to receive the authentication credentials of the nodes having their node identifier specified in 'id_filter' (i.e., selection by inclusive filtering). Instead, this element encodes the CBOR simple value <tt>false</tt> (0xf4) if the Client wishes to receive the authentication credentials of the nodes that do not have the node identifiers specified in the third element 'id_filter' (i.e., selection by exclusive filtering). In the Join Request, this parameter encodes the CBOR simple value <tt>true</tt> (0xf5).</li>
                <li>
                  <t>The second element, namely 'role_filter', is a CBOR array. Each element of the array contains one role or a combination of roles for the group identified by GROUPNAME. This parameter indicates that the Client wishes to receive the authentication credentials of all the group members having any of the specified roles or combination of roles (i.e., having any of those single roles or at least all the roles indicated in any of those combinations of roles).      </t>
                  <t>
For example, the array ["role1", "role2+role3"] indicates that the Client wishes to receive the authentication credentials of all group members that have at least "role1" or at least both "role2" and "role3". In the Join Request, this parameter is a non-empty array.</t>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <t>The third element, namely 'id_filter', is a CBOR array. Each element of the array contains a node identifier of a group member for the group identified by GROUPNAME. This parameter indicates that the Client wishes to receive the authentication credentials of the nodes that have or do not have the specified node identifiers based on the value of 'inclusion_flag' (i.e., as a selection by inclusive or exclusive filtering). In the Join Request, the Client does not filter authentication credentials based on node identifiers, so this parameter is an empty array.      </t>
                  <t>
In fact, when first joining the group, the Client is not expected or capable to express a filter based on node identifiers of other group members. Instead, when already a group member and sending a Join Request to rejoin, the Client is not expected to include the 'get_creds' parameter in the Join Request altogether, since it can rather retrieve authentication credentials associated with specific group identifiers as defined in <xref target="sec-key-retrieval"/>.</t>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <t>
The CDDL definition <xref target="RFC8610"/> of 'get_creds' is given in <xref target="cddl-ex-getpubkeys"/>; as an example, it uses node identifiers encoded as CBOR byte strings, role identifiers encoded as CBOR text strings, and combinations of roles encoded as CBOR arrays of role identifiers.  </t>
              <t>
Note that, for this handler, 'inclusion_flag' is always set to true and the array of roles 'role_filter' is always non-empty, while the array of node identifiers 'id_filter' is always empty. However, this is not necessarily the case for other handlers using the 'get_creds' parameter.</t>

        </li>
            <li>'client_cred': encoded as a CBOR byte string, whose value is the original binary representation of the Client's authentication credential. This parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present if the KDC is managing (collecting from and distributing to Clients) the authentication credentials of the group members and the Client's role in the group will require the Client to send messages to one or more group members. It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles to define the specific formats that are acceptable to use for authentication credentials in the group (<xref target="req6" format="none">REQ6</xref>).</li>
            <li>'cnonce': encoded as a CBOR byte string, whose value is a dedicated nonce N_C generated by the Client. This parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present.</li>
            <li>
              <t>'client_cred_verify': encoded as a CBOR byte string. This parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present if the 'client_cred' parameter is present and no authentication credential associated with the Client's access token can be retrieved for that group.  </t>
              <t>
The value of the CBOR byte string is the proof-of-possession (PoP) evidence computed by the Client over the following PoP input: the scope (encoded as a CBOR byte string) concatenated with N_S (encoded as a CBOR byte string) concatenated with N_C (encoded as a CBOR byte string), where:  </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>scope is either specified in the 'scope' parameter above, if present, or a default scope entry that the handler is expected to know otherwise;</li>
                <li>N_S is the challenge received from the KDC in the 'kdcchallenge' parameter of the 2.01 (Created) response to the Token Transfer Request (see <xref target="token-post"/>), encoded as a CBOR byte string; and</li>
                <li>N_C is the nonce generated by the Client and specified in the 'cnonce' parameter above, encoded as a CBOR byte string.</li>
              </ul>
              <t>
An example of PoP input to compute 'client_cred_verify' using CBOR encoding is given in <xref target="fig-client-cred-input"/>.  </t>
              <t>
A possible type of PoP evidence is a signature that the Client computes by using its own private key, whose corresponding public key is specified in the authentication credential carried in the 'client_cred' parameter. Application profiles of this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify the exact approaches used to compute the PoP evidence to include in 'client_cred_verify' and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify which of those approaches is used in which case (<xref target="req14" format="none">REQ14</xref>).  </t>
              <t>
If the access token was not provided to the KDC through a Token Transfer Request (e.g., the access token is instead transferred during the establishment of a secure communication association), it is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> of the specific application profile to define how the challenge N_S is generated (<xref target="req15" format="none">REQ15</xref>).</t>
            </li>
            <li>'creds_repo': it can be present if the format of the Client's authentication credential conveyed in the 'client_cred' parameter is a certificate. In such a case, this parameter has as its value the URI of the certificate. This parameter is encoded as a CBOR text string. Alternative specific encodings of this parameter <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be defined in application profiles of this specification (<xref target="opt6" format="none">OPT6</xref>).</li>
            <li>
              <t>'control_uri': its value is a full URI, encoded as a CBOR text string. A default url-path is /ace-group/GROUPNAME/node, although implementations can use different ones instead. The URI <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have url-path /ace-group/GROUPNAME.  </t>

If 'control_uri' is specified in the Join Request, the Client acts as a CoAP server and hosts a resource at this specific URI. The KDC <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use this URI to send CoAP requests to the Client (acting as a CoAP server in this exchange), for example, for one-to-one provisioning of new group keying material when performing a group rekeying (see <xref target="point-to-point-rekeying"/>) or to inform the Client of its removal from the group (see <xref target="sec-node-removal"/>).  </t>
              <t>
In particular, this resource is intended for communications exclusively concerning the group identified by GROUPNAME and whose group name is specified in the 'scope' parameter of the Join Request, if present therein. If the KDC does not implement mechanisms using this resource for that group, it can ignore this parameter. Other additional functionalities of this resource <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be defined in application profiles of this specifications (<xref target="opt7" format="none">OPT7</xref>).</t>

          <t>If the request does not include the 'scope'  parameter, the KDC is expected to understand what roles the Client is requesting to join the group with. For example, as per the access token, the Client might have been granted access to the group with only one role. If the KDC cannot determine which exact roles should be considered for the Client, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response.</t>
          <t>The handler considers the scope specified in the access token associated with the Client and checks the scope entry related to the group identified by the GROUPNAME associated with the endpoint. In particular, the handler checks whether the set of roles specified in that scope entry includes all the roles that the Client wishes to have in the group as per the Join Request. If this is not the case, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.03 (Forbidden) error response.</t>
          <t>If the KDC manages the group members' authentication credentials, the handler checks if one is included in the 'client_cred' parameter. If so, the KDC retrieves the authentication credential and performs the following actions.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>If the access token was provided through a Token Transfer Request (see <xref target="token-post"/>) but the KDC cannot retrieve the 'kdcchallenge' associated with this Client (see <xref target="token-post"/>), the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also have Content-Format "application/ace-groupcomm+cbor". The payload of the error response is a CBOR map including a newly generated 'kdcchallenge' value, which is specified in the 'kdcchallenge' parameter. The KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> store the newly generated value as the 'kdcchallenge' value associated with this Client, replacing the currently stored value (if any).</li>
            <li>
              <t>The KDC checks the authentication credential to be valid for the group identified by GROUPNAME. That is, it checks that the authentication credential has the format used in the group, is intended for the public key algorithm used in the group, and is aligned with the possible associated parameters used in the group.  </t>
              <t>
If this verification fails, the handler <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 2 ("Authentication credential incompatible with the group configuration").</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The KDC verifies the PoP evidence conveyed in the 'client_cred_verify' parameter. Application profiles of this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify the exact approaches used to verify the PoP evidence and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify which of those approaches is used in which case (<xref target="req14" format="none">REQ14</xref>).  </t>
              <t>
If the PoP evidence does not pass verification, the handler <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format  "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 3 ("Invalid proof-of-possession evidence").</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>If no authentication credential is conveyed in the 'client_cred' parameter, the handler checks if the KDC currently stores an authentication credential that is associated with the access token and with the group identified by GROUPNAME (see also <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>). Note that the same joining node may use different authentication credentials in different groups, and all those authentication credentials would be associated with the same access token.</t>
          <t>If an eligible authentication credential for the Client is neither present in the 'client_cred' parameter nor retrieved from the stored ones at the KDC, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the handler stops the processing and replies with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response. Application profiles <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> define alternatives (<xref target="opt8" format="none">OPT8</xref>).</t>
          <t>If, regardless of the reason, the KDC replies with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response, the payload of the response <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be a CBOR map. For instance, the CBOR map can include a 'sign_info' parameter formatted as 'sign_info_resp' defined in <xref target="sign-info"/>, with the 'cred_fmt' element set to the CBOR simple value <tt>null</tt> (0xf6) if the Client sent its own authentication credential and the KDC is not set to store authentication credentials of the group members. When the response payload is a CBOR map including such parameters, the error response has Content-Format "application/ace-groupcomm+cbor".</t>
          <t>If all the verifications above succeed, the KDC proceeds as follows.</t>
          <t>First, only in case the Client is not already a group member, the handler performs the following actions:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The handler adds the Client to the list of current members of the group.</li>
            <li>The handler assigns a name NODENAME to the Client and creates a sub-resource to /ace-group/GROUPNAME at the KDC, i.e., /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME.</li>
            <li>The handler associates the node identifier NODENAME with the access token and the secure communication association for the Client.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>Then, the handler performs the following actions.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>If the KDC manages the group members' authentication credentials:  </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>The handler associates the retrieved Client's authentication credential with the tuple composed of the node name NODENAME, the group name GROUPNAME, and the access token.</li>
                <li>The handler adds the retrieved Client's authentication credential to the list of authentication credentials stored for the group identified by GROUPNAME. If such a list already includes an authentication credential for the Client, but a different authentication credential is specified in the 'client_cred' parameter, then the handler <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> replace the old authentication credential in the list with the one specified in the 'client_cred' parameter.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If backward security is prescribed by application policies installed at the KDC or by the used application profile of this specification, then the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate new group keying material and securely distribute it to the current group members (see <xref target="sec-group-rekeying"/>).</li>
            <li>The handler returns a successful Join Response, as defined below, which contains the symmetric group keying material, the group policies, and the authentication credentials of the current members of the group if the KDC manages those and the Client requested those.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>The Join Response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have response code 2.01 (Created) if the Client has been added to the list of group members in this join exchange (see above) or 2.04 (Changed) otherwise, i.e., if the Client is rejoining the group without having left it.</t>
          <t>The Join Response message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the Location-Path CoAP Options, specifying the path to the sub-resource associated with the Client, i.e., /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME.</t>
          <t>The Join Response message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/ace-groupcomm+cbor". The payload of the response is formatted as a CBOR map, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the following fields with the values specified below:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>'gkty': identifying the key type of the keying material specified in the 'key' parameter. This parameter is encoded as a CBOR integer or a CBOR text string. Possible values are taken from the "Key Type Value" column of the "ACE Groupcomm Key Types" registry defined in <xref target="iana-key"/> of this specification. Implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the key type specified by this parameter matches the application profile being used and, if applicable, that such an application profile is listed in the "Profile" column of the "ACE Groupcomm Key Types" registry for the key type in question.</li>
            <li>'key': containing the keying material used for securing the group communication or information required to derive such keying material.</li>
            <li>'num': containing the current version number of the group keying material, encoded as a CBOR integer.

          <t>The Join Response <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> contain the following fields with the values specified below:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>'exp': its value specifies the expiration time of the group keying material specified in the 'key' parameter, encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer. The value is the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time, ignoring leap seconds, analogous to what is specified for NumericDate in <xref section="2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7519"/>. After the time indicated in this parameter, group members <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the group keying material specified in the 'key' parameter. The group members can retrieve the latest group keying material from the KDC.</li>
            <li>'exi': its value specifies the residual lifetime of the group keying material, encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer. If the 'exp' parameter is included, this parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be included. The value represents the residual lifetime of the group keying material specified in the 'key' parameter, i.e., it is the number of seconds between the current time at the KDC and the time when the keying material expires (as specified in the 'exp' parameter, if present). A Client determines the expiration time of the keying material by adding the seconds specified in the 'exi' parameter to its current time upon receiving the Join Response containing the 'exi' parameter. After such an expiration time, the Client <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the group keying material specified in the 'key' parameter. The Client can retrieve the latest group keying material from the KDC.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>If a Client has a reliable way to synchronize its internal clock with UTC, and both the 'exp' and 'exi' parameters are present, then the Client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the 'exp' parameter value as expiration time for the group keying material. Otherwise, the Client uses the 'exi' parameter value to determine the expiration time as defined above.</t>
          <t>When a Client relies on the 'exi' parameter, the expiration time that it computes is offset in the future with respect to the actual expiration time as intended by the KDC and specified in the 'exp' parameter (if present). Such an offset is the amount of time between when the KDC sends the response message including the 'exi' parameter and when the Client receives that message. That is, especially if the delivery of the response to the Client is delayed, the Client will believe the keying material to be valid for a longer time than the KDC actually means. However, before approaching the actual expiration time, the KDC is expected to rekey the group and distribute new keying material (see <xref target="sec-group-rekeying"/>).</t>
          <t>Optionally, the Join Response <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain the following parameters, which, if included, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the format and value as specified below.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li><t>'ace_groupcomm_profile': its value is encoded as a CBOR integer and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used to uniquely identify the application profile for group communication.

            <li>'creds': it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present if 'get_creds' was present in the Join Request; otherwise, it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be present. Its value is encoded as a CBOR array specifying the authentication credentials of the group members, i.e., of all of them or of the ones selected according to the 'get_creds' parameter in the Join Request. In particular, each element of the array is a CBOR byte string, whose value is the original binary representation of a group member's authentication credential. It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles to define the specific formats of authentication credentials that are acceptable to use in the group (<xref target="req6" format="none">REQ6</xref>).</li>
            <li>
              <t>'peer_roles': it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be present if 'creds' is also present; otherwise, it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be present. Its value is encoded as a CBOR array of n elements, where n is the number of authentication credentials included in the 'creds' parameter (at most, the number of members in the group). The i-th element of the array specifies the role(s) that the group member associated with the i-th authentication credential in 'creds' has in the group. In particular, each array element is encoded like the role element of a scope entry, which is consistent with the used format (see <xref target="ssec-authorization-request"/>).  </t>
              <t>
This parameter <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be omitted if the Client can rely on other means to unambiguously gain knowledge of the role of each group member whose associated authentication credential is specified in the 'creds' parameter. For example, all such group members may have the same role in the group joined by the Client, and such a role can be unambiguously assumed by the Client (e.g., based on what is defined in the used application profile of this specification). As another example, each of the authentication credentials specified in the 'creds' parameter can indicate the role(s) that the corresponding group member has in the group joined by the Client.  </t>
              <t>
When receiving the authentication credential of a Client in the 'client_cred' parameter of a Join Request (see <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>) or of an Authentication Credential Update Request (see <xref target="update-pub-key"/>), the KDC is not expected to check that the authentication credential indicates the role(s) that the Client can have or has in the group in question. When preparing a Join Response, the KDC can decide whether to include the 'peer_roles' parameter, depending on the specific set of authentication credentials specified in the 'creds' parameter of that Join Response.</t>
            </li>
            <li>'peer_identifiers': it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present if 'creds' is also present; otherwise, it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be present. Its value is encoded as a CBOR array of n elements, where n is the number of authentication credentials included in the 'creds' parameter (at most, the number of members in the group). The i-th element of the array specifies the node identifier that the group member associated with the i-th authentication credential in 'creds' has in the group. In particular, the i-th array element is encoded as a CBOR byte string, whose value is the node identifier of the group member. The specific format of node identifiers of group members is specified by the application profile (<xref target="req25" format="none">REQ25</xref>).</li>
            <li><t>'group_policies': its value is encoded as a CBOR map, whose elements specify how the group handles specific management aspects. These include, for instance, approaches to achieve synchronization of sequence numbers among group members. The possible elements of the CBOR map are registered in the "ACE Groupcomm Policies" registry defined in <xref target="ace-groupcomm-policies"/> of this specification. This specification defines the three elements "Sequence Number Synchronization Methods", "Key Update Check Interval", and "Expiration Delta", which are summarized in <xref target="fig-ACE-Groupcomm-Policies"/>.

              <t>'mgt_key_material': encoded as a CBOR byte string and containing the specific administrative keying material that the joining node requires in order to participate in the group rekeying process performed by the KDC. This parameter <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be present if the 'rekeying_scheme' parameter is not present and the application profile does not specify a default group rekeying scheme to use in the group. Some simple rekeying schemes may not require specific administrative keying material to be provided, e.g., the basic "Point-to-Point" group rekeying scheme (see <xref target="point-to-point-rekeying"/>).  </t>
              <t>
In more advanced group rekeying schemes, the administrative keying material can be composed of multiple keys organized, for instance, into a logical tree hierarchy, whose root key is the only administrative key shared by all the group members. In such a case, each group member is exclusively associated with one leaf key in the hierarchy and stores only the administrative keys from the associated leaf key all the way up along the path to the root key. That is, different group members can be provided with a different subset of the overall administrative keying material.  </t>
              <t>
		It is expected from separate documents to define how the advanced group rekeying scheme, possibly indicated in the 'rekeying_scheme' parameter, is used by an application profile of this specification. This includes defining the format of the administrative keying material to specify in 'mgt_key_material' consistently with the group rekeying scheme and the application profile in question.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>'control_group_uri': its value is a full URI, encoded as a CBOR text string. The URI <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify addressing information intended to reach all the members in the group. For example, this can be a multicast IP address, optionally together with a port number that, if omitted, defaults to 5683, i.e., the default port number for the "coap" URI scheme (see <xref section="6.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7252"/>). The URI <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include GROUPNAME in the url-path. A default url-path is /ace-group/GROUPNAME, although implementations can use different ones instead. The URI <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have url-path /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes.  </t>
              <t>
If 'control_group_uri' is included in the Join Response, the Clients supporting this parameter act as CoAP servers, host a resource at this specific URI, and listen to the specified addressing information.  </t>
              <t>
The KDC <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use this URI to send one-to-many CoAP requests to the Client group members (acting as CoAP servers in this exchange), for example, for one-to-many provisioning of new group keying material when performing a group rekeying (see <xref target="one-to-many-rekeying"/>) or to inform the Clients of their removal from the group (see <xref target="sec-node-removal"/>).  </t>
              <t>
In particular, this resource is intended for communications exclusively concerning the group identified by GROUPNAME and whose group name was specified in the 'scope' parameter of the Join Request, if present. If the KDC does not implement mechanisms using this resource for that group, it can ignore this parameter. Other additional functionalities of this resource <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be defined in application profiles of this specifications (<xref target="opt10" format="none">OPT10</xref>).</t>

If, as a group member, the Client later sends a GET request to the /ace-group/GROUPNAME/kdc-cred resource for retrieving the latest KDC's authentication credential (see <xref target="kdc-pub-key-get"/>), then the KDC uses the stored 'clientchallenge' for computing the PoP evidence to include in the response sent to the Client, hence proving the possession of its own private key.</t>

            <t>If not previously established, the Client and the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> first establish a pairwise secure communication association (<xref target="req24" format="none">REQ24</xref>). This can be achieved, for instance, by using a transport profile of ACE. The join exchange <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> occur over that secure communication association. The Client and the KDC <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use that same secure communication association to protect further pairwise communications that must be protected.</t>
            <t>It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> that the secure communication association between the Client and the KDC is established by using the proof-of-possession key bound to the access token. As a result, the proof of possession to bind the access token to the Client is performed by using the proof-of-possession key bound to the access token for establishing the pairwise secure communication association between the Client and the KDC.</t>
            <t>To join the group, the Client sends a CoAP POST request to the /ace-group/GROUPNAME endpoint at the KDC, where the group to join is identified by GROUPNAME. The group name is specified in the scope entry conveyed by the 'scope' parameter of the request (if present), formatted as specified in <xref target="gid-post"/>. This group name is the same as in the scope entry corresponding to that group, specified in the 'scope' parameter of the Authorization Request/Response, or it can be determined from it. Note that, in case of successful joining, the Location-Path Options in the Join Response provide the Client with the path of the URI to use for retrieving individual keying material and for leaving the group.</t>
            <t>If the node is joining a group for the first time and the KDC maintains the authentication credentials of the group members, the Client is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> to send its own authentication credential and proof-of-possession (PoP) evidence in the Join Request (see the 'client_cred' and 'client_cred_verify' parameters in <xref target="gid-post"/>). The request is accepted only if both the authentication credential is provided and the PoP evidence is successfully verified.</t>
            <t>If a node rejoins a group as authorized by the same access token and using the same authentication credential, it can omit the authentication credential and the PoP evidence, or just the PoP evidence, from the Join Request. Then, the KDC will be able to retrieve the node's authentication credential associated with the access token for that group. If the authentication credential has been discarded, the KDC replies with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response, as specified in <xref target="gid-post"/>. If a node rejoins a group but wants to update its own authentication credential, it needs to include both its authentication credential and the PoP evidence in the Join Request, like when it joined the group for the first time.</t>

        <t>This resource implements the GET, POST, and DELETE handlers.</t>
        <t>In addition to what is defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>, each of the handlers performs the following two verifications.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The handler verifies that the Client is a current member of the group. If the verification fails, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.03 (Forbidden) error response.

          <li>The handler verifies that the node name of the Client is equal to NODENAME used in the url-path. If the verification fails, the handler replies with a 4.03 (Forbidden) error response.</li>
        </ul>
        <section anchor="node-get">
          <name>GET Handler</name>
          <t>The handler expects a GET request.</t>
          <t>If all verifications succeed, the handler replies with a 2.05 (Content) response containing both the group keying material and the individual keying material for the Client or information enabling the Client to derive it.</t>
          <t>The payload of the response is formatted as a CBOR map, which includes the same fields of the response defined in <xref target="gid-get"/>. In particular, the format for the group keying material is the same as defined in the response of <xref target="gid-get"/>. If the 'exp' parameter is included, the 'exi' parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be included. If the parameter 'exi' is included, its value specifies the residual lifetime of the group keying material from the current time at the KDC.</t>
          <t>The CBOR map can include additional parameters that specify the individual keying material for the Client. The specific format of individual keying material for group members or of the information to derive such keying material <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be defined in application profiles of this specification (<xref target="req27" format="none">REQ27</xref>), together with the corresponding CBOR map key that has to be registered in the "ACE Groupcomm Parameters" registry defined in <xref target="iana-reg"/>.</t>
          <t>Optionally, the KDC can make the sub-resource at /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME also observable <xref target="RFC7641"/> for the associated node. In case the KDC removes that node from the group without having been explicitly asked for it, this allows the KDC to send an unsolicited 4.04 (Not Found) response to the node as a notification of eviction from the group (see <xref target="sec-node-removal"/>).</t>
          <t>Note that the node could have also been observing the resource at /ace-group/GROUPNAME in order to be informed of changes in the group keying material. In such a case, this method would result in largely overlapping notifications received for the resource at /ace-group/GROUPNAME and the sub-resource at /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME.</t>
          <t>In order to mitigate this, a node that supports the CoAP No-Response Option <xref target="RFC7967"/> can use it when starting the observation of the sub-resource at /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME. In particular, the GET observation request can also include the No-Response option, with value set to 2 (Not interested in 2.xx responses).</t>
          <section anchor="update-keys">
            <name>Retrieve Group and Individual Keying Material</name>
            <t>When any of the following happens, a node <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> stop using the stored group keying material to protect outgoing messages and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> stop using it to decrypt and verify incoming messages.</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>Upon expiration of the keying material, according to what is indicated by the KDC through the 'exp' and/or 'exi' parameter (e.g., in a Join Response) or to a pre-configured value.</li>
              <li>Upon receiving a notification of revoked/renewed keying material from the KDC, possibly as part of an update of the keying material (rekeying) triggered by the KDC.</li>
              <li>Upon receiving messages from other group members without being able to retrieve the keying material to correctly decrypt them. This may be due to rekeying messages previously sent by the KDC that the Client was not able to receive or decrypt.</li>
            </ul>
            <t>In either case, if it wants to continue participating in the group communication, the Client has to request the latest keying material from the KDC. To this end, the Client sends a CoAP GET request to the /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME endpoint at the KDC, formatted as specified in <xref target="node-get"/>. The Client can request the latest keying material from the KDC before the currently stored, old keying material reaches its expiration time.</t>
            <t>Note that policies can be set up so that the Client sends a Key Distribution Request to the KDC only after a given number of received messages could not be decrypted (because of failed decryption processing or the inability to retrieve the necessary keying material).</t>
            <t>It is application dependent and pertaining to the used secure message exchange (e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm"/>) to set up these policies for instructing Clients to retain incoming messages and for how long (<xref target="opt11" format="none">OPT11</xref>). This allows Clients to possibly decrypt such messages after getting updated keying material, rather than just consider them invalid messages to discard right away.</t>
            <t>After having failed to decrypt messages from another group member and having sent a Key Distribution Request to the KDC, the Client might end up retrieving the same, latest group keying material that it already stores. In such a case, multiple failed decryptions might be due to the message sender and/or the KDC that have changed their authentication credential. Hence, the Client can retrieve such latest authentication credentials by sending to the KDC an Authentication Credential Request (see Sections <xref target="sec-key-retrieval" format="counter"/> and <xref target="sec-key-retrieval-all" format="counter"/>) and a KDC Authentication Credential Request (see <xref target="kdc-pub-key"/>), respectively.</t>
            <t>The Client can also send to the KDC a Key Distribution Request without having been triggered by a failed decryption of a message from another group member, if the Client wants to be sure that it currently stores the latest group keying material. If that is the case, the Client will receive from the KDC the same group keying material it already stores.</t>

          <name>POST Handler</name>
          <t>The POST handler processes requests from a Client that asks for new individual keying material, as required to process messages exchanged in the group.</t>
          <t>The handler expects a POST request with an empty payload.</t>
          <t>In addition to what is defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/> and at the beginning of <xref target="node-subresource"/>, the handler verifies that this operation is consistent with the set of roles that the Client has in the group (<xref target="req11" format="none">REQ11</xref>). If the verification fails, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 1 ("Request inconsistent with the current roles").</t>
          <t>If the KDC is currently not able to serve this request, i.e., to generate new individual keying material for the requesting Client, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 5.03 (Service unavailable) error response. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 4 ("No available individual keying material").</t>
          <t>If all verifications succeed, the handler replies with a 2.04 (Changed) response containing newly generated individual keying material for the Client. The payload of the response is formatted as a CBOR map. The specific format of newly generated individual keying material for group members or of the information to derive such keying material <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be defined in application profiles of this specification (<xref target="req27" format="none">REQ27</xref>), together with the corresponding CBOR map key that has to be registered in the "ACE Groupcomm Parameters" registry defined in <xref target="iana-reg"/>.</t>
          <t>The typical successful outcome consists in replying with newly generated individual keying material for the Client, as defined above. However, application profiles of this specification <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also extend this handler in order to achieve different akin outcomes (<xref target="opt12" format="none">OPT12</xref>), for instance:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Not providing the Client with newly generated individual keying material, but rather rekeying the whole group, i.e., providing all the current group members with newly generated group keying material.</li>
            <li>Both providing the Client with newly generated individual keying material, as well as rekeying the whole group, i.e., providing all the current group members with newly generated group keying material.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>In either case, the handler may specify the new group keying material as part of the 2.04 (Changed) response.</t>
          <t>Note that this handler is not intended to accommodate requests from a group member to trigger a group rekeying, whose scheduling and execution is an exclusive prerogative of the KDC (also see related security considerations in <xref target="sec-cons-rekeying"/>).</t>
          <section anchor="new-keys">
            <name>Request to Change Individual Keying Material</name>
            <t>A Client may ask the KDC for new individual keying material. For instance, this can be due to the expiration of such individual keying material or to the exhaustion of Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) nonces if an AEAD encryption algorithm is used for protecting communications in the group. An example of individual keying material can simply be an individual encryption key associated with the Client. Hence, the Client may ask for a new individual encryption key or for new input material to derive it.</t>
            <t>To this end, the Client performs a Key Renewal Request-Response exchange with the KDC, i.e., it sends a CoAP POST request to the /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME endpoint at the KDC, which is formatted as defined in  <xref target="node-get"/>, where GROUPNAME identifies the group and NODENAME is the node name of the Client.</t>

          <t>In addition to what is defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>, the handler verifies that the Client is a current member of the group.

          <t>The handler expects a POST request with the payload as specified in <xref target="gid-post"/>, with the difference that the payload includes only the parameters 'client_cred', 'cnonce', and 'client_cred_verify'.</t>
          <t>The PoP evidence included in the 'client_cred_verify' parameter is computed in the same way considered in <xref target="gid-post"/> and defined by the specific application profile (<xref target="req14" format="none">REQ14</xref>) by using the following to build the PoP input: i) the same scope entry specified by the Client in the 'scope' parameter of the latest Join Request that the Client sent to the KDC in order to join the group identified by GROUPNAME; ii) the latest N_S value stored by the Client; and iii) a new N_C nonce generated by the Client and specified in the parameter 'cnonce' of this request.</t>
          <t>An example of PoP input to compute 'client_cred_verify' using CBOR encoding is given in <xref target="fig-client-cred-input-2"/>.</t>
          <t>It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> for application profiles to define the specific formats of authentication credentials that are acceptable to use in the group (<xref target="req6" format="none">REQ6</xref>).</t>
          <t>In addition to what is defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/> and at the beginning of <xref target="node-subresource"/>, the handler verifies that this operation is consistent with the set of roles that the node has in the group. If the verification fails, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 1 ("Request inconsistent with the current roles").</t>
          <t>If the KDC cannot retrieve the 'kdcchallenge' associated with this Client (see <xref target="token-post"/>), the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also have Content-Format "application/ace-groupcomm+cbor". The payload of the error response is a CBOR map including the 'kdcchallenge' parameter, which specifies a newly generated 'kdcchallenge' value. In such a case, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> store the newly generated value as the 'kdcchallenge' value associated with this Client, replacing the currently stored value (if any).</t>
          <t>Otherwise, the handler checks that the authentication credential specified in the 'client_cred' field is valid for the group identified by GROUPNAME. That is, the handler checks that the authentication credential is encoded according to the format used in the group, is intended for the public key algorithm used in the group, and is aligned with the possible associated parameters used in the group. If that cannot be successfully verified, the handler <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format  "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 2 ("Authentication credential incompatible with the group configuration").</t>
          <t>Otherwise, the handler verifies the PoP evidence conveyed in the 'client_cred_verify' parameter of the request, by using the authentication credential specified in the 'client_cred' parameter as well as the same way considered in <xref target="gid-post"/> and defined by the specific application profile (<xref target="req14" format="none">REQ14</xref>). If the PoP evidence does not pass verification, the handler <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error response. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>.

          <t>If all verifications succeed, the handler performs the following actions.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The handler associates the authentication credential from the 'client_cred' parameter of the request with the node identifier NODENAME, as well as with the access token associated with the node identified by NODENAME.</li>

      <name>Removal of a Group Member</name>
      <t>A Client identified by NODENAME may be removed from a group identified by GROUPNAME where it is a member, for example, due to the following reasons.</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	<li>The Client explicitly asks to leave the group, as defined in <xref target="ssec-group-leaving"/>.</li>
        <li>The node has been found compromised or is suspected so. The KDC is expected to determine that a group member has to be evicted either through its own means or based on information that it obtains from a trusted source (e.g., an Intrusion Detection System or an issuer of authentication credentials). Additional mechanics, protocols, and interfaces at the KDC that can support this are out of the scope of this document.</li>
        <li>The Client's authorization to be a group member with the current roles is not valid anymore, i.e., the access token has expired or has been revoked. If the AS provides token introspection (see <xref section="5.9" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>), the KDC can optionally use it and check whether the Client is still authorized.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>In all cases, the KDC performs the following actions.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The KDC removes the Client from the list of current members of the group. When doing so, the KDC deletes the currently stored value of 'clientchallenge' for that Client, which was specified in the latest Join Request that the Client sent to the KDC in order to join the group (see <xref target="gid-post"/>).</li>
        <li>In case of forced eviction, i.e., for cases 2 and 3 above, the KDC deletes the authentication credential of the removed Client if it acts as a repository of authentication credentials for group members.</li>
        <li>If the removed Client is registered as an observer of the group-membership resource at /ace-group/GROUPNAME, the KDC removes the Client from the list of observers of that resource.</li>
        <li>
          <t>If the sub-resource /nodes/NODENAME was created for the removed Client, the KDC deletes that sub-resource.  </t>
          <t>
In case of forced eviction, i.e., for cases 2 and 3 above, the KDC <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> explicitly inform the removed Client by means of the following methods.  </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>If the evicted Client implements the 'control_uri' resource (see <xref target="gid-post"/>), the KDC sends a DELETE request to that resource, targeting the URI specified in the 'control_uri' parameter of the Join Request (see <xref target="gid-post"/>).</li>
            <li>
              <t>If the evicted Client is observing its associated sub-resource at /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME (see <xref target="node-get"/>), the KDC sends an unsolicited 4.04 (Not Found) error response, which does not include the Observe Option and indicates that the observed resource has been deleted (see <xref section="3.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7641"/>).      </t>
              <t>
The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 5 ("Group membership terminated").</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If forward security is prescribed by application policies installed at the KDC or by the used application profile of this specification, then the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate new group keying material and securely distribute it to all the current group members except the leaving node (see <xref target="sec-group-rekeying"/>).</li>
      </ul>

    <section anchor="sec-group-rekeying">
      <name>Group Rekeying Process</name>
      <t>A group rekeying is started and driven by the KDC. The KDC is not intended to accommodate explicit requests from group members to trigger a group rekeying. That is, the scheduling and execution of a group rekeying is an exclusive prerogative of the KDC.
      Some reasons that can trigger a group rekeying include a change in the group membership, the current group keying material approaching its expiration time, or a regularly scheduled update of the group keying material.</t>
      <t>The KDC can perform a group rekeying before the current group keying material expires, unless it is acceptable or there are reasons to temporarily pause secure communications in the group, following the expiration of the current keying material. For example, a pause in the group communication might have been scheduled to start anyway when the group keying material expires, e.g., to allow maintenance operations on the group members. As another example, the KDC might be carrying out a verification that some group members are seemingly compromised and to be evicted, and this needs to be completed in order to appropriately define and schedule the exact rekeying process to perform. As a result, the KDC could delay the execution of the group rekeying.</t>
      <t>The KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> increment the version number NUM of the current keying material before distributing the newly generated keying material with version number NUM+1 to the group. Once the group rekeying is completed, the KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> delete the old keying material and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> store the newly distributed keying material in persistent storage.</t>
      <t>Distributing the new group keying material requires the KDC to send multiple rekeying messages to the group members. Depending on the rekeying scheme used in the group and the reason that has triggered the rekeying process, each rekeying message can be intended for one or multiple group members, hereafter referred to as target group members. The KDC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support at least the "Point-to-Point" group rekeying scheme described in <xref target="point-to-point-rekeying"/> and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> support additional ones.</t>
      <t>Each rekeying message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format  "application/ace-groupcomm+cbor" and its payload is formatted as a CBOR map, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include at least the information specified in the Key Distribution Response message (see <xref target="gid-get"/>), i.e., the parameters 'gkty', 'key', and 'num' defined in <xref target="gid-post"/>. The CBOR map <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also include the parameters 'exp' and 'exi'. If the 'exp' parameter is included, the 'exi' parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be included. The CBOR map <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include the parameter 'mgt_key_material' to specify new administrative keying material for the target group members if it is relevant for the used rekeying scheme.</t>
      <t>A rekeying message may include additional information, depending on the rekeying scheme used in the group, the reason that has triggered the rekeying process, and the specific target group members. In particular, if the group rekeying is performed due to one or multiple Clients that have joined the group and the KDC acts as a repository of authentication credentials of the group members, then a rekeying message <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also include the authentication credentials that those Clients use in the group, together with the roles and node identifier that each of such Clients has in the group. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to specify this information by means of the parameters 'creds', 'peer_roles', and 'peer_identifiers', like it is done in the Join Response message (see <xref target="gid-post"/>).</t>
      <t>The complete format of a rekeying message, including the encoding and content of the 'mgt_key_material' parameter, has to be defined in separate specifications aimed at profiling the used rekeying scheme in the context of the used application profile of this specification. As a particular case, an application profile of this specification <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> define additional information to include in rekeying messages for the "Point-to-Point" group rekeying scheme defined in <xref target="point-to-point-rekeying"/> (<xref target="opt14" format="none">OPT14</xref>).</t>
      <t>Consistently with the used group rekeying scheme, the actual delivery of rekeying messages can occur through different approaches, as discussed in Sections <xref target="point-to-point-rekeying" format="counter"/> and <xref target="one-to-many-rekeying" format="counter"/>.</t>
      <t>The possible, temporary misalignment of the keying material stored by the different group members due to a group rekeying is discussed in <xref target="sec-misalignment-keying-material"/>. Further security considerations related to the group rekeying process are compiled in <xref target="sec-cons-rekeying"/>.</t>
      <section anchor="point-to-point-rekeying">
        <name>Point-to-Point Group Rekeying</name>
        <t>A point-to-point group rekeying consists in the KDC sending one individual rekeying message to each target group member. In particular, the rekeying message is protected by means of the secure communication association between the KDC and the target group member in question, as per the used application profile of this specification and the used transport profile of ACE.</t>
        <t>This is the approach taken by the basic "Point-to-Point" group rekeying scheme, which the KDC can explicitly indicate in the Join Response (see <xref target="gid-post"/>), through the 'rekeying_scheme' parameter specifying the value 0.</t>
        <t>When taking this approach in the group identified by GROUPNAME, the KDC can practically deliver the rekeying messages to the target group members in different, coexisting ways.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>The KDC <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> make the /ace-group/GROUPNAME resource observable <xref target="RFC7641"/>. Thus, upon performing a group rekeying, the KDC can distribute the new group keying material through individual notification responses sent to the target group members that are also observing that resource.  </t>
            <t>
In case the KDC deletes the group (and thus deletes the /ace-group/GROUPNAME resource), relying on CoAP Observe as discussed above also allows the KDC to send an unsolicited 4.04 (Not Found) response to each observer group member as a notification of group termination. The response <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have Content-Format "application/concise-problem-details+cbor" and is formatted as defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/>. Within the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error', the value of the 'error-id' field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set to 6 ("Group deleted").</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>If a target group member specified a URI in the 'control_uri' parameter of the Join Request upon joining the group (see <xref target="gid-post"/>), the KDC can provide that group member with the new group keying material by sending a unicast POST request to that URI.  </t>
            <t>
A Client that does not plan to observe the /ace-group/GROUPNAME resource at the KDC <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> specify a URI in the 'control_uri' parameter of the Join Request upon joining the group.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>If the KDC has to send a rekeying message to a target group member, but this did not include the 'control_uri' parameter in the Join Request and is not a registered observer for the /ace-group/GROUPNAME resource, then that target group member will not be able to participate in the group rekeying. Later on, after having repeatedly failed to successfully exchange secure messages in the group, that group member can retrieve the current group keying material from the KDC, by sending a GET request to the /ace-group/GROUPNAME or /ace-group/GROUPNAME/nodes/NODENAME resource at the KDC (see Sections <xref target="gid-get" format="counter"/> and <xref target="node-get" format="counter"/>, respectively).</t>
        <t><xref target="fig-rekeying-example-1"/> provides an example of point-to-point group rekeying. In particular, the example makes the following assumptions:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The group currently consists of four group members, namely C1, C2, C3, and C4.</li>
          <li>Each group member, when joining the group, provided the KDC with a URI in the 'control_uri' parameter with url-path "grp-rek".</li>
          <li>Before the group rekeying is performed, the keying material used in the group has version number num=5.</li>
          <li>The KDC performs the group rekeying in such a way to evict the group member C3, which has been found to be compromised.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>In the example, the KDC individually rekeys the group members intended to remain in the group (i.e., C1, C2, and C4) by means of one rekeying message each.</t>

        <name>One-to-Many Group Rekeying</name>
        <t>This section provides high-level recommendations on how the KDC can rekey a group by means of a more efficient and scalable group rekeying scheme, e.g., <xref target="RFC2093"/>, <xref target="RFC2094"/>, and <xref target="RFC2627"/>. That is, each rekeying message might be, and likely is, intended for multiple target group members, and thus can be delivered to the whole group, although possible to decrypt only for the actual target group members.</t>
        <t>This yields an overall lower number of rekeying messages, thus potentially reducing the overall time required to rekey the group. On the other hand, it requires the KDC to provide and use additional administrative keying material to protect the rekeying messages and to additionally sign them to ensure source authentication (see <xref target="one-to-many-rekeying-protection"/>).</t>
        <t>Compared to a group rekeying performed in a point-to-point fashion (see <xref target="point-to-point-rekeying"/>), a one-to-many group rekeying typically pays off in large-scale groups due to the reduced time for completing the rekeying, a more efficient utilization of network resources, and a reduced performance overhead at the KDC. To different extents, it also requires individual group members to locally perform additional operations in order to handle the administrative keying material and verify source authentication of rekeying messages. Therefore, one-to-many group rekeying schemes and their employment ought to ensure that the experienced performance overhead on the group members also remains bearable for resource-constrained devices.</t>
        <t>The exact set of rekeying messages to send, their content and format, the administrative keying material to use to protect them, as well as the set of target group members depend on the specific group rekeying scheme and are typically affected by the reason that has triggered the group rekeying. Details about the data content and format of rekeying messages have to be defined by separate documents profiling the use of the group rekeying scheme in the context of the used application profile of this specification.</t>
        <t>When one of these group rekeying schemes is used, the KDC provides related information to a Client joining the group in the Join Response message (see <xref target="gid-post"/>). In particular, the 'rekeying_scheme' parameter indicates the rekeying scheme used in the group (if no default scheme can be assumed); the 'control_group_uri' parameter, if present, specifies a URI whose addressing information is, e.g., a multicast IP address where the KDC will send the rekeying messages for that group as intended to reach all the group members; and the 'mgt_key_material' parameter specifies a subset of the administrative keying material intended for that particular joining Client to have, as used to protect the rekeying messages sent to the group when also intended for that joining Client.</t>
        <t>Rekeying messages can be protected at the application layer by using COSE <xref target="RFC9052"/> and the administrative keying material as prescribed by the specific group rekeying scheme (see <xref target="one-to-many-rekeying-protection"/>). After that, the delivery of protected rekeying messages to the intended target group members can occur in different ways, such as the following ones.</t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Over multicast -</dt>
	  <dd><t>In this case, the KDC simply sends a rekeying message as a CoAP request addressed to the URI specified in the 'control_group_uri' parameter of the Join Response (see <xref target="gid-post"/>).  </t>
            <t>
If a particular rekeying message is intended for a single target group member, the KDC may alternatively protect the message using the secure communication association with that group member and deliver the message like when using the "Point-to-Point" group rekeying scheme (see <xref target="point-to-point-rekeying"/>).</t></dd>
<dt>Through a pub-sub communication model -</dt>
<dd><t>In this case, the KDC acts as a publisher and publishes each rekeying message to a specific "rekeying topic", which is associated with the group and is hosted at a Broker server. Following their group joining, the group members subscribe to the rekeying topic at the Broker, thus receiving the group rekeying messages as they are published by the KDC.  </t>
            <t>
In order to make such message delivery more efficient, the rekeying topic associated with a group can be further organized into subtopics. For instance, the KDC can use a particular subtopic to address a particular set of target group members during the rekeying process as possibly aligned to a similar organization of the administrative keying material (e.g., a key hierarchy).  </t>
            <t>
The setup of rekeying topics at the Broker as well as the discovery of the topics at the Broker for group members are application specific. A possible way is for the KDC to provide such information in the Join Response message (see <xref target="gid-post"/>) by means of a new parameter analogous to 'control_group_uri' and specifying the URI(s) of the rekeying topic(s) that a group member has to subscribe to at the Broker.</t></dd>
        </dl>
        <t>Regardless of the specifically used delivery method, the group rekeying scheme can perform a possible rollover of the administrative keying material through the same sent rekeying messages. Actually, such a rollover occurs every time a group rekeying is performed upon the leaving of group members, which have to be excluded from future communications in the group.</t>
        <t>From a high-level point of view, each group member stores only a subset of the overall administrative keying material, which is obtained upon joining the group. Then, when a group rekeying occurs:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Each rekeying message is protected by using a (most convenient) key from the administrative keying material such that: i) the used key is not stored by any node leaving the group, i.e., the key is safe to use and does not have to be renewed; and ii) the used key is stored by all the target group members that indeed have to be provided with new group keying material to protect communications in the group.</li>
          <li>Each rekeying message includes not only the new group keying material intended for all the rekeyed group members but also any new administrative keys that: i) are pertaining to and supposed to be stored by the target group members; and ii) had to be updated because leaving group members do store the previous version.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Further details depend on the specific rekeying scheme used in the group.</t>
        <t><xref target="fig-rekeying-example-2"/> provides an example of a one-to-many group rekeying over multicast. In particular, the example makes the following assumptions:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The group currently consists of four group members, namely C1, C2, C3, and C4.</li>
          <li>Each group member, when joining the group, provided the KDC with a URI in the 'control_uri' parameter with url-path "grp-rek".</li>
          <li>Each group member, when joining the group, received from the KDC a URI in the 'control_group_uri' parameter, specifying the multicast address MULT_ADDR and url-path "grp-mrek".</li>
          <li>Before the group rekeying is performed, the keying material used in the group has version number num=5.</li>
          <li>The KDC performs the group rekeying in such a way to evict the group member C3, which has been found to be compromised.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>In the example, the KDC determines that the most convenient way to perform a group rekeying that evicts C3 is as follows.</t>
        <t>First, the KDC sends one rekeying message over multicast to the multicast address MULT_ADDR and the url-path "grp-mrek". In the figure, the message is denoted with solid arrows. The message is protected with a non-compromised key from the administrative keying material that only C1 and C2 store. Therefore, even though all the group members receive this message, only C1 and C2 are able to decrypt it. The message includes: the new group keying material with version number num=6 and new keys from the administrative keying material to replace those stored by the group members C1, C2, and C3.</t>
        <t>After that, the KDC sends one rekeying message addressed individually to C4 and with url-path "grp-rek". In the figure, the message is denoted with a dotted arrow. The message is protected with the secure association shared between C4 and the KDC. The message includes: the new group keying material with version number num=6 and new keys from the administrative keying material to replace those stored by both C4 and C3.</t>

          </ul>
          <t>First, the KDC computes a COSE_Encrypt0 object as follows.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The encryption key to use is selected from the administrative keying material, as defined by the rekeying scheme used in the group.</li>
            <li>The plaintext is the actual data content of the current rekeying message.</li>
            <li>The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) is empty unless otherwise specified by separate documents profiling the use of the group rekeying scheme.</li>
            <li>
              <t>Since the KDC is the only sender of rekeying messages, the AEAD nonce can be computed as follows, where NONCE_SIZE is the size in bytes of the AEAD nonce. Separate documents profiling the use of the group rekeying scheme may define alternative ways to compute the AEAD nonce.  </t>
              <t>
The KDC considers the following values.  </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>COUNT: as a 2-byte unsigned integer associated with the used encryption key. Its value is set to 0 when starting to perform a new group rekeying instance and is incremented after each use of the encryption key.</li>
                <li>NEW_NUM: as the version number of the new group keying material to distribute in this rekeying instance, left-padded with zeros to exactly NONCE_SIZE - 2 bytes.</li>
              </ul>
              <t>
Then, the KDC computes a Partial IV as the byte string concatenation of COUNT and NEW_NUM in this order. Finally, the AEAD nonce is computed as the XOR between the Base IV and the Partial IV.  </t>
              <t>
In order to comply with the security requirements of AEAD encryption algorithms, the KDC <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> reuse the same pair (AEAD encryption key, AEAD nonce). For example, this includes not using the same encryption key from the administrative keying material more than 2<sup>16</sup> times during the same rekeying instance.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The protected header of the COSE_Encrypt0 object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the following parameters.  </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>'alg': specifying the used encryption algorithm.</li>
                <li>'kid': specifying the identifier of the encryption key from the administrative keying material used to protect the current rekeying message.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The unprotected header of the COSE_Encrypt0 object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the 'Partial IV' parameter with the value of the Partial IV computed above.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>In order to ensure source authentication, each rekeying message protected with the administrative keying material <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be signed by the KDC. To this end, the KDC computes a countersignature of the COSE_Encrypt0 object, as described in Sections <xref target="RFC9338" section="3.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> and <xref target="RFC9338" section="3.3" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref target="RFC9338"/>. In particular, the following applies when computing the countersignature.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The Countersign_structure contains the context text string "CounterSignature0".</li>
            <li>The private key of the KDC is used as the signing key.</li>
            <li>The payload is the ciphertext of the COSE_Encrypt0 object.</li>
            <li>The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) is empty, unless otherwise specified by separate documents profiling the use of a group rekeying scheme.</li>
            <li>The protected header of the signing object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the parameter 'alg', which specifies the used signature algorithm.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>If the source authentication of messages exchanged in the group is also ensured by means of signatures, then rekeying messages <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be signed using the same signature algorithm and related parameters. Also, the KDC's authentication credential including the public key to use for signature verification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provided in the Join Response through the 'kdc_cred' parameter, together with the corresponding proof-of-possession (PoP) evidence in the 'kdc_cred_verify' parameter.</t>
          <t>If source authentication of messages exchanged in the group is not ensured by means of signatures, then the administrative keying material conveyed in the 'mgt_key_material' parameter of the Join Response sent by KDC (see <xref target="gid-post"/>) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also comprise a KDC's authentication credential including the public key to use for signature verification, together with the corresponding PoP evidence. Within the 'mgt_key_material' parameter, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to specify this information by using the same format and encoding used for the parameters 'kdc_cred', 'kdc_nonce', and 'kdc_cred_verify' in the Join Response. It is up to separate documents profiling the use of the group rekeying scheme to specify such details.</t>
          <t>After that, the KDC specifies the computed countersignature in the 'Countersignature0 version 2' header parameter of the COSE_Encrypt0 object.</t>
          <t>Finally, the KDC specifies the COSE_Encrypt0 object as payload of a CoAP request, which is sent to the target group members as per the used message delivery method.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-misalignment-keying-material">
        <name>Misalignment of Group Keying Material</name>
        <t>A group member can receive a message shortly after the group has been rekeyed and new keying material has been distributed by the KDC. In the following two cases, this may result in misaligned keying material between the group members.</t>
        <t>In the first case, the sender protects a message using the old group keying material. However, the recipient receives the message after having received the new group keying material, hence it is not able to correctly process the message. A possible way to limit the impact of this issue is to preserve the old, retained group keying material for a maximum amount of time defined by the application, during which such group keying material is used solely for processing incoming messages. By doing so, the recipient can still temporarily process received messages also by using the old, retained group keying material. Note that a former (compromised) group member can take advantage of this by sending messages protected with the old, retained group keying material. Therefore, a conservative application policy should not admit the storage of old group keying material. Eventually, the sender will have obtained the new group keying material too and can possibly resend the message protected with such keying material.</t>
        <t>In the second case, the sender protects a message using the new group keying material, but the recipient receives that message before having received the new group keying material. Therefore, the recipient will not be able to correctly process the message and hence will discard it. If the recipient receives the new group keying material shortly after that and the application at the sender endpoint performs retransmissions, the former will still be able to receive and correctly process the message. In any case, the recipient should actively ask the KDC for the latest group keying material according to an application-defined policy, for instance, after a given number of unsuccessfully decrypted incoming messages.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-extended-scope">
      <name>Extended Scope Format</name>
      <t>This section defines an extended format of binary-encoded scope, which additionally specifies the semantics used to express the same access control information from the corresponding original scope.</t>
      <t>As also discussed in <xref target="ssec-authorization-response"/>, this enables a Resource Server to unambiguously process a received access token, also in case the Resource Server runs multiple applications or application profiles that involve different scope semantics.</t>
      <t>The extended format is intended only for the 'scope' claim of access tokens for the cases where the claim takes a CBOR byte string as the value. That is, the extended format does not apply to the 'scope' parameter included in ACE messages, i.e., the Authorization Request and Authorization Response exchanged between the Client and the Authorization Server (see Sections <xref target="RFC9200" section="5.8.1" sectionFormat="bare"/> and <xref target="RFC9200" section="5.8.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref target="RFC9200"/>), the AS Request Creation Hints message from the Resource Server (see <xref section="5.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>), and the Introspection Response from the Authorization Server (see <xref section="5.9.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9200"/>).</t>
      <t>The value of the 'scope' claim following the extended format is composed as follows. Given the original scope using semantics SEM and encoded as a CBOR byte string, the corresponding extended scope consists of the same CBOR byte string enclosed by a CBOR tag <xref target="RFC8949"/>, whose tag number identifies the semantics SEM.</t>
      <t>The resulting tagged CBOR byte string is used as the value of the 'scope' claim of the access token.</t>
      <t>Figures <xref target="cddl-ex-0-ext" format="counter"/> and <xref target="cddl-ex-ext" format="counter"/> build on the examples in <xref target="ssec-authorization-request"/> and show the corresponding extended scopes.</t>

      <t>The usage of the extended scope format is not limited to application profiles of this specification or to applications based on group communication. Rather, it is generally applicable to any application and application profile where access control information in the access token is expressed as a binary-encoded scope.</t>
      <t>Applications and application profiles using the extended format of scope have to specify which CBOR tag from <xref target="CBOR.Tags"/> is used for identifying the scope semantics or to register a new CBOR tag if a suitable one does not exist already (<xref target="req28" format="none">REQ28</xref>). In case there is an already existing, suitable CBOR tag, a new CBOR tag should not be registered in order to avoid code point squatting.</t>
      <t>If the binary-encoded scope uses semantics associated with a registered CoAP Content-Format <xref target="RFC7252"/> <xref target="CoAP.Content.Formats"/>, then a suitable CBOR tag associated with that CoAP Content-Format would already be registered, as defined in <xref section="4.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9277"/>.</t>
      <t>This is especially relevant when the binary encoded scope uses AIF. That is, it is expected that the definition of an AIF-specific data model comes together with the registration of CoAP Content-Formats for the relevant combinations of its Toid and Tperm values. As discussed above, this yields the automatic registration of the CBOR tags associated with those CoAP Content-Formats.</t>

      <t>The KDC is expected to support all the parameters above. Instead, a Client can support only a subset of such parameters, depending on the roles it expects to take in the joined groups or on other conditions defined in application profiles of this specification.</t>
      <t>In the following, the parameters are categorized according to the support expected by Clients. That is, a Client that supports a parameter is able to: i) use and specify it in a request message to the KDC; and ii) understand and process it if specified in a response message from the KDC. It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> of application profiles of this specification to sort their newly defined parameters according to the same categorization (<xref target="req29" format="none">REQ29</xref>).</t>
      <t>Note that the actual use of a parameter and its inclusion in a message depends on the specific exchange, the specific Client and group involved, as well as what is defined in the used application profile of this specification.</t>

      <t>A Client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the following parameters.</t>

      <t>A Client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support the following parameter.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>'get_creds': That is, not supporting this parameter would yield the inconvenient and undesirable behavior where: i) the Client does not ask for the other group members' authentication credentials upon joining the group (see <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>); and ii) later on as a group member, the Client only retrieves the authentication credentials of all group members (see <xref target="sec-key-retrieval-all"/>).</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The following conditional parameters are relevant only if specific conditions hold. It is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> of application profiles of this specification to define whether Clients must, should, or may support these parameters and under which circumstances (<xref target="req30" format="none">REQ30</xref>).</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>'client_cred' and 'client_cred_verify': These parameters are relevant for a Client that has an authentication credential to use in a joined group.</li>

        <li>'creds_repo': This parameter is relevant for a Client that has an authentication credential to use in a joined group and that makes it available from a key repository different than the KDC.</li>
        <li>'group_policies': This parameter is relevant for a Client that is interested in the specific policies used in a group, but it does not know them or cannot become aware of them before joining that group.</li>
        <li>'peer_roles': This parameter is relevant for a Client that has to know about the roles of other group members, especially when retrieving and handling their corresponding authentication credentials.</li>
        <li>'kdc_nonce', 'kdc_cred', and 'kdc_cred_verify': These parameters are relevant for a Client that joins a group for which, as per the used application profile of this specification, the KDC has an associated authentication credential and this is required for the correct group operation.</li>
        <li>'mgt_key_material': This parameter is relevant for a Client that supports an advanced rekeying scheme possibly used in the group, such as based on one-to-many rekeying messages sent over IP multicast.</li>
        <li>'control_group_uri': This parameter is relevant for a Client that also acts as a CoAP server supporting: i) the hosting of a dedicated resource for each group that the Client is interested to be a part of; and ii) the reception of one-to-many requests sent to those resources by the KDC (e.g., over IP multicast), as targeting multiple members of the corresponding group. Examples of related management operations that the KDC can perform by this means are the eviction of group members and the execution of a group rekeying process through an advanced rekeying scheme, such as based on one-to-many rekeying messages.</li>

      <t>If a Client supports the problem-details format <xref target="RFC9290"/> and the Custom Problem Detail entry 'ace-groupcomm-error' defined in <xref target="kdc-if-errors"/> of this document and is able to understand the error specified in the 'error-id' field therein, then the Client can use that information to determine what actions to take next. If the Concise Problem Details data item specified in the error response includes the 'detail' entry and the Client supports it, such an entry may provide additional context.</t>
      <t>In particular, the following guidelines apply, and application profiles of this specification can define more detailed actions for the Client to take when learning that a specific error has occurred.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>In case of error 0, the Client should stop sending the request in question to the KDC. Rather, the Client should first join the targeted group. If it has not happened already, this first requires the Client to obtain an appropriate access token authorizing access to the group and provide it to the KDC.</li>
        <li>In case of error 1, the Client as a group member should rejoin the group with all the roles needed to perform the operation in question. This might require the Client to first obtain a new access token and provide it to the KDC, if the current access token does not authorize the Client to take those roles in the group. For operations admitted to a Client that is not a group member (e.g., an external signature verifier), the Client should first obtain a new access token authorizing to also have the missing roles.</li>
        <li>In case of error 2, the Client has to obtain or self-generate a different asymmetric key pair, as aligned to the public key algorithm and parameters used in the targeted group. After that, the Client should provide the KDC with its new authentication credential, which is consistent with the format used in the targeted group and including the new public key.</li>
        <li>In case of error 3, the Client should ensure to compute its proof-of-possession evidence by correctly using the parameters and procedures defined in the used application profile of this specification. In an unattended setup, it might not be possible for a Client to autonomously diagnose the error and take an effective next action to address it.</li>
        <li>In case of error 4, the Client should wait for a certain (pre-configured) amount of time before trying to resend its request to the KDC.</li>
        <li>In case of error 5, the Client may try joining the group again. This might require the Client to first obtain a new access token and provide it to the KDC, e.g., if the current access token has expired.</li>
        <li>In case of error 6, the Client should clean up its state regarding the group, just like if it has left the group with no intention to rejoin it.</li>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Security considerations are inherited from the ACE framework <xref target="RFC9200"/> and from the specific transport profile of ACE used between the Clients and the KDC, e.g., <xref target="RFC9202"/> and <xref target="RFC9203"/>.</t>
      <t>When using the problem-details format defined in <xref target="RFC9290"/> for error responses, then the privacy and security considerations from Sections <xref target="RFC9290" section="4" sectionFormat="bare"/> and <xref target="RFC9290" section="5" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref target="RFC9290"/> also apply.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, the following security considerations apply.</t>
      <section anchor="sec-cons-communication">
        <name>Secure Communication in the Group</name>
        <t>When a group member receives a message from a certain sender for the first time since joining the group, it needs to have a mechanism in place to avoid replayed messages and to assert their freshness, e.g., as described in <xref section="B.1.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8613"/> or <xref section="10" sectionFormat="of" target="I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm"/>. Such a mechanism also aids the recipient group member in case it has rebooted and lost the security state used to protect previous group communications with that sender.</t>
        <t>By its nature, the KDC is invested with a large amount of trust, since it acts as a generator and provider of the symmetric keying material used to protect communications in each of its groups. While details depend on the specific communication and security protocols used in the group, the KDC is in the position to decrypt messages exchanged in the group as if it was also a group member, as long as those are protected through commonly shared group keying material.</t>
        <t>A compromised KDC would thus put the attacker in the same position, which also means that:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The attacker can generate and control new group keying material, hence possibly rekeying the group and evicting certain group members as part of a broader attack.</li>
          <li>The attacker can actively participate in communications in a group, even without having been authorized to join it, and can allow further unauthorized entities to do so.</li>
          <li>The attacker can build erroneous associations between node identifiers and group members' authentication credentials.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>On the other hand, as long as the security protocol used in the group ensures source authentication of messages (e.g., by means of signatures), the KDC is not able to impersonate group members since it does not have their private keys.</t>
        <t>Further security considerations are specific to the communication and security protocols used in the group, and thus have to be provided by those protocols and complemented by the application profiles of this specification using them.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-cons-rekeying">
        <name>Update of Group Keying Material</name>
        <t>The KDC can generate new group keying material and provide it to the group members (rekeying) through the rekeying scheme used in the group, as discussed in <xref target="sec-group-rekeying"/>.</t>
        <t>In particular, the KDC must renew the latest group keying material upon its expiration. Before then, the KDC <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also renew the group keying material on a regular or periodical fashion.</t>
        <t>Unless otherwise defined by an application profile of this specification, the KDC <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> renew the group keying material upon a group membership change. As a possible exception, the KDC may not rekey the group upon the joining of a new group member if the application does not require backward security. As another possible exception discussed more in detail later in this section, the KDC may rely on a rekeying policy that reasonably takes into account the expected rate of group membership changes and the duration of a group rekeying.</t>
        <t>Since the minimum number of group members is one, the KDC <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide even a Client joining an empty group with new keying material never used before in that group. Similarly, the KDC <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also provide new group keying material to a Client that remains the only member in the group after the leaving of other group members.</t>
        <t>Note that the considerations in <xref target="sec-cons-communication"/> about dealing with replayed messages still hold, even in case the KDC rekeys the group upon every single joining of a new group member. However, if the KDC has renewed the group keying material upon a group member's joining and the time interval between the end of the rekeying process and that member's joining is sufficiently small, then that group member is also on the safe side, since it would not accept replayed messages protected with the old group keying material previous to its joining.</t>
        <t>Once a joining node has obtained the new, latest keying material through a Join Response from the KDC (see <xref target="ssec-key-distribution-exchange"/>), the joining node becomes able to read any message that was exchanged in the group and protected with that keying material. This is the case if the KDC provides the current group members with the new, latest keying material before completing the joining procedure. However, the joining node is not able to read messages exchanged in the group and protected with keying material older than the one provided in the Join Response, i.e., having a strictly lower version number NUM.</t>
        <t>A node that has left the group should not expect any of its outgoing messages to be successfully processed if received by other nodes in the group after its leaving due to a possible group rekeying occurring before the message reception.</t>
        <t>The KDC may enforce a rekeying policy that takes into account the overall time required to rekey the group, as well as the expected rate of changes in the group membership. That is, the KDC may not rekey the group at each and every group membership change, for instance, if members' joining and leaving occur frequently and performing a group rekeying takes too long. Instead, the KDC might rekey the group after a minimum number of group members have joined or left within a given time interval, after a maximum amount of time since the last group rekeying was completed, or yet during predictable network inactivity periods.</t>
        <t>However, this would result in the KDC not constantly preserving backward and forward security in the group. That is:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Newly joining group members would be able to access the keying material used before their joining, and thus they could access past group communications if they have recorded old exchanged messages. This might still be acceptable for some applications and in situations where the new group members are freshly deployed through strictly controlled procedures.</li>
          <li>The leaving group members would remain able to access upcoming group communications, as protected with the current keying material that has not been updated. This is typically undesirable, especially if the leaving group member is compromised or suspected to be, and it might impact or compromise the security properties of the protocols used in the group to protect messages exchanged among the group members.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The KDC should renew the group keying material in case it has rebooted, even if it stores the whole group keying material in persistent storage. This assumes that the secure communication associations with the current group members as well as any administrative keying material required to rekey the group are also stored in persistent storage.</t>
        <t>However, if the KDC relies on Observe notifications to distribute the new group keying material, the KDC would have lost all the current ongoing Observations with the group members after rebooting, and the group members would continue using the old group keying material. Therefore, the KDC will rely on each group member asking for the new group keying material (see Sections <xref target="ssec-key-material-retrieval" format="counter"/> and <xref target="update-keys" format="counter"/>) or perform a group rekeying by actively sending rekeying messages to group members as discussed in <xref target="sec-group-rekeying"/>.</t>
        <t>The KDC needs to have a mechanism in place to detect DoS attacks from nodes repeatedly performing actions that might trigger a group rekeying. Such actions can include leaving and/or rejoining the group at high rates or often asking the KDC for new individual keying material. Ultimately, the KDC can resort to removing these nodes from the group and (temporarily) preventing them from joining the group again.</t>
        <t>The KDC also needs to have a congestion control mechanism in place in order to avoid network congestion upon distributing new group keying material. For example, CoAP and Observe give guidance on such mechanisms, see <xref section="4.7" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7252"/> and <xref section="4.5.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7641"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="block-wise-considerations">
        <name>Block-Wise Considerations</name>
        <t>If the Block-Wise CoAP options <xref target="RFC7959"/> are used and the keying material is updated in the middle of a Block-Wise transfer, the sender of the blocks just changes the group keying material to the updated one and continues the transfer. As long as both sides get the new group keying material, updating the group keying material in the middle of a transfer will not cause any issue. Otherwise, the sender will have to transmit the message again when receiving an error message from the recipient.</t>
        <t>Compared to a scenario where the transfer does not use Block-Wise, and depending on how fast the group keying material is changed, the group members might consume a larger amount of the network bandwidth by repeatedly resending the same blocks, which might be problematic.</t>

This section gives some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason so they should be given substantial latitude.</t>
        <t>Expert Reviewers should take into consideration the following points:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Point squatting should be discouraged. Reviewers are encouraged to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already registered and that the point is likely to be used in deployments. The zones tagged as "Private Use" are intended for testing purposes and closed environments; code points in other ranges should not be assigned for testing.</li>
          <li>Specifications are required for the Standards Track range of point assignment. Specifications should exist for Specification Required ranges, but early assignment before a specification is available is considered to be permissible. When specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to have sufficient information to identify what the point is being used for.</li>
          <li>Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when approving point assignments. The fact that there is a range for Standards Track documents does not mean that a Standards Track document cannot have points assigned outside of that range. The length of the encoded value should be weighed against how many code points of that length are left, the size of the device it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode to that size.</li>
        </ul>

      <t>As defined in <xref section="8.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9053"/>, future algorithms can be registered in the "COSE Algorithms" registry <xref target="COSE.Algorithms"/> as specifying none or multiple COSE capabilities.</t>
      <t>To enable the seamless use of such future registered algorithms, this section defines a general, agile format for each 'sign_info_entry' of the 'sign_info' parameter in the Token Transfer Response; see <xref target="sign-info"/>.</t>
      <t>If any of the currently registered COSE algorithms are considered, using this general format yields the same structure of 'sign_info_entry' defined in this document, thus ensuring backward compatibility.</t>
      <section anchor="sec-future-cose-algs-sign-info-entry">
        <name>Format of 'sign_info_entry'</name>
        <t>The format of each 'sign_info_entry' (see <xref target="sign-info"/>) is generalized as follows.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>'sign_parameters' includes N &gt;= 0 elements, each of which is a COSE capability of the signature algorithm indicated in 'sign_alg'.  </t>
            <t>
In particular, 'sign_parameters' has the same format and value of the COSE capabilities array for the signature algorithm indicated in 'sign_alg', as specified for that algorithm in the "Capabilities" column of the "COSE Algorithms" registry <xref target="COSE.Algorithms"/>.</t>
          </li>

            <t>'sign_key_parameters' is replaced by N elements 'sign_capab', each of which is a CBOR array.  </t>

The i-th 'sign_capab' array (i = 0, ..., N-1) is the array of COSE capabilities for the algorithm capability specified in 'sign_parameters'[i].  </t>
            <t>
In particular, each 'sign_capab' array has the same format and value of the COSE capabilities array for the algorithm capability specified in 'sign_parameters'[i].  </t>
