      <t>
   The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport
   (ROUTE) protocol is specified for robust delivery of Application Objects,
   including Application Objects with real-time delivery constraints, to
   receivers over a unidirectional transport.  Application Objects consist of
   data that has meaning to applications that use the ROUTE protocol for
   delivery of data to receivers; for example, it can be a file, a Dynamic
   Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) or HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) segment, a
   WAV audio clip, etc. The ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency streaming
   applications.</t>
      <t>
   The ROUTE protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast, and multicast
   transport. Therefore, it can be run over UDP/IP, including multicast
   IP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying
   protocol layer, e.g., to provide security, it can leverage IP security
   protocols such as IPsec.</t>
      <t>
   This document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could be used
   by a variety of services for delivery of Application Objects by
   specifying their own profiles of this protocol (e.g., by adding or
   constraining some features).</t>
      <t>
   This is not an IETF specification and does not have IETF consensus.</t>

        <t>
   The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport
   (ROUTE) protocol can be used for robust delivery of
   Application Objects, including Application Objects with real-time
   delivery constraints, to receivers over a unidirectional transport.
   Unidirectional transport in this document has identical meaning to that in
   RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726" format="default"/>, i.e., transport in the direction of receiver(s)
   from a sender. The robustness is enabled by a built-in mechanism, e.g.,
   signaling for loss detection, enabling loss recovery, and optionally
   integrating application-layer Forward Error Correction (FEC).</t>
        <t>
   Application Objects consist of data that has meaning to applications
   that use the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers, e.g.,
   an Application Object can be a file, an MPEG Dynamic Adaptive
   Streaming over HTTP (DASH) <xref target="DASH"/> video segment, a WAV audio clip, an
   MPEG Common Media Application Format (CMAF) <xref target="CMAF"/> addressable
   resource, an MPEG-4 video clip, etc.</t>
   
   <t>
   The ROUTE protocol is designed to enable delivery of sequences of
   related Application Objects in a timely manner to receivers, e.g., a
   sequence of DASH video segments associated to a Representation or a
   sequence of CMAF addressable resources associated to a CMAF Track.
   The applications of this protocol target services enabled on media
   consumption devices such as smartphones, tablets, television sets, and
   so on. Most of these applications are real-time in the sense that
   they are sensitive to and rely upon such timely reception of data.
   The ROUTE protocol also supports chunked delivery of real-time
   Application Objects to enable low-latency streaming applications
   (similar in its properties to chunked delivery using HTTP). The
   protocol also enables low-latency delivery of DASH and Apple HTTP
   Live Streaming (HLS) content with CMAF Chunks.</t>
        <t>
   Content not intended for rendering in real time as it is received
   (e.g., a downloaded application), a file comprising continuous or
   discrete media and belonging to an app-based feature, or a file
   containing (opaque) data to be consumed by a Digital Rights
   Management (DRM) system client can also be delivered by ROUTE.</t>


   <t>
   The ROUTE protocol supports a caching model where Application
   Objects are recovered into a cache at the receiver and may be made
   available to applications via standard HTTP requests from the cache.
   Many current day applications rely on using HTTP to access content;
   hence, this approach enables such applications in
   broadcast/multicast environments.</t>
        <t>
   ROUTE is aligned with File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE)
   as defined in RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726" format="default"/> as well as
   the extensions defined in Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS)
   <xref target="MBMS"/>, but it also makes use of some principles of
   FCAST (Object Delivery for the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) and
   NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) Protocols) as defined in RFC 6968 <xref
   target="RFC6968" format="default"/>; for example, object metadata and the
   object content may be sent together in a compound object.</t>


   <t>
   The alignment to FLUTE is enabled since in addition to reusing
   several of the basic FLUTE protocol features, as referred to by this
   document, certain optimizations and restrictions are added that
   enable optimized support for real-time delivery of media data; hence,
   the name of the protocol. Among others, the source ROUTE protocol
   enables or enhances the following functionalities:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Real-time delivery of object-based media data</li>
          <li>Flexible packetization, including enabling media-aware
      packetization as well as transport-aware packetization of delivery
      objects</li>
          <li>Independence of Application Objects and delivery objects, i.e., a
      delivery object may be a part of a file or may be a group of
      files.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) 3.0 specifies the ROUTE
   protocol integrated with an ATSC 3.0 services layer. That
   specification will be referred to as ATSC-ROUTE <xref target="ATSCA331"/> for the
   remainder of this document. Digital Video Broadcasting  (DVB) has specified a profile of ATSC-ROUTE
   in DVB Adaptive Media Streaming over IP Multicast (DVB-MABR)
   <xref target="DVBMABR"/>. This document specifies the Application Object delivery
   aspects (delivery protocol) for such services, as the corresponding
   delivery protocol could be used as a reference by a variety of
   services by specifying profiles of ROUTE in their respective fora,
   e.g., by adding new optional features atop or by restricting various
   optional features specified in this document in a specific service
   standard. Hence, in the context of this document, the aforementioned
   ATSC-ROUTE and DVB-MABR are the services using ROUTE. The definition
   of profiles by the services also have to give due consideration to
   compatibility issues, and some related guidelines are also provided
   in this document.</t>
        <t>
   This document is not an IETF specification and does not have IETF
   consensus. It is provided here to aid the production of interoperable
   implementations.</t>

        <t>
   ROUTE delivers Application Objects such as MPEG DASH or HLS segments
   and optionally the associated repair data, operating over UDP/IP
   networks, as depicted in <xref target="protocol-layering"/>. The session metadata signaling to
   realize a ROUTE session as specified in this document <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be delivered
   out of band or in band as well. Since ROUTE delivers objects in an
   application cache at the receiver from where the application can
   access them using HTTP, an application like DASH may use its
   standardized unicast streaming mechanisms in conjunction with ROUTE
   over broadcast/multicast to augment the services. </t>

        <name>Data Model</name>
        <t>
   The ROUTE data model is constituted by the following key concepts.

        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="6">
          <dt>Application Object:</dt>
          <dd> data that has meaning to the application that
   uses the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers, e.g., an
   Application Object can be a file, a DASH video segment, a WAV
   audio clip, an MPEG-4 video clip, etc.</dd>
          <dt>Delivery Object:</dt>
          <dd> an object on course of delivery to the application
   from the ROUTE sender to ROUTE receiver.</dd>
          <dt>Transport Object:</dt>
          <dd> an object identified by the Transport Object Identifier (TOI)
          in RFC 5651 <xref target="RFC5651" format="default"/>. It
          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be either a source or a repair object, depending on if it is
          carried by a Source Flow or a Repair Flow, respectively.</dd>
          <dt>Transport Session:</dt>
          <dd>a Layered Coding Transport (LCT) channel, as
   defined by RFC 5651 <xref target="RFC5651" format="default"/>. A Transport Session <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be uniquely
   identified by a unique Transport Session Identifier (TSI) value in
   the LCT header. The TSI is scoped by the IP address of the sender,
   and the IP address of the sender together with the TSI uniquely
   identify the session. Transport Sessions are a subset of a ROUTE
   session. For media delivery, a Transport Session would typically
   carry a media component, for example, a DASH Representation. Within
   each Transport Session, one or more objects are carried, typically
   objects that are related, e.g., DASH segments associated to one
	  Representation.</dd>


          <dt>ROUTE Session:</dt>
          <dd>an ensemble or multiplex of one or more
   Transport Sessions. Each ROUTE session is associated with an IP
   address/port combination. A ROUTE session typically carries one or more media
   components of streaming media e.g., Representations associated with a DASH
   Media Presentation.</dd>
          <dt>Source Flow:</dt>
          <dd>a Transport Session carrying source data. Source Flow is
   independent of the Repair Flow, i.e., the Source Flow <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used by
   a ROUTE receiver without the ROUTE Repair Flows.</dd>
          <dt>Repair Flow:</dt>
          <dd>a Transport Session carrying repair data for one
   or more Source Flows.</dd>

        <name>Architecture and Scope of Specification</name>

	<t>
   The scope of the ROUTE protocol is to enable robust and real-time transport of
   delivery objects using LCT packets. This architecture is depicted in
   <xref target="architecture-diagram"/>.</t>
        <t>
   The normative aspects of the ROUTE protocol focus on the following
   aspects:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The format of the LCT packets that carry the transport objects.</li>
          <li>The robust transport of the delivery object using a repair
      protocol based on Forward Error Correction (FEC).</li>
          <li>The definition and possible carriage of object metadata along with
      the delivery objects. Metadata may be conveyed in LCT packets
      and/or separate objects.</li>
          <li>The ROUTE session, LCT channel, and delivery object description
      provided as service metadata signaling to enable the reception of
      objects.</li>
          <li>The normative aspects (formats, semantics) of the delivery
          objects conveyed as a content manifest to be delivered along with
          the objects to optimize the performance for specific applications
          e.g., real-time delivery. The objects and manifest are made
          available to the application through an Application Object cache.
          The interface of this cache to the application is not specified in
          this document; however, it will typically be enabled by the
          application acting as an HTTP client and the cache as the HTTP
          server.</li>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>ROUTE limits the usage of the LCT building block to a single

     field is either set to 0 or used for other purposes as specified
     in <xref target="sect-2.1" format="default"/>. The functionality of receiver-driven layered
     multicast may still be offered by the application, allowing the

        <t>
   The following description of the ROUTE sender operation on the
   mapping of the Application Object to the ROUTE packet payloads
   logically represents an extension of RFC 5445 <xref target="RFC5445" format="default"/>, which in
   turn inherits the context, language, declarations, and restrictions of
   the FEC building block in RFC 5052 <xref target="RFC5052" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   The data carried in the payload of a given ROUTE packet constitutes a
   contiguous portion of the Application Object. ROUTE source delivery
   can be considered as a special case of the use of the Compact No-Code
   Scheme associated with FEC Encoding ID = 0 according to Sections
   <xref target="RFC5445" sectionFormat="bare" section="3.4.1" /> and <xref target="RFC5445" sectionFormat="bare" section="3.4.2"/> of <xref target="RFC5445" format="default"/>, in which the encoding symbol
   size is exactly one byte. As specified in <xref target="sect-2.1" format="default"/>, for ROUTE
   Source Flows, the FEC Payload ID <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> deliver the 32-bit
   start_offset. All receivers are expected to support, at minimum,
   operation with this special case of the Compact No-Code FEC.</t>
        <t>
   Note that in the event the source object size is greater than 2<sup>32</sup> bytes
   (approximately 4.3 GB), the applications (in the broadcaster server and the
   receiver) are expected to perform segmentation/reassembly using methods
   beyond the scope of this document.</t>
        <t>
   Finally, in some special cases, a ROUTE sender <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> need to produce
   ROUTE packets that do not contain any payload. This may be required,
   for example, to signal the end of a session. These dataless packets
   do not contain FEC Payload ID or payload data, but only the LCT
   header fields. The total datagram length, conveyed by outer protocol
   headers (e.g., the IP or UDP header), enables receivers to detect the
   absence of the LCT header, FEC Payload ID, and payload data.</t>

        <name>FEC Transport Object Construction</name>
        <t>
   In order to identify a delivery object in the context of the repair
   protocol, the following information is needed:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>TSI and TOI of the delivery object. In this case, the FEC object
     corresponds to the (entire) delivery object.</li>
          <li>Octet range of the delivery object, i.e., start offset within the delivery
     object and number of subsequent and contiguous octets of delivery object
     that constitutes the FEC object (i.e., the FEC-protected portion of the
     source object). In this case, the FEC object corresponds to a contiguous
     byte range portion of the delivery object.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   Typically, for real-time object delivery with smaller delivery object
   sizes, the first mapping is applied, i.e., the delivery object is a
   FEC object.</t>
        <t>
   Assuming that the FEC object is the delivery object, for each
   delivery object, the associated FEC transport object is comprised of
   the concatenation of the delivery object, padding octets (P), and the
   FEC object size (F) in octets, where F is carried in a 4-octet field.</t>
        <t>
   The FEC transport object size S, in FEC encoding symbols, <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be an
   integer multiple of the symbol size Y.  S is determined from the session
   information and/or the repair packet headers.</t>
        <t>
   F is carried in the last 4 octets of the FEC transport object.
   Specifically, let:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>F be the size of the delivery object in octets,</li>
          <li>F' be the F octets of data of the delivery object,</li>
          <li>f' denote the four octets of data carrying the value of F in
     network octet order (high-order octet first),</li>
          <li>S be the size of the FEC transport object with S=ceil((F+4)/Y),
     where the ceil() function rounds the result upward to its nearest
     integer,</li>
          <li>P' be S*Y-4-F octets of data, i.e., padding placed between the
     delivery object and the 4-byte field conveying the value of F and
     located at the end of the FEC transport object, and</li>
          <li>O' be the concatenation of F', P', and f'.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   O' then constitutes the FEC transport object of size S*Y octets. Note
   that padding octets and the object size F are not sent in source
   packets of the delivery object but are only part of a FEC transport
   object that FEC decoding recovers in order to extract the FEC object
   and thus the delivery object or portion of the delivery object that
   constitutes the FEC object. In the above context, the FEC transport
   object size in symbols is S.</t>
        <t>

   In File Mode, the delivery object represents an Application Object. This
   mode replicates FLUTE as defined in RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726"
   format="default"/> but with the ability to send static and pre-known file
   metadata out of band.</t>
        <t>
   In FLUTE, FDT-Instances are delivered in band and need to be generated and
   delivered in real time if objects are generated in real time at the
   sender. These FDT-Instances have some differences as compared to the FDT
   specified in <xref target="RFC6726" sectionFormat="of" section="3.4.2"/> and Section 7.2.10 of MBMS
   <xref target="MBMS"/>. The key difference is that besides separated delivery of file
   metadata from the delivery object it describes, the FDT functionality in
   ROUTE may be extended by additional file metadata and rules that enable the
   receiver to generate the Content-Location attribute of the File element of
   the FDT, on the fly. This is done by using information in both the
   extensions to the FDT and the LCT header. The combination of pre-delivery
   of static file metadata and receiver self generation of dynamic file
   metadata avoids the necessity of continuously sending the FDT-Instances for
   real-time objects. Such modified FDT functionality in ROUTE is referred to
   as the Extended FDT.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-9.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>In-Band Signaling of Object Transfer Length</name>
        <t>
   As an extension to FLUTE, ROUTE allows for using EXT_TOL LCT header
   extension with 24 bits or, if required, 48 bits to signal the Transfer
   Length directly within the ROUTE packet.</t>


   <t>
   The transport object length can also be determined without the use of
   EXT_TOL by examining the LCT packet with the Close Object flag (B).
   However, if this packet is lost, then the EXT_TOL information can be
   used by the receiver to determine the transport object length.</t>
        <t>
   Applications using ROUTE for delivery of low-latency streaming content may
   make use of this feature for sender-end latency optimizations: the sender
   does not have to wait for the completion of the packaging of a whole
   Application Object to find its Transfer Length to be included in the FDT
   before the sending can start.  Rather, partially encoded data can already
   be started to be sent via the ROUTE sender. As the time approaches when the
   encoding of the Application Object is nearing completion, and the length of
   the object becomes known (e.g., the time of writing the last CMAF Chunk of
   a DASH segment), only then the sender can signal the object length using
   the EXT TOL LCT header. For example, for a 2-second DASH segment with
   100-millisecond chunks, it may result in saving up to 1.9 second latency at
   the sending end.</t>

        <name>Repair Protocol Concepts</name>

        <t>
   The ROUTE repair protocol is FEC-based and is enabled as an additional
   layer between the transport layer (e.g., UDP) and the object delivery layer
   protocol. The FEC reuses concepts of the FEC Framework defined in RFC 6363
   <xref target="RFC6363" format="default"/>, but in contrast to the FEC
   Framework in RFC 6363 <xref target="RFC6363" format="default"/>, the ROUTE
   repair protocol does not protect packets but instead protects delivery
   objects as delivered in the source protocol. In addition, as an extension
   to FLUTE, it supports the protection of multiple objects in one source
   block which is in alignment with the FEC Framework as defined in RFC 6363
   <xref target="RFC6363" format="default"/>. Each FEC source block may
   consist of parts of a delivery object, as a single delivery object (similar
   to FLUTE) or multiple delivery objects that are bundled prior to FEC
   protection.  ROUTE FEC makes use of FEC schemes in a similar way as those
   defined in RFC 5052 <xref target="RFC5052" format="default"/> and uses the
   terminology of that document. The FEC scheme defines the FEC encoding and
   decoding as well as the protocol fields and procedures used to identify
   packet payload data in the context of the FEC scheme.</t>
        <t>
   In ROUTE, all packets are LCT packets as defined in RFC 5651
   <xref target="RFC5651" format="default"/>. Source and repair packets may be distinguished by:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Different ROUTE sessions, i.e., they are carried on different
     UDP/IP port combinations.</li>
          <li>Different LCT channels, i.e., they use different TSI values in the
     LCT header.</li>
          <li>The most significant PSI bit in the LCT, if carried in the same LCT
     channel. This mode of operation is mostly suitable for FLUTE-compatible
     deployments.</li>

      <name>Security and Privacy Considerations</name>
      <section anchor="sect-11.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Security Considerations</name>

	<t>
   As noted in <xref target="sect-9" format="default"/>, ROUTE is aligned with
   FLUTE as specified in RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726" format="default"/>
   and only diverges in certain signaling optimizations, especially for the
   real-time object delivery case. Hence, most of the security considerations
   documented in RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726" format="default"/> for the
   data flow itself, the session metadata (session control parameters in RFC
   6726 <xref target="RFC6726" format="default"/>), and the associated
   building blocks apply directly to ROUTE as elaborated in the following
   along with some additional considerations.</t>
        <t>
   Both encryption and integrity protection applied either on file or
   packet level, as recommended in the file corruption considerations of RFC
   6726 <xref target="RFC6726" format="default"/>, <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used for ROUTE. Additionally, RFC 3740
   <xref target="RFC3740" format="default"/> documents multicast security architecture in great detail
   with clear security recommendations that <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be followed.</t>
        <t>
   When ROUTE is carried over UDP and a reverse channel from receiver to
   sender is available, the security mechanisms provided in RFC 9147
   <xref target="RFC9147" format="default"/> <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be applied.</t>
        <t>
   In regard to considerations for attacks against session description, this
   document does not specify the semantics or mechanism of delivery of session
   metadata, though the same threats apply for service using ROUTE as
   well. Hence, a service using ROUTE <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> take these threats
   into consideration and address them appropriately following the guidelines
   provided by RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726"
   format="default"/>. Additionally, to the recommendations of RFC 6726 <xref
   target="RFC6726" format="default"/>, for Internet connected devices,
   services <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> enable clients to access the session
   description information using HTTPS with customary
   authentication/authorization, instead of sending this data via
   multicast/broadcast, since considerable security work has been done already
   in this unicast domain, which can enable highly secure access of session
   description data. Accessing via unicast, however, will have different privacy
   considerations, noted in <xref target="sect-11.2" format="default"/>. Note
   that in general the multicast/broadcast stream is delayed with respect to
   the unicast stream.  Therefore, the session description protocol
   <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be time synchronized with the broadcast stream,
   particularly if the session description contains security-related
   information.</t>
        <t>
   In regard to FDT, there is one key difference for File Mode when using File
   Template in EFDT, which avoids repeated sending of FDT-Instances and hence,
   the corresponding threats noted in RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726"
   format="default"/> do not apply directly to ROUTE in this case. The threat,
   however, is shifted to the ALC/LCT headers, since they carry the additional
   signaling that enables determining Content-Location and
   File@Transfer-Length in this case. Hence, integrity protection
   recommendations of ALC/LCT header <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be considered with
   higher emphasis in this case for ROUTE.</t>
        <t>
   Finally, attacks against the congestion control building block for
   the case of ROUTE can impact the optional fast stream acquisition
   specified in <xref target="sect-6.2" format="default"/>. Receivers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have robustness against
   timestamp values that are suspicious, e.g., by comparing the signaled
   time in the LCT headers with the approximate time signaled by the
   MPD, and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> discard outlying values. Additionally, receivers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   adhere to the expiry timelines as specified in <xref target="sect-6" format="default"/>. Integrity
   protection mechanisms documented in RFC 6726 <xref target="RFC6726" format="default"/> <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used
   to address this threat.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-11.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
        <t>
   Encryption mechanisms recommended for security considerations in
   <xref target="sect-11.1" format="default"/> <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also be applied to enable privacy and protection
   from snooping attacks.</t>
        <t>
   Since this protocol is primarily targeted for IP multicast/broadcast
   environments where the end user is mostly listening, identity
   protection and user data retention considerations are more protected
   than in the unicast case. Best practices for enabling privacy on IP
   multicast/broadcast <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be applied by the operators, e.g.,
   "<xref target="RFC8932" format="title"/>" in RFC 8932
   <xref target="RFC8932" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   However, if clients access session description information via HTTPS,
   the same privacy considerations and solutions <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> apply to this
   access as for regular HTTPS communication, an area that is very well
   studied and the concepts of which are being integrated directly into
   newer transport protocols such as IETF QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" format="default"/> enabling HTTP/3
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-http" format="default"/>. Hence, such newer protocols <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used to foster privacy.</t>
        <t>
   Note that streaming services <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain content that may only be
   accessed via DRM (digital rights management) systems.  DRM systems
   can prevent unauthorized access to content delivered via ROUTE.</t>
