    <abstract>
      <t>The document describes the reservation of an additional IPv6 address
      prefix for use in documentation. This update to RFC 3849 expands on the
      existing 2001:db8::/32 address block with the reservation of an
      additional, larger prefix.  The addition of a /20 prefix allows
      documented examples to more closely reflect a broader range of
      realistic, current deployment scenarios and more closely aligns with
      contemporary allocation models for large networks.

      <name>Introduction</name>


      <t><xref target="RFC3849"/> introduced the IPv6 address prefix
      2001:db8::/32 as a reserved prefix for use in documentation.  The
      rationale for this reservation was to reduce the likelihood of conflict
      and confusion when relating documented examples to deployed systems.</t>
      <t>As the global deployment of IPv6 expands and evolves, individual IPv6
network deployment scenarios have also increased in size and diversity, and
there is a requirement for documentation to reflect this increased diversity
and scope. The original 2001:db8::/32 reservation is inadequate to describe
many realistic, current deployment scenarios.</t>

<t>Without this additional address allocation, documentation prefixes
are drawn from address blocks already allocated or assigned to existing
organizations or well-known ISPs, or they are drawn from the currently unallocated
address pool. Such use conflicts with existing or future allocations or
assignments of IPv6 address space. The reservation of a /20 IPv6
address prefix from the Global Unicast Address pool <xref target="RFC4291"/> for
documentation purposes allows such conflicts to be avoided.</t>

    <section anchor="current-assignment-and-allocation-data">
      <name>Current Assignment and Allocation Data</name>

      <t>According to the allocation and assignment data published by the Regional
Internet Registries (RIRs) (see
<xref target="NROStatsReport"/>),
in August 2023, 25.9% of the 62,770 recorded IPv6 unicast allocations and
assignments were larger than a /32 in size. The most common allocation or
assignment size was a /29, used in 24.8% of cases.</t>

<t>The four largest assignments made to end users have been /19s, but these
allocations were made before the RIRs moved away from the use of a fixed /48
site address prefix in IPv6 address assignment policies, and in the
foreseeable future, it is unlikely that individual networks will require more
than a /20.  It is believed that reservation of a /20 will cover the
documentation needs as they relate to the broad range of realistic network
deployments.</t>

      <name>Filtering and Appropriate Use</name>
      <t>Documentation prefixes are for the use of relaying configuration and
      documentation examples, and as such, they <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
      used for actual traffic, <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be globally advertised,
      and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be used internally for routed production
      traffic or other connectivity.  Documentation prefixes should be
      considered bogon <xref target="BOGON"/> and filtered in routing
      advertisements as appropriate.</t>

      <t>This special-use prefix should be marked as and considered bogon

      whose source or destination belongs to this prefix should be dropped and
      disallowed over the public Internet.
