      <t>This specification defines QPACK: a compression format for efficiently
representing HTTP fields that is to be used in HTTP/3. This is a variation of
HPACK compression that seeks to reduce head-of-line blocking.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The QUIC transport protocol (<xref target="QUIC-TRANSPORT"/>) is designed to support
HTTP semantics, and its design subsumes many of the features of HTTP/2
(<xref target="HTTP2"/>). HTTP/2 uses HPACK (<xref target="RFC7541"/>) for compression of the header
and trailer sections.  If HPACK were used for HTTP/3 (<xref target="HTTP3"/>), it would
induce head-of-line blocking for field sections due to built-in assumptions of a
total ordering across frames on all streams.</t>
      <t>QPACK reuses core concepts from HPACK, but is redesigned to allow correctness in
the presence of out-of-order delivery, with flexibility for implementations to
balance between resilience against head-of-line blocking and optimal compression
ratio.  The design goals are to closely approach the compression ratio of HPACK
with substantially less head-of-line blocking under the same loss conditions.</t>

    <section anchor="compression-process-overview">
      <name>Compression Process Overview</name>
      <t>Like HPACK, QPACK uses two tables for associating field lines ("headers") to
indices.  The static table (<xref target="header-table-static"/>) is predefined and contains
common header field lines (some of them with an empty value).  The dynamic table
(<xref target="header-table-dynamic"/>) is built up over the course of the connection and can
be used by the encoder to index both header and trailer field lines in the
encoded field sections.</t>
      <t>QPACK defines unidirectional streams for sending instructions from encoder to
decoder and vice versa.</t>
      <section anchor="encoder">
        <name>Encoder</name>
        <t>An encoder converts a header or trailer section into a series of representations
by emitting either an indexed or a literal representation for each field line in
the list; see <xref target="field-line-representations"/>.  Indexed representations achieve
high compression by replacing the literal name and possibly the value with an
index to either the static or dynamic table.  References to the static table and
literal representations do not require any dynamic state and never risk
head-of-line blocking.  References to the dynamic table risk head-of-line
blocking if the encoder has not received an acknowledgment indicating the entry
is available at the decoder.</t>
        <t>An encoder <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> insert any entry in the dynamic table it chooses; it is not
limited to field lines it is compressing.</t>
        <t>QPACK preserves the ordering of field lines within each field section.  An
encoder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> emit field representations in the order they appear in the input
field section.</t>
        <t>QPACK is designed to place the burden of optional state tracking on the encoder,
resulting in relatively simple decoders.</t>
        <section anchor="blocked-insertion">
          <name>Limits on Dynamic Table Insertions</name>
          <t>Inserting entries into the dynamic table might not be possible if the table
contains entries that cannot be evicted.</t>
          <t>A dynamic table entry cannot be evicted immediately after insertion, even if it
has never been referenced. Once the insertion of a dynamic table entry has been
acknowledged and there are no outstanding references to the entry in
unacknowledged representations, the entry becomes evictable.  Note that
references on the encoder stream never preclude the eviction of an entry,
because those references are guaranteed to be processed before the instruction
evicting the entry.</t>
          <t>If the dynamic table does not contain enough room for a new entry without
evicting other entries, and the entries that would be evicted are not
evictable, the encoder <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> insert that entry into the dynamic table
(including duplicates of existing entries). In order to avoid this, an encoder
that uses the dynamic table has to keep track of each dynamic table entry
referenced by each field section until those representations are acknowledged by
the decoder; see <xref target="header-acknowledgment"/>.</t>
          <section anchor="avoiding-prohibited-insertions">
            <name>Avoiding Prohibited Insertions</name>
            <t>To ensure that the encoder is not prevented from adding new entries, the encoder
can avoid referencing entries that are close to eviction.  Rather than
reference such an entry, the encoder can emit a Duplicate instruction
(<xref target="duplicate"/>) and reference the duplicate instead.</t>
            <t>Determining which entries are too close to eviction to reference is an encoder
preference.  One heuristic is to target a fixed amount of available space in the
dynamic table: either unused space or space that can be reclaimed by evicting
non-blocking entries.  To achieve this, the encoder can maintain a draining
index, which is the smallest absolute index (<xref target="indexing"/>) in the dynamic table
that it will emit a reference for.  As new entries are inserted, the encoder
increases the draining index to maintain the section of the table that it will
not reference.  If the encoder does not create new references to entries with an
absolute index lower than the draining index, the number of unacknowledged
references to those entries will eventually become zero, allowing them to be
evicted.</t>

        <section anchor="blocked-streams">
          <name>Blocked Streams</name>
          <t>Because QUIC does not guarantee order between data on different streams, a
decoder might encounter a representation that references a dynamic table entry
that it has not yet received.</t>
          <t>Each encoded field section contains a Required Insert Count (<xref target="header-prefix"/>),
the lowest possible value for the Insert Count with which the field section can
be decoded. For a field section encoded using references to the dynamic table,
the Required Insert Count is one larger than the largest absolute index of all
referenced dynamic table entries. For a field section encoded with no references
to the dynamic table, the Required Insert Count is zero.</t>
          <t>When the decoder receives an encoded field section with a Required Insert Count
greater than its own Insert Count, the stream cannot be processed immediately
and is considered "blocked"; see <xref target="blocked-decoding"/>.</t>
          <t>The decoder specifies an upper bound on the number of streams that can be
blocked using the SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS setting; see <xref target="configuration"/>.
An encoder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> limit the number of streams that could become blocked to the
value of SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS at all times. If a decoder encounters
more blocked streams than it promised to support, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat this as a
connection error of type QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED.</t>
          <t>Note that the decoder might not become blocked on every stream that risks
becoming blocked.</t>
          <t>An encoder can decide whether to risk having a stream become blocked. If
permitted by the value of SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS, compression efficiency
can often be improved by referencing dynamic table entries that are still in
transit, but if there is loss or reordering, the stream can become blocked at
the decoder.  An encoder can avoid the risk of blocking by only referencing
dynamic table entries that have been acknowledged, but this could mean using
literals. Since literals make the encoded field section larger, this can result
in the encoder becoming blocked on congestion or flow-control limits.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="avoiding-flow-control-deadlocks">
          <name>Avoiding Flow-Control Deadlocks</name>
          <t>Writing instructions on streams that are limited by flow control can produce
deadlocks.</t>
          <t>A decoder might stop issuing flow-control credit on the stream that carries an
encoded field section until the necessary updates are received on the encoder
stream. If the granting of flow-control credit on the encoder stream (or the
connection as a whole) depends on the consumption and release of data on the
stream carrying the encoded field section, a deadlock might result.</t>
          <t>More generally, a stream containing a large instruction can become deadlocked if
the decoder withholds flow-control credit until the instruction is completely
received.</t>
          <t>To avoid these deadlocks, an encoder <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> write an instruction unless
sufficient stream and connection flow-control credit is available for the entire
instruction.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="known-received-count">
          <name>Known Received Count</name>
          <t>The Known Received Count is the total number of dynamic table insertions and
duplications acknowledged by the decoder.  The encoder tracks the Known Received
Count in order to identify which dynamic table entries can be referenced without
potentially blocking a stream.  The decoder tracks the Known Received Count in
order to be able to send Insert Count Increment instructions.</t>
          <t>A Section Acknowledgment instruction (<xref target="header-acknowledgment"/>) implies that
the decoder has received all dynamic table state necessary to decode the field
section.  If the Required Insert Count of the acknowledged field section is
greater than the current Known Received Count, the Known Received Count is
updated to that Required Insert Count value.</t>
          <t>An Insert Count Increment instruction (<xref target="insert-count-increment"/>) increases the
Known Received Count by its Increment parameter.  See <xref target="new-table-entries"/> for
guidance.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="decoder">
        <name>Decoder</name>
        <t>As in HPACK, the decoder processes a series of representations and emits the
corresponding field sections. It also processes instructions received on the
encoder stream that modify the dynamic table.  Note that encoded field sections
and encoder stream instructions arrive on separate streams.  This is unlike
HPACK, where encoded field sections (header blocks) can contain instructions
that modify the dynamic table, and there is no dedicated stream of HPACK
instructions.</t>
        <t>The decoder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> emit field lines in the order their representations appear in
the encoded field section.</t>
        <section anchor="blocked-decoding">
          <name>Blocked Decoding</name>
          <t>Upon receipt of an encoded field section, the decoder examines the Required
Insert Count. When the Required Insert Count is less than or equal to the
decoder's Insert Count, the field section can be processed immediately.
Otherwise, the stream on which the field section was received becomes blocked.</t>
          <t>While blocked, encoded field section data <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> remain in the blocked stream's
flow-control window. This data is unusable until the stream becomes unblocked,
and releasing the flow control prematurely makes the decoder vulnerable to
memory exhaustion attacks. A stream becomes unblocked when the Insert Count
becomes greater than or equal to the Required Insert Count for all encoded
field sections the decoder has started reading from the stream.</t>
          <t>When processing encoded field sections, the decoder expects the Required Insert
Count to equal the lowest possible value for the Insert Count with which the
field section can be decoded, as prescribed in <xref target="blocked-streams"/>. If it
encounters a Required Insert Count smaller than expected, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat this as
a connection error of type QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED; see
<xref target="invalid-references"/>. If it encounters a Required Insert Count larger than
expected, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> treat this as a connection error of type
QPACK_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED.</t>

            <name>Completed Processing of a Field Section</name>
            <t>After the decoder finishes decoding a field section encoded using
representations containing dynamic table references, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> emit a Section
Acknowledgment instruction (<xref target="header-acknowledgment"/>).  A stream may carry
multiple field sections in the case of intermediate responses, trailers, and
pushed requests.  The encoder interprets each Section Acknowledgment
instruction as acknowledging the earliest unacknowledged field section
containing dynamic table references sent on the given stream.</t>

          <section anchor="abandonment-of-a-stream">
            <name>Abandonment of a Stream</name>
            <t>When an endpoint receives a stream reset before the end of a stream or before
all encoded field sections are processed on that stream, or when it abandons
reading of a stream, it generates a Stream Cancellation instruction; see
<xref target="stream-cancellation"/>.  This signals to the encoder that all references to the
dynamic table on that stream are no longer outstanding.  A decoder with a
maximum dynamic table capacity (<xref target="maximum-dynamic-table-capacity"/>) equal to
zero <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> omit sending Stream Cancellations, because the encoder cannot have any
dynamic table references.  An encoder cannot infer from this instruction that
any updates to the dynamic table have been received.</t>
            <t>The Section Acknowledgment and Stream Cancellation instructions permit the
encoder to remove references to entries in the dynamic table.  When an entry
with an absolute index lower than the Known Received Count has zero references,
then it is considered evictable; see <xref target="blocked-insertion"/>.</t>

            <name>New Table Entries</name>
            <t>After receiving new table entries on the encoder stream, the decoder chooses
when to emit Insert Count Increment instructions; see
<xref target="insert-count-increment"/>. Emitting this instruction after adding each new
dynamic table entry will provide the timeliest feedback to the encoder, but
could be redundant with other decoder feedback. By delaying an Insert Count
Increment instruction, the decoder might be able to coalesce multiple Insert
Count Increment instructions or replace them entirely with Section
Acknowledgments; see <xref target="header-acknowledgment"/>. However, delaying too long
may lead to compression inefficiencies if the encoder waits for an entry to be
acknowledged before using it.</t>

          <t>A new entry can reference an entry in the dynamic table that will be evicted
when adding this new entry into the dynamic table.  Implementations are
cautioned to avoid deleting the referenced name or value if the referenced entry
is evicted from the dynamic table prior to inserting the new entry.</t>
          <t>Whenever the dynamic table capacity is reduced by the encoder
(<xref target="set-dynamic-capacity"/>), entries are evicted from the end of the dynamic
table until the size of the dynamic table is less than or equal to the new table
capacity.  This mechanism can be used to completely clear entries from the
dynamic table by setting a capacity of 0, which can subsequently be restored.</t>

value the encoder is permitted to set for the dynamic table capacity.  In
HTTP/3, this limit is determined by the value of
SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY sent by the decoder; see <xref target="configuration"/>.
The encoder <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> set a dynamic table capacity that exceeds this maximum, but
it can choose to use a lower dynamic table capacity; see
<xref target="set-dynamic-capacity"/>.</t>
          <t>For clients using 0-RTT data in HTTP/3, the server's maximum table capacity is
the remembered value of the setting or zero if the value was not previously

it to a non-zero value in its SETTINGS frame. If the remembered value is
non-zero, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send the same non-zero value in its SETTINGS frame. If
it specifies any other value, or omits SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY from

            <t>The Base is used to resolve references in the dynamic table as described in
<xref target="relative-indexing"/>.</t>
            <t>To save space, the Base is encoded relative to the Required Insert Count using a
one-bit Sign ('S' in <xref target="fig-base-index"/>) and the Delta Base value.  A Sign bit
of 0 indicates that the Base is greater than or equal to the value of the
Required Insert Count; the decoder adds the value of Delta Base to the Required
Insert Count to determine the value of the Base.  A Sign bit of 1 indicates that
the Base is less than the Required Insert Count; the decoder subtracts the value
of Delta Base from the Required Insert Count and also subtracts one to determine
the value of the Base. That is:</t>
            <sourcecode type="pseudocode"><![CDATA[
   if Sign == 0:
      Base = ReqInsertCount + DeltaBase
   else:
      Base = ReqInsertCount - DeltaBase - 1
]]></sourcecode>
            <t>A single-pass encoder determines the Base before encoding a field section.  If
the encoder inserted entries in the dynamic table while encoding the field
section and is referencing them, Required Insert Count will be greater than the
Base, so the encoded difference is negative and the Sign bit is set to 1.  If
the field section was not encoded using representations that reference the most
recent entry in the table and did not insert any new entries, the Base will be
greater than the Required Insert Count, so the encoded difference will be
positive and the Sign bit is set to 0.</t>
            <t>The value of Base <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be negative. Though the protocol might operate
correctly with a negative Base using post-Base indexing, it is unnecessary and
inefficient. An endpoint <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat a field block with a Sign bit of 1 as
invalid if the value of Required Insert Count is less than or equal to the value
of Delta Base.</t>
            <t>An encoder that produces table updates before encoding a field section might set
Base to the value of Required Insert Count.  In such a case, both the Sign bit
and the Delta Base will be set to zero.</t>
            <t>A field section that was encoded without references to the dynamic table can use
any value for the Base; setting Delta Base to zero is one of the most efficient
encodings.</t>
            <t>For example, with a Required Insert Count of 9, a decoder receives a Sign bit
of 1 and a Delta Base of 2.  This sets the Base to 6 and enables post-Base
indexing for three entries.  In this example, a relative index of 1 refers to
the fifth entry that was added to the table; a post-Base index of 1 refers to
the eighth entry.</t>

        <li>Use of compression as a length-based oracle for verifying guesses about
secrets that are compressed into a shared compression context.</li>
        <li>Denial of service resulting from exhausting processing or memory capacity at

      </ul>
      <section anchor="probing-dynamic-table-state">
        <name>Probing Dynamic Table State</name>
        <t>QPACK reduces the encoded size of field sections by exploiting the redundancy
inherent in protocols like HTTP. The ultimate goal of this is to reduce the
amount of data that is required to send HTTP requests or responses.</t>
        <t>The compression context used to encode header and trailer fields can be probed
by an attacker who can both define fields to be encoded and transmitted and
observe the length of those fields once they are encoded. When an attacker can
do both, they can adaptively modify requests in order to confirm guesses about
the dynamic table state. If a guess is compressed into a shorter length, the
attacker can observe the encoded length and infer that the guess was correct.</t>
        <t>This is possible even over the Transport Layer Security Protocol
(<xref target="TLS"/>) and the QUIC Transport Protocol (<xref target="QUIC-TRANSPORT"/>), because
while TLS and QUIC provide confidentiality protection for content, they only
provide a limited amount of protection for the length of that content.</t>
        <aside>
          <t>Note: Padding schemes only provide limited protection against an attacker with
these capabilities, potentially only forcing an increased number of guesses to
learn the length associated with a given guess. Padding schemes also work
directly against compression by increasing the number of bits that are
transmitted.</t>
        </aside>
        <t>Attacks like CRIME (<xref target="CRIME"/>) demonstrated the existence of these general
attacker capabilities. The specific attack exploited the fact that DEFLATE
(<xref target="RFC1951"/>) removes redundancy based on prefix matching. This permitted the
attacker to confirm guesses a character at a time, reducing an exponential-time
attack into a linear-time attack.</t>
        <section anchor="applicability-to-qpack-and-http">
          <name>Applicability to QPACK and HTTP</name>
          <t>QPACK mitigates, but does not completely prevent, attacks modeled on CRIME
(<xref target="CRIME"/>) by forcing a guess to match an entire field line rather than
individual characters. An attacker can only learn whether a guess is correct or
not, so the attacker is reduced to a brute-force guess for the field values
associated with a given field name.</t>
          <t>Therefore, the viability of recovering specific field values depends on the
entropy of values. As a result, values with high entropy are unlikely to be
recovered successfully. However, values with low entropy remain vulnerable.</t>
          <t>Attacks of this nature are possible any time that two mutually distrustful
entities control requests or responses that are placed onto a single HTTP/3
connection. If the shared QPACK compressor permits one entity to add entries to
the dynamic table, and the other to refer to those entries while encoding
chosen field lines, then the attacker (the second entity) can learn the state
of the table by observing the length of the encoded output.</t>
          <t>For example, requests or responses from mutually distrustful entities can occur
when an intermediary either:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>sends requests from multiple clients on a single connection toward an origin
server, or</li>
            <li>takes responses from multiple origin servers and places them on a shared
connection toward a client.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>Web browsers also need to assume that requests made on the same connection by
different web origins (<xref target="RFC6454"/>) are made by mutually distrustful entities.
Other scenarios involving mutually distrustful entities are also possible.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="mitigation">
          <name>Mitigation</name>
          <t>Users of HTTP that require confidentiality for header or trailer fields can use
values with entropy sufficient to make guessing infeasible. However, this is
impractical as a general solution because it forces all users of HTTP to take
steps to mitigate attacks. It would impose new constraints on how HTTP is used.</t>
          <t>Rather than impose constraints on users of HTTP, an implementation of QPACK can
instead constrain how compression is applied in order to limit the potential for
dynamic table probing.</t>
          <t>An ideal solution segregates access to the dynamic table based on the entity
that is constructing the message. Field values that are added to the table are
attributed to an entity, and only the entity that created a particular value can
extract that value.</t>
          <t>To improve compression performance of this option, certain entries might be
tagged as being public. For example, a web browser might make the values of the
Accept-Encoding header field available in all requests.</t>
          <t>An encoder without good knowledge of the provenance of field values might
instead introduce a penalty for many field lines with the same field name and
different values.  This penalty could cause a large number of attempts to guess
a field value to result in the field not being compared to the dynamic table
entries in future messages, effectively preventing further guesses.</t>
          <t>This response might be made inversely proportional to the length of the
field value. Disabling access to the dynamic table for a given field name might
occur for shorter values more quickly or with higher probability than for longer
values.</t>
          <t>This mitigation is most effective between two endpoints. If messages are
re-encoded by an intermediary without knowledge of which entity constructed a
given message, the intermediary could inadvertently merge compression contexts
that the original encoder had specifically kept separate.</t>
          <aside>
            <t>Note: Simply removing entries corresponding to the field from the dynamic table
can be ineffectual if the attacker has a reliable way of causing values to be
reinstalled. For example, a request to load an image in a web browser typically
includes the Cookie header field (a potentially highly valued target for this
sort of attack), and websites can easily force an image to be loaded, thereby
refreshing the entry in the dynamic table.</t>

        <section anchor="never-indexed-literals">
          <name>Never-Indexed Literals</name>
          <t>Implementations can also choose to protect sensitive fields by not compressing
them and instead encoding their value as literals.</t>
          <t>Refusing to insert a field line into the dynamic table is only effective if
doing so is avoided on all hops. The never-indexed literal bit (see
<xref target="literal-name-reference"/>) can be used to signal to intermediaries that a
particular value was intentionally sent as a literal.</t>
          <t>An intermediary <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> re-encode a value that uses a literal representation
with the 'N' bit set with another representation that would index it. If QPACK
is used for re-encoding, a literal representation with the 'N' bit set <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
used.  If HPACK is used for re-encoding, the never-indexed literal
representation (see <xref section="6.2.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7541"/>) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used.</t>
          <t>The choice to mark that a field value should never be indexed depends on several
factors. Since QPACK does not protect against guessing an entire field value,
short or low-entropy values are more readily recovered by an adversary.
Therefore, an encoder might choose not to index values with low entropy.</t>
          <t>An encoder might also choose not to index values for fields that are considered
to be highly valuable or sensitive to recovery, such as the Cookie or
Authorization header fields.</t>
          <t>On the contrary, an encoder might prefer indexing values for fields that have
little or no value if they were exposed. For instance, a User-Agent header field
does not commonly vary between requests and is sent to any server. In that case,
confirmation that a particular User-Agent value has been used provides little
value.</t>
          <t>Note that these criteria for deciding to use a never-indexed literal
representation will evolve over time as new attacks are discovered.</t>

      <section anchor="memory-consumption">
        <name>Memory Consumption</name>
        <t>An attacker can try to cause an endpoint to exhaust its memory. QPACK is
designed to limit both the peak and stable amounts of memory allocated by an
endpoint.</t>
        <t>QPACK uses the definition of the maximum size of the dynamic table and the
maximum number of blocking streams to limit the amount of memory the encoder can
cause the decoder to consume. In HTTP/3, these values are controlled by the
decoder through the settings parameters SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY and
SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS, respectively (see
<xref target="maximum-dynamic-table-capacity"/> and <xref target="blocked-streams"/>). The limit on the
size of the dynamic table takes into account the size of the data stored in the
dynamic table, plus a small allowance for overhead.  The limit on the number of
blocked streams is only a proxy for the maximum amount of memory required by the
decoder.  The actual maximum amount of memory will depend on how much memory the
decoder uses to track each blocked stream.</t>
        <t>A decoder can limit the amount of state memory used for the dynamic table by
setting an appropriate value for the maximum size of the dynamic table. In
HTTP/3, this is realized by setting an appropriate value for the
SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY parameter. An encoder can limit the amount of
state memory it uses by choosing a smaller dynamic table size than the decoder
allows and signaling this to the decoder (see <xref target="set-dynamic-capacity"/>).</t>
        <t>A decoder can limit the amount of state memory used for blocked streams by
setting an appropriate value for the maximum number of blocked streams.  In
HTTP/3, this is realized by setting an appropriate value for the
SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS parameter.  Streams that risk becoming blocked
consume no additional state memory on the encoder.</t>
        <t>An encoder allocates memory to track all dynamic table references in
unacknowledged field sections.  An implementation can directly limit the amount
of state memory by only using as many references to the dynamic table as it
wishes to track; no signaling to the decoder is required.  However, limiting
references to the dynamic table will reduce compression effectiveness.</t>
        <t>The amount of temporary memory consumed by an encoder or decoder can be limited
by processing field lines sequentially. A decoder implementation does not need
to retain a complete list of field lines while decoding a field section. An
encoder implementation does not need to retain a complete list of field lines
while encoding a field section if it is using a single-pass algorithm.  Note
that it might be necessary for an application to retain a complete list of field
lines for other reasons; even if QPACK does not force this to occur, application
constraints might make this necessary.</t>
        <t>While the negotiated limit on the dynamic table size accounts for much of the
memory that can be consumed by a QPACK implementation, data that cannot be
immediately sent due to flow control is not affected by this limit.
Implementations should limit the size of unsent data, especially on the decoder
stream where flexibility to choose what to send is limited.  Possible responses
to an excess of unsent data might include limiting the ability of the peer to
open new streams, reading only from the encoder stream, or closing the
connection.</t>

        <t>An implementation has to set a limit for the values it accepts for integers, as
well as for the encoded length; see <xref target="prefixed-integers"/>. In the same way, it
has to set a limit to the length it accepts for string literals; see

              <t>This document defines the concept of an "origin", which is often used as the scope of authority or privilege by user agents.  Typically, user agents isolate content retrieved from different origins to prevent malicious web site operators from interfering with the operation of benign web sites.  In addition to outlining the principles that underlie the concept of origin, this document details how to determine the origin of a URI and how to serialize an origin into a string.  It also defines an HTTP header field, named "Origin", that indicates which origins are associated with an HTTP request.   [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

      <t>The following examples represent a series of exchanges between an encoder and a
decoder.  The exchanges are designed to exercise most QPACK instructions and
highlight potentially common patterns and their impact on dynamic table state.
The encoder sends three encoded field sections containing one field line each,
as well as two speculative inserts that are not referenced.</t>
      <t>The state of the encoder's dynamic table is shown, along with its
current size.  Each entry is shown with the Absolute Index of the entry (Abs),
the current number of outstanding encoded field sections with references to that
entry (Ref), along with the name and value.  Entries above the 'acknowledged'
line have been acknowledged by the decoder.</t>
