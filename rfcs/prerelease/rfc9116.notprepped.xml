    <abstract>
      <t>When security vulnerabilities are discovered by
researchers, proper reporting channels are often lacking. As a result,
vulnerabilities may be left unreported. This document defines a machine-parsable format
("security.txt") to help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices
to make it easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.</t>

        <name>Motivation, Prior Work, and Scope</name>
        <t>Many security researchers encounter situations where they are unable
to report security vulnerabilities to organizations because there are
no reporting channels to contact the owner of a particular
resource, and no information is available about the vulnerability disclosure practices
of such owner.</t>
        <t>As per <xref target="RFC2142" section="4" sectionFormat="of"/>, there is an existing convention
of using the &lt;SECURITY@domain&gt; email address for communications regarding
security issues. That convention provides only a single, email-based
channel of communication per domain and does not provide
a way for domain owners to publish information about their security disclosure
practices.</t>
        <t>There are also contact conventions prescribed for Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
in <xref target="RFC3013" section="2" sectionFormat="of"/>, for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)
in <xref target="RFC2350" section="3.2" sectionFormat="of"/>, and for site operators in <xref target="RFC2196" section="5.2" sectionFormat="of"/>. As per <xref target="RFC7485" format="default"/>, there is also contact information provided by
Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and domain registries for owners of IP
addresses, Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), and domain names. However, none of
these tackle the issue of how security researchers can locate contact information
and vulnerability disclosure practices for organizations in order to report
vulnerabilities.</t>
        <t>In this document, we define a richer, machine-parsable, and more extensible way
for organizations to communicate information about their security disclosure
practices and ways to contact them. Other details of vulnerability disclosure
are outside the scope of this document. Readers are encouraged to consult other
documents such as <xref target="ISO.29147.2018" format="default"/> or <xref target="CERT.CVD" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>As per <xref target="CERT.CVD" format="default"/>, "vulnerability response" refers to reports of product vulnerabilities,
which is related to but distinct from reports of network intrusions and compromised
websites ("incident response"). The mechanism defined in this document is intended
to be used for the former ("vulnerability response"). If implementors want
to utilize this mechanism for incident response, they should be aware of additional
security considerations discussed in <xref target="compromise" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The "security.txt" file is intended to be complementary and not a substitute
or replacement for other public resources maintained by organizations regarding
their security disclosure practices.</t>

      <name>The Specification</name>
      <t>This document defines a text file to be placed in a known location
that provides information about vulnerability disclosure practices of a particular organization.
The format of this file is machine parsable and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> follow the ABNF grammar defined in
<xref target="abnf" format="default"/>. This file is intended to help security researchers when
disclosing security vulnerabilities.</t>
      <t>By convention, the file is named "security.txt". The location and scope are described
in <xref target="location" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>This text file contains multiple fields with different values. A field contains a "name", which is the first part of a field all the way up
to the colon (for example: "Contact:") and follows the syntax defined for "field-name" in <xref target="RFC5322" section="3.6.8" sectionFormat="of"/>. Field names are case insensitive (as per <xref target="RFC5234" section="2.3" sectionFormat="of"/>).
The "value" comes after the field name (for example: "mailto:security@example.com") and follows the syntax
defined for "unstructured" in <xref target="RFC5322" section="3.2.5" sectionFormat="of"/>. The file <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also contain blank lines.</t>
      <t>A field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always consist of a name and a value
(for example: "Contact: mailto:security@example.com"). A "security.txt" file
can have an unlimited number of fields. Each field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> appear on
its own line. Unless otherwise specified by the field definition,
multiple values <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be chained together for a single field.
Unless otherwise indicated in a definition of a particular field, a field <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> appear
multiple times.</t>
      <t>Implementors should be aware that some of the fields may
contain URIs using percent-encoding (as per <xref target="RFC3986" section="2.1" sectionFormat="of"/>).</t>
      <section anchor="comments" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Comments</name>
        <t>Any line beginning with the "#" (%x23) symbol <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be interpreted as a comment. The content of the comment may contain any ASCII or Unicode characters in the
	%x21-7E and %x80-FFFFF ranges plus the tab (%x09) and space (%x20) characters.</t>

        <name>Digital Signature</name>
        <t>It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that a "security.txt" file be digitally signed
using an OpenPGP cleartext signature as described in <xref target="RFC4880" section="7" sectionFormat="of"/>. When digital signatures are used, it is also
<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that organizations use the "Canonical" field (as per <xref target="canonical" format="default"/>),
thus allowing the digital signature to authenticate the location of the file.</t>
        <t>When it comes to verifying the key used to generate the signature, it is always
the security researcher's responsibility to make sure the key being
used is indeed one they trust.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="extensibility" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Extensibility</name>
        <t>Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be changed
over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the Internet. Therefore,
extensibility is provided via an IANA registry for fields as defined
in <xref target="registry" format="default"/>. Any fields registered via that process <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
considered optional. To encourage extensibility and interoperability,
researchers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore any fields they do not explicitly support.</t>
        <t>In general, implementors should "be conservative in what you do,
be liberal in what you accept from others" (as per <xref target="RFC0793" format="default"/>).</t>

          <t>The "Acknowledgments" field indicates a link to a page where security
researchers are recognized for their reports. The page being referenced
should list security researchers that reported security vulnerabilities
and collaborated to remediate them. Organizations should be careful
to limit the vulnerability information being published in order
to prevent future attacks.</t>
          <t>If this field indicates a web URI, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> begin with "https://"
(as per <xref target="RFC7230" section="2.7.2" sectionFormat="of"/>).</t>

          <t>The "Contact" field indicates a method that researchers
should use for reporting security
vulnerabilities such as an email address, a phone number, and/or a
web page with contact information. This field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
always be present in a "security.txt" file. If this field indicates a web URI,
then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> begin with "https://" (as per <xref target="RFC7230" section="2.7.2" sectionFormat="of"/>).

          <t>The value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> follow the URI syntax described in <xref target="RFC3986" section="3" sectionFormat="of"/>.
This means that "mailto" and "tel" URI schemes must be used
when specifying email addresses and telephone numbers, as defined in <xref target="RFC6068" format="default"/>

      <t>"ext-field" refers to extension fields, which are discussed in <xref target="extensibility" format="default"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Because of the use of URIs and well-known resources, security considerations of
<xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8615" format="default"/> apply here, in addition to the
considerations outlined below.</t>
      <section anchor="compromise" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Compromised Files and Incident Response</name>
        <t>An attacker that has compromised a website is able to compromise
the "security.txt" file as well or set up a redirect to their own site.
This can result in security reports not being received by the organization
or being sent to the attacker.</t>
        <t>To protect against this, organizations should use the "Canonical" field to indicate the locations
of the file (as per <xref target="canonical" format="default"/>), digitally sign their "security.txt"
files (as per <xref target="signature" format="default"/>), and regularly monitor the file and
the referenced resources to detect tampering.</t>

<t>Security researchers should validate the "security.txt" file, including verifying
the digital signature and checking any available historical records before using the information
contained in the file. If the "security.txt" file looks suspicious or compromised,
it should not be used.</t>
        <t>While it is not recommended, implementors may choose to use the information published
within a "security.txt" file for an incident response. In such cases, extreme caution
should be taken before trusting such information, since
it may have been compromised by an attacker. Researchers should use additional methods
to verify such data including out-of-band verification of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) signature, DNSSEC-based approaches, etc.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="redirects" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Redirects</name>
        <t>When retrieving the file and any resources referenced in the file, researchers should record
any redirects since they can lead to a different domain or IP address controlled by an attacker. Further
inspection of such redirects is recommended before using the information contained within the file.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="stale" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Incorrect or Stale Information</name>
        <t>If information and resources referenced in a "security.txt" file are incorrect
or not kept up to date, this can result in security reports not being received
by the organization or sent to incorrect contacts, thus exposing possible
security issues to third parties. Not having a "security.txt" file may be preferable
to having stale information in this file. Organizations must use
the "Expires" field (see <xref target="expires" format="default"/>) to indicate to researchers when
the data in the file is no longer valid.</t>
        <t>Organizations should ensure that information in this file and any referenced
resources such as web pages, email addresses, and telephone numbers
are kept current, are accessible, are controlled by the organization,
and are kept secure.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="intentionally-malformed-files-resources-and-reports" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intentionally Malformed Files, Resources, and Reports</name>
        <t>It is possible for compromised or malicious sites to create files that are extraordinarily
large or otherwise malformed in an attempt to discover or exploit weaknesses
in the parsing code. 

Researchers should make sure that any such code
is robust against large or malformed files and fields, and they may choose to have the code not parse files larger than 32 KBs, those with fields longer than 2,048 characters, or those containing more than 1,000 lines. The ABNF grammar (as defined in
<xref target="abnf" format="default"/>) can also be used as a way to verify these files.</t>
        <t>The same concerns apply to any other resources referenced within "security.txt"
files, as well as any security reports received as a result of publishing
this file. Such resources and reports may be hostile, malformed, or malicious.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="no-implied-permission-for-testing" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>No Implied Permission for Testing</name>
        <t>The presence of a "security.txt" file might be interpreted by researchers
as providing permission to do security testing against the domain or IP address
where it is published or against products and services provided by the organization publishing
the file.
This might result in increased testing against an organization by researchers. On the other hand, a decision not
to publish a "security.txt" file might be interpreted by the
organization operating that website to be a way to signal to researchers
that permission to test that particular site or project is denied. This might result in pushback against
researchers reporting security issues to that organization.</t>
        <t>Therefore, researchers shouldn't assume that the presence or absence of
a "security.txt" file grants or denies permission for security testing.
Any such permission may be indicated in the company's vulnerability disclosure policy
(as per <xref target="policy" format="default"/>) or a new field (as per <xref target="extensibility" format="default"/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="multi-user-environments" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Multi-User Environments</name>
        <t>In multi-user / multi-tenant environments, it may be possible for a user to take
over the location of the "security.txt" file. Organizations should reserve
the "security.txt" namespace at the root to ensure no third party can create a page with
the "security.txt" AND "/.well-known/security.txt" names.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="protecting-data-in-transit" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Protecting Data in Transit</name>
        <t>To protect a "security.txt" file from being tampered with in transit, implementors <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use
HTTPS (as per <xref target="RFC7230" section="2.7.2" sectionFormat="of"/>) when serving the file itself and for retrieval of any web URIs
referenced in it (except when otherwise noted in this specification). As part of the TLS
handshake, researchers should validate the provided X.509 certificate
in accordance with <xref target="RFC6125" format="default"/> and the following considerations:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Matching is performed only against the DNS-ID identifiers.</li>
          <li>DNS domain names in server certificates <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain the wildcard
character '*' as the complete leftmost label within the identifier.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The certificate may also be checked for revocation via the Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) <xref target="RFC6960" format="default"/>, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), or similar mechanisms.</t>
        <t>In cases where the "security.txt" file cannot be served via HTTPS (such as localhost) or is
being served with an invalid certificate, additional human validation is recommended since
the contents may have been modified while in transit.</t>
        <t>As an additional layer of protection, it is also recommended that
organizations digitally sign their "security.txt" file with OpenPGP (as per <xref target="signature" format="default"/>).
Also, to protect security reports from being tampered with or observed while in transit,
organizations should specify encryption keys (as per <xref target="encryption" format="default"/>) unless
HTTPS is being used for report submission.</t>
        <t>However, the determination of validity of such keys is out of scope
for this specification. Security researchers need to establish other secure means to
verify them.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="spam-and-spurious-reports" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Spam and Spurious Reports</name>
        <t>Similar to concerns in <xref target="RFC2142" format="default"/>, denial-of-service attacks via spam reports
would become easier once a "security.txt" file is published by
an organization. In addition, there is an increased likelihood of reports
being sent in an automated fashion and/or as a result of automated scans without
human analysis. Attackers can also use this file as a way to spam unrelated
third parties by listing their resources and/or contact information.</t>
        <t>Organizations need to weigh the advantages of publishing this file versus
the possible disadvantages and increased resources required to analyze
	security reports.</t>

        <t>Security researchers should review all information within the "security.txt"
file before submitting reports in an automated fashion or reports resulting from automated scans.</t>
