    <abstract>
      <t>This document deprecates the use of any "int" domain names that were
designated for infrastructure purposes by the IETF, and it identifies
them for removal from the "int" top-level domain.  Any implementations
that involve these domains are now deprecated.  This
document also changes the status of RFC 1528 and RFC 1706 to
Historic.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The "int" top-level domain <xref target="RFC1591" format="default"/> is a specialized domain
designated for intergovernmental organizations, which are organizations
established by international treaties between or among national
governments.</t>
      <t>Historically, the "int" domain was also used for purposes related to Internet infrastructure. This practice ended in 2001 when the "arpa" domain was
declared the appropriate home for infrastructural identifier spaces
<xref target="RFC3172" format="default"/>. In conjunction with this change, the eligibility for "int"
domains was limited to only intergovernmental treaty organizations.</t>
      <t>The documented uses of infrastructural identifiers in the "int" domain
were largely experimental and are now, in practice, obsolete. This document
changes the status of related specifications to Historic, and it 
removes any associated delegations from the "int" zone in the
domain name system.</t>

      <name>Historical Infrastructural Uses</name>
      <t>The following domains were used for infrastructural identifier purposes
that are now considered historic. Although each of these names was
either delegated or documented at one time, the parties administering
them have long since stopped using them.</t>
      <section anchor="atmaint" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>atma.int</name>
        <t>The atma.int domain was experimentally defined to implement address
lookups for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), including ATM End System
Addresses (AESAs) <xref target="ANS" format="default"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ip4int" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ip4.int</name>
        <t>The ip4.int domain was described as providing an alternative to the
in-addr.arpa domain for mapping host IPv4 addresses to host names. The
in-addr.arpa domain zone continues to be administered for this purpose
<xref target="RFC1035" format="default"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ip6int" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>ip6.int</name>
        <t>The ip6.int domain was originally delegated for mapping host IPv6 addresses
to host names. It was subsequently removed from the "int" zone, having
been replaced by ip6.arpa <xref target="RFC4159" format="default"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="nsapint" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>nsap.int</name>
        <t>The nsap.int domain name was specified to experimentally map Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) Network Service Access Points to domain
names <xref target="RFC1706" format="default"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="rdiint" numbered="true" toc="default">

        <t>The rdi.int domain name experimentally mapped OSI Inter-Domain Routing
Protocol's Routing Domain Identifiers <xref target="ISO10747" format="default"/> to the domain name
system.</t>

      <section anchor="regint" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>reg.int</name>
        <t>The reg.int domain name hosted an experimental mechanism for publishing
IANA registration values in the domain name system.</t>

        <name>tpc.int</name>
        <t>The tpc.int domain name hosted an experimental remote printing
service that served as a gateway between Internet mail and facsimile
transmission <xref target="RFC1528" format="default"/>.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Some old systems might have one or more subdomains of these names
hardwired and expect a positive response for at least the second-level
domain. This is, of course, true for any name in the DNS and should not
be the sole basis for retaining obsolete names.</t>

      <t>Existing applications should eliminate any reliance upon these
zones. The operator of the "int" domain
should be cautious about any potential re-use of these domains for
intergovernmental treaty organizations.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="additional-information" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Additional Information</name>
      <t>This document is the result of a comprehensive inventory of .int domains 
to accurately establish and record their
purpose based on historical documentation. As part of this inventory,
IANA studied the domains delegated for purposes related to infrastructure identifiers. Query patterns in the DNS for these domains were analyzed
and judged to be insignificant; preliminary outreach 
to the contacts for the associated domains was conducted. The assessment concluded
that these domains are very likely obsolete. This document formalizes that assessment.</t>

      <t>There are a small number of nominal "int" domains for
"international databases" that are not defined by any standards
documentation. They are assigned to entities rather than for
identifier purposes. Their dispositions are beyond the scope of this
memo.
