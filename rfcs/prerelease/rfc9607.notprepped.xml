    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the RTP payload format of the Secure
      Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP). SCIP is an
      application-layer protocol that provides end-to-end session
      establishment, payload encryption, packetization and de-packetization of
      media, and reliable transport.  This document provides a globally
      available reference that can be used for the development of network
      equipment and procurement of services that support SCIP traffic. The
      intended audience is network security policymakers; network
      administrators, architects, and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs);
      procurement personnel; and government agency and commercial industry
      representatives.</t>

    <note>
      <name>IESG Note</name>
      <t>This IETF specification depends upon a second technical specification
      that is not available publicly, namely <xref target="SCIP210"/>.
	  The IETF was therefore unable to conduct a security review of that
      specification, independently or when carried inside Audio/Video
      Transport (AVT). Implementers need to be aware that the IETF hence
      cannot verify any of the security claims contained in this document.</t>

      <ul>
        <li>SCIP is an application-layer protocol that uses RTP as a transport.  This document defines
 the SCIP media subtypes to be listed in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) and only requires
 a basic RTP transport channel for SCIP payloads. This basic transport channel is comparable to
 Clearmode as defined by <xref target="RFC4040"/>.</li>
        <li>SCIP transmits encrypted traffic and does not require the use of Secure RTP
 (SRTP) for payload protection.  SCIP also provides for reliable transport at
 the application layer, so it is not necessary to negotiate RTCP retransmission capabilities.</li>
        <li>SCIP includes built-in mechanisms that negotiate protocol message versions and capabilities.
 To avoid SCIP protocol ossification (as described in <xref target="RFC9170"/>), it is important
 for middleboxes to not attempt parsing of the SCIP payload. As described in this document,
 such parsing serves no useful purpose.</li>
        <li>SCIP is designed to be network agnostic. It can operate over any digital link, including
 non-IP modem-based PSTN and ISDN. The SCIP media subtypes listed in this document were
 developed for SCIP to operate over RTP.</li>
        <li>SCIP handles packetization and de-packetization of payloads by producing encrypted media packets
 that are not greater than the MTU size. The SCIP payload is opaque to the network, therefore, SCIP functions
 as a tunneling protocol for the encrypted media, without the need for middleboxes to parse SCIP payloads.
 Since SCIP payloads are integrity protected, modification of the SCIP payload is detected as an
 integrity violation by SCIP endpoints, leading to communication failure.</li>

      <t>This document details usage of the "audio/scip" and "video/scip"
      pseudo-codecs <xref target="MediaTypes"/> as a secure session establishment protocol and media
      transport protocol over RTP.</t>
	  <t>It discusses how:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal">
	<li>encrypted audio and video codec payloads are transported over RTP;</li>
	<li>the IP network layer does not implement SCIP as a protocol since
    SCIP operates at the application layer in endpoints;</li>
	<li>the IP network layer enables SCIP traffic to transparently pass
       through the network;</li>
	<li>some network devices do not recognize SCIP and may remove the SCIP
       codecs from the SDP media payload declaration before forwarding
       to the next network node; and finally,</li>
	<li>SCIP endpoint devices do not operate on networks if the SCIP
       media subtype is removed from the SDP media payload declaration.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>The United States, along with its NATO Partners, have implemented SCIP in secure voice, video, and
 data products operating on commercial, private, and tactical IP networks
 worldwide using the scip media subtype. The SCIP data traversing the network is encrypted,
 and network equipment in-line with the session cannot interpret the traffic stream in any way.
 SCIP-based RTP traffic is opaque and can vary significantly in structure and frequency, making
 traffic profiling not possible.  Also, as the SCIP protocol continues to evolve independently
 of this document, any network device that attempts to filter traffic (e.g., deep packet inspection)
 may cause unintended consequences in the future when changes to the SCIP traffic may not be recognized by
 the network device.
</t>
      <t>The SCIP protocol defined in SCIP-210 <xref target="SCIP210"/> includes built-in
 support for packetization and de-packetization, retransmission,
 capability exchange, version negotiation, and payload encryption. Since the traffic is encrypted,
 neither the RTP transport nor middleboxes can usefully parse or modify SCIP
 payloads; modifications are detected as integrity violations resulting in
 retransmission, and eventually, communication failure.</t>
      <t>Because knowledge of the SCIP payload format is not needed to transport SCIP signaling or
 media through middleboxes, SCIP-210 represents an informative reference. While older versions
 of the SCIP-210 specification are publicly available, the authors strongly encourage
 network implementers to treat SCIP payloads as opaque octets. When handled correctly, such
 treatment does not require referring to SCIP-210, and any assumptions about the format of
 SCIP messages defined in SCIP-210 are likely to lead to protocol ossification and
 communication failures as the protocol evolves.</t>

<t>The Secure Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP)
   allows the negotiation of several voice, data, and video
   applications using various cryptographic suites. SCIP also provides several
   important characteristics that have led to its broad acceptance as a secure
   communications protocol.</t>
      <t>SCIP began in the United States as the Future Narrowband Digital
   Terminal (FNBDT) Protocol in the late 1990s.  A combined U.S. Department of Defense
   and vendor consortium formed a governing organization named the
   Interoperability Control Working Group (ICWG) to manage the
   protocol.  In time, the group expanded to include NATO, NATO
   partners, and European vendors under the name International
   Interoperability Control Working Group (IICWG), which was later
   renamed the SCIP Working Group.</t>
      <t>First generation SCIP devices operated on circuit-switched
   networks.  SCIP was then expanded to radio and IP networks.
   The scip media subtype transports SCIP secure session
   establishment signaling and secure application traffic.  The
   built-in negotiation and flexibility provided by the SCIP
   protocols make it a natural choice for many scenarios that
   require various secure applications and associated encryption
   suites.  SCIP has been adopted by NATO in STANAG 5068.
   SCIP standards are currently available to participating
   government and military communities and select OEMs of equipment
   that support SCIP.</t>
      <t>However, SCIP must operate over global networks (including
   private and commercial networks).  Without access to necessary
   information to support SCIP, some networks may not support the
   SCIP media subtypes.  Issues may occur simply because
   information is not as readily available to OEMs, network
   administrators, and network architects.</t>
      <t>This document provides essential information about the "audio/scip" and
   "video/scip" media subtypes that enable network equipment
   manufacturers to include settings for "scip" as a known audio and video media
   subtype in their equipment. This enables network administrators
   to define and implement a compatible security policy that includes audio and
   video media subtypes "audio/scip" and "video/scip", respectively, as permitted
   codecs on the network.</t>
      <t>All current IP-based SCIP endpoints implement "scip" as a media
   subtype.  Registration of scip as a media subtype provides a
   common reference for network equipment manufacturers to
   recognize SCIP in an SDP payload declaration.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="media-format-description">
      <name>Payload Format</name>
      <!-- section 4 -->

      <t>The "scip" media subtype identifies and indicates support for SCIP
      traffic that is being transported over RTP.  Transcoding, lossy
      compression, or other data modifications <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
      performed by the network on the SCIP RTP payload.  The "audio/scip" and
      "video/scip" media subtype data streams within the network, including the
      VoIP network, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a transparent relay and be treated
      as "clear-channel data", similar to the Clearmode media subtype defined
      by <xref target="RFC4040"/>.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC4040"/> is referenced because Clearmode does not define
   specific RTP payload content, packet size, or packet intervals, but rather
   enables Clearmode devices to signal that they support a compatible mode of
   operation and defines a transparent channel on which devices may communicate.
   This document takes a similar approach. Network devices that implement support for
   SCIP need to enable SCIP endpoints to signal that they support SCIP and
   provide a transparent channel on which SCIP endpoints may communicate.
</t>
      <t>SCIP is an application-layer protocol that is defined in SCIP-210.
The SCIP traffic consists of encrypted SCIP control messages
and codec data. The payload size and interval will vary considerably depending on
the state of the SCIP protocol within the SCIP device.</t>

      <t>The SCIP codec produces an encrypted bitstream that is transported over RTP. Unlike other
codecs, SCIP does not have its own upper layer syntax (e.g., no Network Adaptation Layer (NAL)
units), but rather encrypts the output of the audio and video codecs that it uses
(e.g., G.729D, H.264 <xref target="RFC6184"/>, etc.).
SCIP achieves this by encapsulating the encrypted codec output that has been previously formatted
according to the relevant RTP payload specification for that codec. SCIP endpoints <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> employ
mechanisms, such as inter-media RTP synchronization as described in <xref target="RFC8088" sectionFormat="comma" section="3.3.4"/>, to
synchronize "audio/scip" and "video/scip" streams.</t>

        <name>Mapping to SDP</name>
        <!-- section 5.3 -->

<t>The mapping of the above-defined payload format media subtype
   and its parameters <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be implemented according to <xref target="RFC4855" sectionFormat="of" section="3"/>.</t>
        <t>Since SCIP includes its own facilities for capabilities exchange,
it is only necessary to negotiate the use of SCIP within SDP Offer/Answer;
the specific codecs to be encapsulated within SCIP are then negotiated via
the exchange of SCIP control messages.</t>
        <t>The information carried in the media type specification has a
specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
<xref target="RFC8866"/>, which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.
When SDP is used to specify sessions employing the SCIP codec, the mapping
is as follows:</t>
        <ul>
          <li>The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name for "audio/scip",
and the media type ("video") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name for "video/scip".</li>
          <li>The media subtype ("scip") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding name.
The required parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as the clock rate.</li>
          <li>The optional parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
"a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>An example mapping for "audio/scip" is:</t>
        <sourcecode type="sdp">
  m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 96
  a=rtpmap:96 scip/8000
  </sourcecode>

        <t>An example mapping for "video/scip" is:</t>
        <sourcecode type="sdp">
  m=video 50002 RTP/AVP 97
  a=rtpmap:97 scip/90000
</sourcecode>

        <t>An example mapping for both "audio/scip" and "video/scip" is:</t>
        <sourcecode type="sdp">
  m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 96
  a=rtpmap:96 scip/8000
  m=video 50002 RTP/AVP 97
  a=rtpmap:97 scip/90000
</sourcecode>

<t>In accordance with the SDP Offer/Answer model <xref target="RFC3264"/>, the
   SCIP device <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> list the SCIP payload type number in order of
   preference in the "m" media line.</t>
        <t>For example, an SDP Offer with scip as the preferred audio media subtype:</t>
        <sourcecode type="sdp">
  m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 96 0 8
  a=rtpmap:96 scip/8000
  a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <!-- section 6 -->

<t>RTP packets using the payload format defined in this
   specification are subject to the security considerations
   discussed in the RTP specification <xref target="RFC3550"/>, and in any
   applicable RTP profile such as RTP/AVP <xref target="RFC3551"/>, RTP/AVPF
   <xref target="RFC4585"/>, RTP/SAVP <xref target="RFC3711"/>, or RTP/SAVPF <xref target="RFC5124"/>.
   However, as "Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does
   Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" <xref target="RFC7202"/>
   discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to
   discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic
   security goals like confidentiality, integrity, and source
   authenticity for RTP in general.  This responsibility lies on
   anyone using RTP in an application.  They can find guidance on
   available security mechanisms and important considerations in
   "Options for Securing RTP Sessions" <xref target="RFC7201"/>.
   Applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use one or more appropriate strong security mechanisms.
   The rest of this Security Considerations section discusses the
   security impacting properties of the payload format itself.</t>
      <t>This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit
   any significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side
   computational complexity for packet processing, and thus do not
   inherently pose a denial-of-service threat due to the receipt
   of pathological data, nor does the RTP payload format contain
   any active content.</t>
      <t>SCIP only encrypts the contents transported in the RTP payload; it does not protect
  the RTP header or RTCP packets. Applications requiring additional RTP headers and/or
  RTCP security might consider mechanisms such as SRTP <xref target="RFC3711"/>,
  however these additional mechanisms are considered <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> in this document.</t>
