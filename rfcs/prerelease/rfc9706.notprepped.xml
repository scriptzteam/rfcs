<section anchor="problem-statement">
      <name>Problem Statement</name>
      <t>Live streaming to mass audiences can impose unique demands on network
      resources.  For example, live sporting events that broadcast over the
      Internet to end users have a much lower tolerance for long playout
      buffers than typical on-demand video streaming.  Viewers of live
      sporting events have long been conditioned by broadcast television to
      expect to see the content in real time, with only very short buffers for
      broadcast delays to prevent profanity and other objectionable content
      from making on the air (this is known as the "seven-second delay" <xref
      target="BROADCAST-DELAY"/>).  With micro-betting, even this 5 to 10 second
      delay can be too long. By comparison, when watching on-demand movies, an
      extra one- or two-minute playout buffer tends to be perfectly acceptable
      for viewers.  If playout buffers for live sports are that long, viewers
      run the risk of being alerted to a game-winning score from text
      messages from friends or cheers from the bar across the street minutes
      before they view it themselves.</t>
      <t>Another unique characteristic of live streaming is the join rate.  While
      on-demand video streaming can consume massive amounts of network
      resources, the viewing rates tend to be smooth and predictable.  Service
      Providers (SPs) observe gradual levels of traffic increases over the evening
      hours corresponding to prime-time viewing habits.  By comparison,
      viewing rates of live video streams can more closely resemble a step
      function with much less predictability as mass audiences of viewers tune
      in to watch the game at the same time.</t>
      <t>Previous efforts for more efficient network replication of
      multi-destination traffic have experienced mixed success in terms of
      adoption.  IP multicast is widely deployed on financial networks, video
      distribution networks, L3VPN networks, and certain enterprises.  However, most
      of these deployments are restricted to "walled-garden" networks.
      Multicast over the global Internet has failed to gain traction, as only
      a very small portion of the Internet is multicast enabled at this
      time.</t>

      <t>TreeDN is a tree-based CDN architecture that is the result of the
      evolution of network-based replication mechanisms and is based on lessons
      learned from what has and has not worked well in the past.  TreeDN
      addresses the fundamental issues of what has hindered multicast from
      adoption on the global Internet and enables SPs the
      opportunity to deliver new Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) offerings to
      content providers, while more efficiently utilizing network resources by
      eliminating duplicated traffic. Thus, this improves the experience of
      end users.  TreeDN accomplishes this with the combination of a
      simplified model of native multicast along with network overlays to
      reach receivers on unicast-only parts of the Internet.</t>

      <t>By more efficiently supporting multi-destination traffic, TreeDN is
      an architecture that can enable new types of content (such as AR live streaming to mass audiences) that previously weren't
      possible or economically viable on the Internet due to the
      inefficiencies of unicast.</t>

    <section anchor="applicability">
      <name>Applicability</name>
      <t>While the primary use case mentioned throughout this document is live
      streaming of multimedia content (e.g., audio, video, AR, and real-time telemetry
      data), the TreeDN architecture can provide efficient delivery for any
      content that needs to be replicated and delivered to multiple
      destinations.  For example, large software file updates (e.g., OS
      upgrades) that need to be delivered to many end users in a very short
      window of time can cause significant strain on network resources.  Using
      TreeDN, this use case can be handled much more efficiently by the
      network.</t>

    <section anchor="multicast-challenges-in-the-past">
      <name>Multicast Challenges in the Past</name>
      <t>The following issues have been some of the primary challenges for
      deployment of IP multicast over the global Internet. This is not
      intended to be an exhaustive list but rather a list that provides context for the solution and how it addresses these primary challenges.</t>
      <ul>

          <li>The "All or Nothing" problem: IP multicast requires
          every Layer 3 hop between the source and receivers to be
          multicast enabled.  To achieve ubiquitous availability on the global
          Internet, this essentially means that nearly every interface on every
          router and firewall between all end hosts must support a multicast
          routing protocol (such as Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode
          (PIM-SM) <xref target="RFC7761"/> or the Multipoint Label Distribution
          Protocol (mLDP) <xref target="RFC6388"/>).  This requirement creates
          a bar to deployment that is practically impossible to overcome.</li>

          <li>The "It's Too Complex" problem: Operators have long
          complained that multicast routing protocols like PIM-SM are simply
          too complex, making it costly to design, configure, manage, and
          troubleshoot IP multicast in the network.</li>

          <li>The "Chicken and Egg" problem: There's not much
          multicast content because there's not much of a multicast-enabled
          audience, but there's not much of a multicast-enabled audience
          because there's not much multicast content.</li>

        </ul>
      <t>TreeDN is the evolution of network-based replication based on lessons
      learned over decades and is designed to address the problems listed
      above.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="treedn-architecture">
      <name>TreeDN Architecture</name>
      <t>TreeDN leverages a simplified model for multicast deployment combined
      with network overlays to deliver traffic to receiving hosts on
      unicast-only networks.  With network overlays, a service can be achieved
      and delivered to end users while recognizing and tolerating the
      practical realities of what is possible over a network as diverse as the
      global Internet.  That is, the replication service is available to users
      and applications across the global Internet regardless of what protocols
      may exist in the underlying networks that constitute the underlay.</t>

      <section anchor="treedn-overlays">
        <name>TreeDN Overlays</name>
        <t>One overlay technology that TreeDN leverages is Automatic Multicast
        Tunneling (AMT) <xref target="RFC7450"/>.  With AMT, end hosts on
        unicast-only networks (AMT Gateways) can dynamically build tunnels to
        routers on the multicast-enabled part of the network (AMT Relays) and
        receive multicast streams.  The AMT Gateway is a thin software client
        that typically sits on the receiving end host and initiates the tunnel
        at an AMT Relay. The AMT Relay is a tunnel server that typically sits
        at the border of the multicast network.  AMT allows any end host on
        the Internet to receive multicast content regardless of whether their
        local provider supports multicast (aka, "off-net receivers"), which
        addresses the "All or Nothing" problem.  Links and devices that do not
        support multicast are simply tunneled over -- they no longer present a
        barrier to the overall replication service for end users.  Those
        networks that do deploy and support multicast, as well as the content
        providers that serve up multicast content, are able to enjoy the
        benefits of efficient replication and delivery.  Further, these
        benefits can serve as incentives for operators who do not yet support
        multicast to enable it on their networks, which is a key benefit of incremental
        deployment described in <xref target="RFC9049" sectionFormat="of"
        section="4.3"/>.  Once the cost of carrying duplicated unicast tunnels
        is perceived by those operators to exceed the cost of deploying
        multicast, they are more likely to enable multicast on
	their networks. Thus, TreeDN effectively supports incremental deployment
	in a way that was
	not previously possible with traditional (non-overlay)
        multicast networking.  Finally, AMT also addresses the "Chicken and
        Egg" problem, as all end hosts on the global Internet that have access
        to an AMT Relay are capable of becoming audience members.</t>
        <t>To support receiving on both native and non-native networks,
        receiving hosts can first attempt to join the traffic natively, and if
        no multicast traffic is received, they can fall back to AMT.  This fallback
        mechanism can be handled by the application layer.</t>

        <t>In addition to AMT, other overlay technologies like the Locator/ID
        Separation Protocol (LISP) <xref target="RFC9300"/> can be utilized to
        deliver content from multicast-enabled networks to end hosts that are
        separated by portions of the network (at the last/middle/first mile)
        that do not support multicast.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="treedn-native-on-net">
        <name>TreeDN Native On-Net</name>
        <t>Networks that support multicast provide the native on-net component
        of TreeDN.  The primary requirement of the native on-net component is to support
        Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) <xref target="RFC4607"/>.  PIM-SSM,
        which is merely a subset of PIM-SM, is the multicast routing protocol
        typically used in SSM.  However, any multicast routing protocol
        capable of supporting SSM can be used in the TreeDN native on-net component, such
        as mLDP, Global Table Multicast (GTM) <xref target="RFC7716"/>,
        BGP-based Multicast <xref target="I-D.ietf-bess-bgp-multicast"/>, or
        even BGP Multicast VPN (BGP-MVPN) <xref target="RFC6513"/> for those operators
	who carry
        the global routing table in a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table.
	Likewise, any data plane
        technology that supports SSM, including Bit Index Explicit Replication
        (BIER) <xref target="RFC8279"/> and Segment Routing (SR) Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) <xref target="RFC9524"/>,
        can be used.</t>

        <t>The key benefit of SSM as the native on-net component of TreeDN is
        that it radically simplifies the control plane needed to support
        replication in the network.  This simplification comes by moving
        source discovery from the network layer to some sort of out-of-band
        mechanism, usually in the application layer. In SSM, the receiver
        uses the Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) <xref
        target="RFC3376"/> for IPv4 or the Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2
        (MLDv2) protocol <xref target="RFC3810"/> for IPv6 to specify both the source
        and group address of the multicast stream.  This allows the last-hop
        router to immediately join the multicast stream along the
        shortest-path tree (SPT) without the need for shared trees.  This
        benefit addresses the "It's Too Complex" problem.  By eliminating the
        need for network-based source discovery, most of the complexity of
        multicast is then eliminated, which reduces the cost of deploying and
        operating a multicast network.  Further rationale for this SSM-only
        approach can be found in Any-Source Multicast (ASM) Deprecation <xref
        target="RFC8815"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="replication-as-a-service-raas">
      <name>Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS)</name>
      <t>Content providers have traditionally used CDNs to distribute content
      that needs to be delivered to large audiences, essentially outsourcing
      the task of replication to CDN providers.  Most CDNs utilize unicast
      delivery, as multicast is not an option due to its lack of general
      availability on the global Internet.  TreeDN is a CDN architecture that
      leverages tree-based replication to more efficiently utilize network
      resources to deliver simultaneous multi-destination traffic.  By
      leveraging overlay networking to address the "All or Nothing" and
      "Chicken and Egg" problems, and leveraging SSM to address the "It's Too Complex"
      problem, TreeDN avoids the practical issues that previously prevented
      multicast from being a viable option for CDN providers.</t>
      <t>TreeDN has several advantages over traditional unicast-based CDN
      approaches.  First, the TreeDN functionality can be delivered entirely
      by the existing network infrastructure.  Specifically, for operators
      with routers that support AMT natively, multicast traffic can be
      delivered directly to end users without the need for specialized CDN
      devices, which typically are servers that need to be racked, powered,
      cooled, and connected to ports on routers that otherwise could have been
      consumed by paying customers.  In this way, SPs can offer new RaaS
      functionality to content providers at potentially zero additional cost
      in new equipment.</t>
      <t>Additionally, TreeDN is an open architecture that leverages mature,
      IETF-specified, and widely implemented network protocols.  TreeDN also
      requires far less coordination between the content provider and the CDN
      operator.  That is, there are no storage requirements for the data, nor
      group-key management issues, since a TreeDN provider merely forwards
      packets.  A TreeDN provider simply needs to have enough accounting data
      (e.g., traffic data, number of AMT tunnels, etc.) to properly bill
      customers for the service.  By contrast, traditional unicast-based CDNs
      often incorporate proprietary, non-interoperable technologies and
      require significant coordination between the content provider and the
      CDN to handle such things as file storage, data protection, and
      key management.</t>
      <t>TreeDN introduces a deployment model that requires new considerations
      for transport-layer mechanisms that are frequently relied upon by
      traditional unicast-based CDNs.  A discussion on these considerations
      and differences can be found in <xref
      target="transport-layer-related-differences-between-treedn-and-traditional-cdns"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="decentralizationdemocratization-of-content-sourcing">
      <name>Decentralization/Democratization of Content Sourcing</name>
      <t>TreeDN is an inherently decentralized architecture.  This reduces the
      cost for content sourcing, as any host connected to a multicast-enabled
      network or on a source-capable overlay can send out a single data
      stream that can be reached by an arbitrarily large audience.  By
      effectively reducing the marginal cost of reaching each
      additional audience member to zero, from the perspective of the source, TreeDN
      democratizes content sourcing on the Internet.</t>

      <name>Transport-Layer-Related Differences between TreeDN and Traditional CDNs</name>
      <t>The focus of this document is on the network-layer components that
      comprise the TreeDN architecture.  This section introduces some of the
      key transport-layer-related differences between TreeDN and traditional
      unicast-based CDNs that should be taken into consideration when
      deploying TreeDN-based services.  In many cases, these issues are more
      related to differences between TCP and UDP than differences between unicast and multicast; thus,
      UDP-based solutions can be leveraged to address most gaps.  The aim of
      this section is to point to some of the existing work to address these
      gaps, as well as to suggest further work that could be undertaken within
      the IETF.  Further details of these transport-layer mechanisms are
      beyond the scope of this document.</t>

<section anchor="integration-with-unicast">
        <name>Integration with Unicast</name>
        <t>Since SSM inherently implies unidirectional traffic flows from one
        to many, mechanisms that rely on bidirectional communication between
        receivers and the content provider (such as bespoke advertising,
        telemetry data from receivers detailing end-user experience,
        distribution of decryption keys, switching to higher or lower bandwidth
        streams, etc.) are not well suited to SSM delivery.  As such, separate
        unicast streams between receivers and content providers may be used
        for this type of "out-of-band" function while SSM is used to deliver
        the actual content of interest.  These "out-of-band" unicast streams
        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the same congestion control and authentication mechanisms
        that are used today for mass audience unicast delivery.  Generally
        speaking, this hybrid unicast-multicast approach is best handled by
        the application layer and further detail is beyond the scope of this
        document.</t>

        <t>Traditional unicast-based CDNs frequently rely on HTTPS over TCP
        transport; thus, they are able to leverage the granularity of TCP-based
        mechanisms for reliability, congestion control, and adaptive bitrate
        streaming.  However, this granularity comes at a cost of sending a separate
        data stream to each viewer.  Multicast transmissions usually employ
        UDP, which inherently lacks many of the aforementioned benefits of
        TCP but can scale much better for mass audiences of simultaneous
        viewers.  Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a mechanism that has
        demonstrated full recovery for up to 5% packet loss and interruptions
        up to 400 ms for multicast data streams in <xref
        target="EUMETSAT-TERRESTRIAL"/>.  NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast
        (NORM) <xref target="RFC5740"/> leverages FEC-based repair and other
        Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks to provide end-to-end
        reliable transport over multicast networks.</t>
        <t>QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> is another popular transport used by
        traditional unicast-based CDNs.  While QUIC does use UDP, it does not
        currently support multicast.  Multicast extensions to QUIC have been
        proposed in <xref target="I-D.jholland-quic-multicast"/>.</t>


        <t><xref target="RFC8085" sectionFormat="of" section="4.1"/> describes
        how a sender can distribute data across multiple multicast
        source-group channels so that each receiver can join the most
        appropriate channels for its own reception rate capability, thus
        providing adaptive bitrate capabilities for multicast streams. <xref target="DVB-MABR"/> and <xref target="MAUD"/>
        extensively describe an architecture that enables reliability and
        dynamic bitrate adaptation.</t>

        <t>TreeDN deployments <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> follow the congestion control guidelines
        described in <xref target="RFC7450" sectionFormat="of"
        section="4.1.4.2"/>. A multicast application that is being distributed over
        TreeDN deployments <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> implement congestion control for its data
        transmission as described in <xref target="RFC8085" sectionFormat="of"
        section="4.1"/>.  The AMT gateway <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the topologically closest
        AMT relay. <xref target="RFC8777" sectionFormat="of" section="3.1"/>
        describes a set of procedures for optimal relay selection.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="authorization-and-encryption">
        <name>Authorization and Encryption</name>


<t>A multicast sender typically has little to no control or visibility
        about which end hosts may receive the data stream.  Encryption can be
        used to ensure that only authorized receivers are able to access
        meaningful data.  That is, even if unauthorized end hosts (e.g.,
        non-paying end hosts) receive the data stream, without decryption keys, the data
        is useless.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2"/> describes an
        extension to the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for the
        purpose of group key management.  <xref target="DVB-MABR"/>
        and <xref target="MAUD"/> extensively describe an architecture
        that includes encryption of multicast streams.</t>

      <name>TreeDN Deployments</name>
      <t>EUMETCast Terrestrial is a service from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) that delivers
      meteorological satellite data to end users for purposes such as
      operational monitoring of climates and detection of global climate
      changes.  EUMETCast Terrestrial connects to the GEANT network, which
      provides TreeDN services to deliver this real-time data natively to end
      users on multicast-enabled networks and to end users on
      unicast-only networks via a global deployment of AMT relays.  Details of
      the EUMETCast Terrestrial service over the GEANT TreeDN network are
      described in <xref target="EUMETCast-TERRESTRIAL-AMT"/>.
      Additional details on how this deployment uses encryption,
      authorization, reliability, and unicast feedback channels for end-to-end
      file delivery monitoring can be found in <xref
      target="EUMETSAT-TERRESTRIAL"/>.</t>

      <t>The Multicast Menu <xref target="Multicast-Menu"/> is a web-based portal that can list and launch
      active multicast streams that are available on a global TreeDN network
      of various research and education networks.  Details of this TreeDN
      network, as well as the Multicast Menu, are described in <xref
      target="Offnet-Sourcing-Multicast-Menu"/>.</t>

      <t>The RARE network is a global testbed interconnecting several National
      Research and Education Networks (NRENs) via routers running BIER.  AMT
      relays are deployed to deliver multicast traffic from sources on the
      RARE network to receivers on unicast-only networks across the Internet.
      Details of the RARE network are described in <xref
      target="BIER-AMT-Deployment"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="operational-considerations">
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>TreeDN is essentially the synthesis of SSM plus overlay networking
      technologies like AMT.  As such, any existing tools to manage, operate,
      and troubleshoot a PIM-SSM domain and an AMT deployment can be used to
      manage a TreeDN deployment.  Protocol error handling for PIM-SSM can be
      found in <xref target="RFC4607"/> and in <xref target="RFC7761"
      sectionFormat="of" section="4.8"/>; for AMT, it can be found in <xref
      target="RFC7450"/>.</t>
      <t>One potential operational benefit of a multicast-based approach like
      TreeDN over a traditional, unicast-based CDN is the visibility that
      multicast state provides in the routing infrastructure.  That is,
      multicast routers maintain a forwarding cache of multicast flows that
      usually includes the source address, group address, incoming/outgoing
      interfaces, and forwarding rate.  Generally speaking, such flow state
      information is not typically available in core networks for unicast, so
      additional tools outside the routing infrastructure are usually required
      for monitoring CDN performance and troubleshooting issues like packet
      loss location.  Of course, this benefit comes at a cost of additional
      state being maintained in the routers for multicast.</t>

      <t>Additionally, since multicast leverages Reverse Path Forwarding
      (RPF), the source of the content can potentially have a greater
      influence over the path taken through the network from source to native
      receivers/AMT relays.  That is, the BGP peer advertising the
      reachability of the source's subnet can do so in ways where a particular path through the network is preferred for multicast distribution; these methods are
      not as easy to accomplish with traditional, destination-based unicast
      routing.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-consideration">
      <name>Security Consideration</name>
      <t>Since TreeDN is essentially the synthesis of SSM plus overlay
      networking technologies like AMT, the TreeDN architecture introduces no
      new security threats that are not already documented in SSM and the
      overlay technologies that comprise it.  In particular, <xref
      target="RFC7450" sectionFormat="of" section="6"/> candidly notes that
      AMT, like UDP, IGMP, and MLD, provides no mechanisms for ensuring message
      delivery or integrity, nor does it provide confidentiality, since
      sources/groups joined through IGMP/MLD could be associated with the
      particular content being requested.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC4609"/> and <xref target="RFC8815"/> describe the
      additional security benefits of using SSM instead of ASM.</t>

      <t>With inspiration from (and apologies to) Radia Perlman <xref target="Algorhyme"/> and Joyce Kilmer <xref target="Trees"/>, the following poem is not intended to provide any normative or informative technical value on TreeDN beyond (mild) amusement for the reader who made it this far in the document:</t>
      <t>I think that I shall never see<br/>
A CDN more lovely than a tree.</t>
      <t>A tree whose crucial property<br/>
Is efficient mass-audience delivery.</t>
      <t>Using SSM for simplified operation<br/>
Of native branches that eliminate duplication.</t>
      <t>A tree extended by AMT,<br/>
Enabling unicast-only receivers full delivery.</t>
      <t>A tree that scales to reach millions of places<br/>
To viably support the highest of bitrate use cases.</t>
      <t>A CDN is built by folks like me,<br/>
But only end users can generate enough demand to necessitate a tree.</t>
