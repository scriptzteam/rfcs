	<abstract>
	    <t>
	    The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly used to verify
	    connectivity between two systems.  BFD packets are typically very small.  It is
	    desirable in some circumstances to know not only that the path between two systems is
	    reachable, but also that it is capable of carrying a payload of a particular size.
	    This document specifies how to implement such a mechanism using BFD in Asynchronous
	    mode.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	    YANG modules for managing this mechanism are also defined in this document.  These
	    YANG modules augment the existing BFD YANG modules defined in RFC 9314.
	    The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management Datastore
	    Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342).

	  <name>Introduction</name>
	    <t>
	    The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) <xref target="RFC5880"/> protocol is commonly
	    used to verify connectivity between two systems.  However, some applications may require
	    that the Path MTU <xref target="RFC1191"/> between those two systems meets a certain
	    minimum criterion.  When the Path MTU decreases below the minimum threshold, those
	    applications may wish to consider the path unusable.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    BFD may be encapsulated in a number of transport protocols.  An example is
	    single-hop BFD <xref target="RFC5881"/>.  In that case, the link MTU configuration is
	    typically enough to guarantee communication between the two systems for that size MTU.
	    BFD Echo mode (<xref target="RFC5880" sectionFormat="of" section="6.4"/>) is sufficient to permit
	    verification of the Path MTU of such directly connected systems.  Previous proposals 
	    (e.g., <xref target="I-D.haas-xiao-bfd-echo-path-mtu"/>)
	    have been made for testing Path MTU for such directly connected systems.
	    However, in the case of multihop BFD <xref target="RFC5883"/>, this guarantee does not hold.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    The encapsulation of BFD in multihop sessions is a simple UDP packet.  The BFD elements
	    of procedure (<xref target="RFC5880" sectionFormat="of" section="6.8.6"/>) cover validating the BFD
	    payload.  However, the specification is silent on the length of the encapsulation that is
	    carrying the BFD PDU.  While it is most common that the transport protocol payload (i.e.,
	    UDP) length is the exact size of the BFD PDU, this is not required by the elements of
	    procedure.  This leads to the possibility that the transport protocol length may be
	    larger than the contained BFD PDU.

	  <name>BFD Encapsulated in Large Packets</name>
	    <t>
	    Support for BFD between two systems is typically configured, even if the actual session
	    may be dynamically created by a client protocol.  A new BFD variable is defined in this
	    document:
	    </t>

            <dl newline='true'>
            <dt>bfd.PaddedPduSize</dt>
            <dd>
            The BFD transport protocol payload size (in bytes) is increased to this value.  The
            contents of this additional payload <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be zero.  The contents of this additional
            payload <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be validated by the receiver. 

The minimum size of this variable
            <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be smaller than 24 or 26 bytes, as permitted by the element of BFD procedure; see
            <xref target="RFC5880" sectionFormat="of" section="6.8.6"/>.
	    </dd>
            </dl>

	    <t>
	    The Don't Fragment bit (<xref target="RFC0791" sectionFormat="of" section="2.3"/>)
	    of the IP payload, when using IPv4 encapsulation, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set.

	  <name>Implementation and Deployment Considerations</name>
	    <section>
	      <name>Implementations That Do Not Support Large BFD Packets</name>
	      <t>
	      While this document proposes no change to the BFD protocol, implementations may not
	      permit arbitrarily padded transport PDUs to carry BFD packets.  While  
	      <xref target="RFC5880" sectionFormat="of" section="6"/> warns against excessive pedantry, implementations may not work
	      with this mechanism without additional support.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      <xref target="RFC5880" sectionFormat="of" section="6.8.6"/> discusses the procedures for receiving
	      BFD Control packets.  The length of the BFD Control packet is validated to be less
              than or equal to the payload of the encapsulating protocol. When a receiving
              implementation is incapable of processing large BFD packets, it could manifest in one
              of two possible ways:
	      </t>

              <ul>
	      <li>
	      A receiving BFD implementation is incapable of accepting large BFD packets.
	      This is identical to the packet being discarded.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      A receiving BFD implementation is capable of accepting large BFD packets,
	      but the Control packet is improperly rejected during validation procedures.
	      This is identical to the packet being discarded.
	      </li>
	      </ul>

	      <t>
	      In each of these cases, the BFD state machine would behave as if it were not
	      receiving Control packets, and the receiving implementation would follow normal BFD
	      procedures regarding not having received Control packets.
	      </t>

	      <t>
              If large BFD packets is enabled on a session that is already in the Up state
              and the remote BFD system does not (or cannot) support receiving the padded
              BFD control packets, the session will go Down.
	      </t>
	    </section>

	    <section>
	      <name>Selecting MTU Size To Be Detected</name>
	      <t>
	      Since the consideration is Path MTU, BFD sessions using this feature only need to use an appropriate value of 
	      bfd.PaddedPduSize to exercise the Path MTU for the desired application.
	      This may be significantly smaller than the system's link MTU, e.g., desired Path MTU is
	      1512 bytes, while the interface MTU that BFD with large packets is running on is 9000
	      bytes.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      In the case multiple BFD clients desire to test the same BFD endpoints using
	      different bfd.PaddedPduSize parameters, implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> select the largest
	      bfd.PaddedPduSize parameter from the configured sessions.  This is similar to
	      how implementations of BFD select the most aggressive timing parameters for multiple
	      sessions to the same endpoint.  Failure to select the largest size will result in BFD
	      sessions going to the Up state and dependent applications not having their MTU
	      requirements satisfied.
	      </t>
	    </section>

	    <section>
	      <name>Detecting MTU Mismatches</name>
	      <t>
	      The accepted MTU for an interface is impacted by packet encapsulation
	      considerations at a given layer, e.g., Layer 2, Layer 3, tunnel, etc.  A common
	      misconfiguration of interface parameters is inconsistent MTU.  In the presence
	      of inconsistent MTU, it is possible for applications to have unidirectional
	      connectivity.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      When it is necessary for an application using BFD with Large Packets to test
              the bidirectional Path MTU, it is necessary to configure the
              bfd.PaddedPduSize parameter on each side of the BFD session. For example, if
	      the desire is to verify a 1512-byte MTU in both directions on an Ethernet or
              point-to-point link, each side of the BFD session must have bfd.PaddedPduSize
	      set to 1512.  In the absence of such consistent configuration, BFD with 
	      Large Packets may correctly determine unidirectional connectivity at the
	      tested MTU, but bidirectional MTU may not be properly validated.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      It should be noted that some interfaces may intentionally have different MTUs.
	      Setting the bfd.PaddedPduSize appropriately for each side of the BFD session
	      supports such scenarios.
	      </t>
	    </section>

	    <section>
	      <name>Detecting MTU Changes</name>
	      <t>
              Once BFD sessions using Large Packets has reached the Up state,
              connectivity at the tested MTU(s) for the session is being
              validated.  If the Path MTU tested by the BFD with Large Packets
              session falls below the tested MTU, the BFD session will go Down.
              </t>
              <t>
              In the opposite circumstance (where the Path MTU increases), the
              BFD session will continue without being impacted.  BFD for Large
              Packets only ensures that the minimally acceptable MTU for the
              session can be used.
	      </t>
	    </section>

	    <section>
	      <name>Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) or Other Load-Balancing Considerations</name>
	      <t>
	      Various mechanisms are utilized to increase throughput between two endpoints
	      at various network layers.  Such features include Link Aggregation Groups (LAGs)
	      or ECMP forwarding. Such mechanisms balance traffic across multiple physical
	      links while hiding the details of that balancing from the higher networking
	      layers.  The details of that balancing are highly implementation specific.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      In the presence of such load-balancing mechanisms, it is possible to have
	      member links that are not properly forwarding traffic.  In such circumstances,
	      this will result in dropped traffic when traffic is chosen to be load balanced
	      across those member links.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      Such load-balancing mechanisms may not permit all link members to be properly
	      tested by BFD.  This is because the BFD Control packets may be forwarded only
	      along links that are up.  BFD on LAG interfaces, <xref target="RFC7130"/>, was developed
	      to help cover one such scenario.  However, for testing forwarding over
	      multiple hops, there is no such specified general-purpose BFD mechanism for
	      exercising all links in an ECMP.  This may result in a BFD session being in
	      the Up state while some traffic may be dropped or otherwise negatively
	      impacted along some component links.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      Some BFD implementations utilize their internal understanding of the component
	      links and their resultant forwarding to exercise BFD in such a way to better
	      test the ECMP members and to tie the BFD session state to the health of that
	      ECMP.  Due to implementation-specific load balancing, it is not possible
	      to standardize such additional mechanisms for BFD.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      Misconfiguration of some member MTUs may lead to load balancing that may have
	      an inconsistent Path MTU depending on how the traffic is balanced.  While the
	      intent of BFD with large packets is to verify Path MTU, it is subject to the
	      same considerations above.
	      </t>

	      <t>
	      This section applies to most, if not all, BFD techniques.
	      </t>


	    </section>

	    <section>
	      <name>S-BFD</name>
	    <t>
	    This mechanism also can be applied to other forms of BFD, including 
	    Seamless BFD (S-BFD) <xref target="RFC7880"/>.

                This YANG module augments the "ietf-bfd" module to add a flag
                'padding' to enable this feature. The feature statement
                'padding' needs to be enabled to indicate that BFD encapsulated
                in large packets is supported by the implementation.
                </t>

                <t>
                Further, this YANG module augments the YANG modules for single-hop,
                multihop, LAG, and MPLS to add the "pdu-size"
                parameter to those session types to configure large BFD packets.

                Finally, similar to the grouping "client-cfg-parms" defined in

                "bfd-large-common" that may be utilized by BFD clients using
                "client-cfg-params" to uniformly add support for the feature
                defined in this RFC.

	  <name>Security Considerations</name>
	    <t>
	    This document does not change the underlying security considerations of the BFD protocol
	    or its encapsulations.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    On-path attackers that can selectively drop BFD packets, including those with large
	    MTUs, can cause BFD sessions to go Down.
	    </t>

            <t>
            The contents of the padding payload are set to zero.  This avoids implementation issues
            where the local uninitialized data may be leaked.

	      <name>YANG Security Considerations</name>
                <t>
                This section is modeled after the template described in
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis" sectionFormat="of" section="3.7"/>.
                </t>

                <t>
                The "ietf-bfd-large" YANG module defines a data model that is
                designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
                NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. These protocols have to
                use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH <xref target="RFC4252"/>, TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and
                QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/>) and have to use mutual authentication.
                </t>

                <t>
                The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"/>
                provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
                RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
                RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
                </t>

                <t>
                There is one data node defined in this YANG module that is
                writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
                default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
                sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
                operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
                nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
                effect on network operations.  The data node
                has particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:
                </t>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    'pdu-size' specifies the targeted size of BFD control packets
                    encapsulated according to this proposal.  Changing this value for a
                    session in the Up state may cause the session to go down, perhaps
                    intentionally, if the session cannot accommodate such BFD control
                    packets.  Operators should be mindful that multiple BFD clients may
                    rely on the status of a given BFD session when changing this value.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <t>
                There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes.
                </t>

                <t>
                There are no particularly sensitive RPC or action operations.
                </t>
		<t>
		  Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
		  should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
		  example, reusing some of these groupings will expose privacy-related
		  information (e.g., 'node-example').  This module defines one such grouping,
		  "bfd-large-common", which contains the "pdu-size" data node whose security
		  considerations are documented above.
