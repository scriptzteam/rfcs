      <t>
	Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using electric power lines
	for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to
	support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart
	meters for electricity.  The existing electricity infrastructure
	facilitates the expansion of PLC deployments due to its potential
	advantages in terms of cost and convenience.  Moreover, a wide variety
	of accessible devices raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future
	applications. This document describes how IPv6 packets are transported
	over constrained PLC networks, such as those described in ITU-T G.9903,
        IEEE 1901.1, and IEEE 1901.2.

      <t>
	The idea of using power lines for both electricity supply and
	communication can be traced back to the beginning of the last century.
	Using the existing power grid to transmit messages, Power Line
	Communication (PLC) is a good candidate for supporting various service
	scenarios such as in houses and offices, in trains and vehicles, in
	smart grids, and in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) <xref
	target="SCENA" format="default"/>.  The data-acquisition devices in
	these scenarios share common features such as fixed position, large
	quantity of nodes, low data rate, and low power consumption.</t>
      <t>
	Although PLC technology has evolved over several decades, it has not
	been fully adapted for IPv6-based constrained networks.  The
	resource-constrained scenarios related to the Internet of Things (IoT)
	lie in the low voltage PLC networks with most applications in the area
	of AMI, vehicle-to-grid communications, in-home energy management, and
	smart street lighting.  IPv6 is important for PLC networks, due to its
	large address space and efficient address autoconfiguration.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document provides a brief overview of PLC technologies. Some of
	them have LLN (Low-Power and Lossy Network) characteristics, i.e.,
	limited power consumption, memory, and processing resources. This
	document specifies the transmission of IPv6 packets over those
	constrained PLC networks.  The general approach is to adapt elements
	of the 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network)
	and 6lo (IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes)
	specifications, such as those described in <xref target="RFC4944"
	format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC6282" format="default"/>, <xref
	target="RFC6775" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC8505"
	format="default"/>, to constrained PLC networks.

      <t>

	PLC technology enables convenient two-way communications for home
	users and utility companies to monitor and control electrically connected
	devices such as electricity meters and street lights. PLC can also be
	used in smart home scenarios, such as the control of indoor lights and
	switches. Due to the large range of communication frequencies, PLC is
	generally classified into two categories: Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) for
	automation of sensors (which have a low frequency band and low power
	cost) and Broadband PLC (BBPLC) for home and industry networking
	applications.
      </t>

      <t>
	Various standards have been addressed on the
	Media Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) layers. For example, standards for BBPLC (1.8-250
        MHz) include IEEE 1901 and ITU-T G.hn, and standards for
	NBPLC (3-500 kHz) include ITU-T G.9902 (G.hnem), ITU-T G.9903
	(G3-PLC) <xref target="ITU-T_G.9903" format="default"/>, ITU-T G.9904
	(PRIME), IEEE 1901.2  (a
	combination of G3-PLC and PRIME PLC) <xref target="IEEE_1901.2" format="default"/>, and IEEE 1901.2a (an amendment to IEEE
	1901.2) <xref target="IEEE_1901.2a" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	IEEE 1901.1 <xref target="IEEE_1901.1" format="default"/>, a PLC standard that is aimed at the medium frequency band of less
	than 12 MHz, was published by the IEEE standard for Smart Grid
	Powerline Communication Working Group (SGPLC WG). IEEE 1901.1 balances
	the needs for bandwidth versus communication range and is thus a
	promising option for 6lo applications. 
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification is focused on IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2, and ITU-T G.9903.

	The protocol stack for IPv6 over PLC is illustrated in <xref

	according to the IEEE EUI-48 MAC address
	or the IEEE EUI-64 address.  Each PLC device joins the network by
	using the long address and communicates with other devices by using
	the short address after joining the network. Short addresses can be
	assigned during the onboarding process, by the PANC or the JRC (join

	The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the MAC layer determines whether
	fragmentation and reassembly are needed at the adaptation layer of
	IPv6 over PLC.  IPv6 requires an MTU of 1280 octets or greater; thus,
	for a MAC layer with an MTU lower than this limit,
	fragmentation and reassembly at the adaptation layer are required.
        </t>
        <t>
	The IEEE 1901.1 MAC supports upper-layer packets up to 2031 octets.
	The IEEE 1901.2 MAC layer supports an MTU of 1576 octets (the original
	value of 1280 bytes was updated in 2015 <xref target="IEEE_1901.2a"
	format="default"/>).  Though these two technologies can support
	IPv6 originally without fragmentation and reassembly, it is possible
	to configure a smaller MTU in a high-noise communication environment.
	Thus, the 6lo functions, including header compression, fragmentation,
	and reassembly, are still applicable and useful.
        </t>
        <t>
	The MTU for ITU-T G.9903 is 400 octets, which is insufficient for

    A PLC node distinguishes between an IPv6 PDU and a non-IPv6 PDU based on
    the equivalent of an Ethertype in a Layer 2 PLC PDU. <xref target="RFC7973"
    format="default"/> defines an Ethertype of "A0ED" for LoWPAN encapsulation,
    and this information can be carried in the IE field in the MAC header of
    <xref target="IEEE_1901.2" format="default"/> or <xref
    target="ITU-T_G.9903" format="default"/>.  And regarding <xref
    target="IEEE_1901.1" format="default"/>, the IP packet type has been
    defined with the corresponding MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU) type value 49.
    And the 4-bit Internet Protocol version number in the IP header helps to
    distinguish between an IPv4 PDU and an IPv6 PDU.

    6LoWPAN and 6lo standards, as described in <xref target="RFC4944"
    format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC6282" format="default"/>, <xref
    target="RFC6775" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC8505"
    format="default"/>, provide useful functionality, including link-local IPv6
    addresses, stateless address autoconfiguration, neighbor discovery,
    header compression, fragmentation, and reassembly.  However, due to the
    different characteristics of the PLC media, the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer,
    as it is, cannot perfectly fulfill the requirements of PLC
    environments. These considerations suggest the need for a dedicated
    adaptation layer for PLC, which is detailed in the following
    subsections.</t>
      <section anchor="slaac" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration</name>
        <t>
	To obtain an IPv6 Interface Identifier (IID), a PLC device performs
	stateless address autoconfiguration <xref target="RFC4944"
	format="default"/>.  The autoconfiguration can be based on either a
	long or short link-layer address.
        </t>
        <t>
	The IID can be based on the device's 48-bit MAC address or its EUI-64
	identifier <xref target="EUI-64" format="default"/>.  A 48-bit MAC
	address <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> first be extended to a 64-bit IID
	by inserting 0xFFFE at the fourth and fifth octets as specified in
	<xref target="RFC2464" format="default"/>.  The IPv6 IID is derived
	from the 64-bit IID by inverting the U/L (Universal/Local)
	bit <xref target="RFC4291" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
	For IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903, a 48-bit "pseudo-address" is formed
	by the 16-bit PAN ID, 16 zero bits, and the 16-bit short address as
	follows:
        </t>
          <t indent="3"> 16_bit_PAN:0000:16_bit_short_address </t>
        <t>
	Then, the 64-bit IID <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be derived by inserting the 16-bit
	0xFFFE into as follows:
        </t>
          <t indent="3"> 16_bit_PAN:00FF:FE00:16_bit_short_address </t>
        <t>
	For the 12-bit short addresses used by IEEE 1901.1, the 48-bit
	pseudo-address is formed by a 24-bit NID (Network Identifier, YYYYYY),
	12 zero bits, and a 12-bit TEI (Terminal Equipment Identifier, XXX) as follows:
        </t>
          <t indent="3"> YYYY:YY00:0XXX </t>
        <t>
	The 64-bit IID <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be derived by inserting the 16-bit 0xFFFE
	into this 48-bit pseudo-address as follows:
        </t>
          <t indent="3"> YYYY:YYFF:FE00:0XXX </t>
        <t>
	As investigated in <xref target="RFC7136" format="default"/>, aside from the method discussed in
	<xref target="RFC4291" format="default"/>, other 
	IID-generation methods defined by the IETF do not imply any additional semantics for the
	Universal/Local (U/L) bit (bit 6) and the Individual/Group bit (bit
	7). Therefore, these two bits are not reliable indicators.  Thus, when using an IID derived by a short address,
	the operators of the PLC network can choose whether or not to comply with the original
	meaning of these two bits.  If they choose to
  comply with the original meaning, these two bits <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
	both be set to zero, since the IID derived from the short address is not global. In order to avoid any ambiguity in the derived
	IID, these two bits <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be a valid part
	of the PAN ID (for IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903) or NID (for IEEE
	1901.1). For example, the PAN ID or NID must always be chosen so that
	the two bits are zeros or the high six bits in PAN ID or NID are left
	shifted by two bits. If they choose not to comply with the original meaning, the operator must be aware that these two
	bits are not reliable indicators, and the IID cannot be transformed
	back into a short link-layer address via a reverse operation of the
	mechanism presented above. However, the short address can still be
	obtained via the Unicast Address Mapping mechanism described in <xref
	target="unicast-map" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
	For privacy reasons, the IID derived from the MAC address (with
	padding and bit clamping) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only be used for
	link-local address configuration.  A PLC host <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
	use the IID derived from the short link-layer address to configure
	IPv6 addresses used for communication with the public network;
	otherwise, the host's MAC address is exposed. As per <xref
	target="RFC8065" format="default"/>, when short addresses are used on
	PLC links, a shared secret key or version number from the
	Authoritative Border Router Option <xref target="RFC6775"
	format="default"/> can be used to improve the entropy of the hash
	input. Thus, the generated IID can be spread out to the full range of
	the IID address space while stateless address compression is still
	allowed. By default, the hash algorithm 
	<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be SHA256, using the version number, the
	PAN ID or NID, and the short address as the input arguments, and the
	256-bit hash output is truncated into the IID by taking the high 64
	bits.

<section anchor="Topologies" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Internet Connectivity Scenarios and Topologies</name>
      <t>
    The PLC network model can be simplified to two kinds of network devices:
    PAN Coordinator (PANC) and PLC device.  The PANC is the primary
    coordinator of the PLC subnet and can be seen as a primary node; PLC
    devices are typically PLC meters and sensors.  The address registration
    and DAD features can also be deployed on the PANC, for example, the 6LBR
    <xref target="RFC6775" format="default"/> or the routing registrar
    <xref target="RFC8505" format="default"/>. IPv6 over PLC networks are
    built as tree, mesh, or star topologies according to the use cases.
    Generally, each PLC network has one PANC. In some cases, the PLC network
    can have alternate coordinators to replace the PANC when the PANC leaves
    the network for some reason.  Note that the PLC topologies in this section
    are based on logical connectivity, not physical links. The term "PLC
    subnet" refers to a multilink subnet, in which the PLC devices share the
    same address prefix.
</t>
      <t>
    The star topology is common in current PLC scenarios.  In single-hop star
    topologies, communication at the link layer only takes place between a PLC
    device and a PANC.  The PANC typically collects data (e.g., a meter
    reading) from the PLC devices and then concentrates and uploads the data
    through Ethernet or cellular networks (see <xref target="fig-plc-star"
    format="default"/>).  The collected data is transmitted by the smart
    meters through PLC, aggregated by a concentrator, and sent to the utility and
    then to a Meter Data Management System for data storage, analysis, and
    billing.  This topology has been widely applied in the deployment of smart
    meters, especially in apartment buildings.

    A tree topology is useful when the distance between a device A and the PANC is
    beyond the PLC-allowed limit and there is another device B in between
    able to communicate with both sides.  Device B in this case acts as both 
    a PLC device and a Coordinator.

    For this scenario, the link-layer
    communications take place between device A and device B, and between
    device B and PANC.  An example of a PLC tree network is depicted
    in <xref target="fig-plc-tree" format="default"/>.  This topology can be applied in 
    smart street lighting, where the lights adjust the brightness to reduce
    energy consumption while sensors are deployed on the street lights to
    provide information such as light intensity, temperature, and humidity.
    The data-transmission distance in the street lighting scenario is normally
    above several kilometers; thus, a PLC tree network is required.  A more
    sophisticated AMI network may also be constructed into the tree topology
    that is depicted in <xref target="RFC8036" format="default"/>.  A tree topology is suitable
    for AMI scenarios that require large coverage but low density,
    e.g., the deployment of smart meters in rural areas.  RPL is suitable
    for maintenance of a tree topology in which there is no need for
    communication directly between PAN devices.

   Mesh networking in PLC has many potential applications and has been
   studied for several years.  By connecting all nodes with their neighbors
   in communication range (see <xref target="fig-plc-mesh" format="default"/>), a mesh
   topology dramatically enhances the communication efficiency and thus
   expands the size of PLC networks.  A simple use case is the smart home
   scenario where the ON/OFF state of air conditioning is controlled by
   the state of home lights (ON/OFF) and doors (OPEN/CLOSE). AODV-RPL <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl" format="default"/>
   enables direct communication between PLC devices, without being obliged
   to transmit frames through the PANC, which is a requirement often cited
   for the AMI infrastructure.

      <name>Operations and Manageability Considerations</name>
      <t>
	Constrained PLC networks are not managed in the same way as
	enterprise networks or carrier networks. Constrained PLC networks,
	like the other IoT networks, are designed to be self-organized and
	self-managed. The software or firmware is flashed into the devices
	before deployment by the vendor or operator. And during the deployment
	process, the devices are bootstrapped, and no extra configuration is
	needed to get the devices connected to each other. Once a device
	becomes offline, it goes back to the bootstrapping stage and tries to
	rejoin the network. The onboarding status of the devices and the
	topology of the PLC network can be visualized via the PANC. The
	recently formed IOTOPS WG in the IETF aims to identify the
	requirements in IoT network management, and operational practices will
	be published. Developers and operators of PLC networks should be able
	to learn operational experiences from this WG.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
	Due to the high accessibility of power grids, PLC might be susceptible
	to eavesdropping within its communication coverage, e.g., one
	apartment tenant may have the chance to monitor the other smart
	meters in the same apartment building. Link-layer security mechanisms, 
	such as payload encryption and device authentication, 
	are designed in the PLC technologies mentioned in this document. 
	Additionally, an on-path malicious PLC device could eavesdrop or modify 
	packets sent through it if appropriate confidentiality and integrity 
	mechanisms are not implemented.
      </t>

      <t>
	Malicious PLC devices could paralyze the whole network via DoS
	attacks, e.g., keep joining and leaving the network frequently or
	sending multicast routing messages containing fake metrics. A device
	may also inadvertently join a wrong or even malicious network,
	exposing its data to malicious users. When communicating with a device
	outside the PLC network, the traffic has to go through the PANC. Thus,
	the PANC must be a trusted entity. Moreover, the PLC network must
	prevent malicious devices from joining the network. Thus, mutual
	authentication of a PLC network and a new device is important, and it
	can be conducted during the onboarding process of the new
	device. Methods include protocols such as the TLS/DTLS Profile <xref target="RFC7925"
	format="default"/> (exchanging pre-installed certificates over DTLS),
	the Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP) <xref target="RFC9031" format="default"/> (which uses pre-shared
	keys), and Zero-Touch Secure Join <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join"
	format="default"/> (an IoT version of the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI), which uses an Initial
	Device Identifier (IDevID) and a Manufacturer Authorized Signing
	Authority (MASA) service to facilitate authentication). It is also
	possible to use Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods such
	as the one defined in <xref target="RFC9140" format="default"/> via transports like
	Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) <xref
	target="RFC5191" format="default"/>. No specific mechanism is
	specified by this document, as an appropriate mechanism will depend
	upon deployment circumstances. In some cases, the PLC devices can be
	deployed in uncontrolled places, where the devices may be accessed
	physically and be compromised via key extraction. The compromised
	device may be still able to join in the network since its credentials
	are still valid. When group-shared symmetric keys are used in the
	network, the consequence is even more severe, i.e., the whole network
	or a large part of the network is at risk. Thus, in scenarios where
	physical attacks are considered to be relatively highly possible,
	per-device credentials <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used. Moreover,
	additional end-to-end security services are complementary to the
	network-side security mechanisms, e.g., if a device is compromised and
	has joined in the network, and then it claims itself as the PANC and
	tries to make the rest of the devices join its network. In this
	situation, the real PANC can send an alarm to the operator to
	acknowledge the risk.  Other behavior-analysis mechanisms can be
	deployed to recognize the malicious PLC devices by inspecting the
	packets and the data.
      </t>
      <t>
	IP addresses may be used to track devices on the Internet; such
	devices can often in turn be linked to individuals and their
	activities.  Depending on the application and the actual use pattern,
	this may be undesirable.  To impede tracking, globally unique and
	non-changing characteristics of IP addresses should be avoided, e.g.,
	by frequently changing the global prefix and avoiding unique
	link-layer derived IIDs in addresses. <xref target="RFC8065"
	format="default"/> discusses the privacy threats when an IID is generated without sufficient entropy, including
	correlation of activities over time, location tracking,
	device-specific vulnerability exploitation, and address scanning. And
	an effective way to deal with these threats is to have enough entropy
	in the IID compared to the link lifetime.  Consider a PLC network
	with 1024 devices and a link lifetime is 8 years, according to
	the formula in <xref target="RFC8065" format="default"/>, an entropy
	of 40 bits is sufficient.  Padding the short address (12 or 16 bits)
	to generate the IID of a routable IPv6 address in the public network
	may be vulnerable to deal with address scans.  Thus, as suggested in
	<xref target="slaac"/>, a hash function can be used to generate a 64-bit
	IID.  When the version number of the PLC network is changed, the
	IPv6 addresses can be changed as well.  Other schemes such as limited
	lease period in DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/>,
	Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) <xref target="RFC3972"
	format="default"/>, Temporary Address Extensions <xref
	target="RFC8981" format="default"/>, Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs) <xref
	target="RFC5535" format="default"/>, or semantically opaque addresses
	<xref target="RFC7217" format="default"/> <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
	used to enhance the IID privacy.
