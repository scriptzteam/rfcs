      <t>
        Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local
        Area Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided
        into multiple segments.  Each segment may be located at a
        different site, and the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS
        backbone.  Intra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always
        appears to the end users to be bridged, even when it is actually
        carried over the IP or MPLS backbone.  When a single tenant owns
        multiple such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed
        between those LANs.  This document specifies new procedures that
        allow inter-subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs
        of a given tenant while still making intra-subnet IP multicast
        traffic appear to be bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal
        routing of the inter-subnet multicast traffic and do not require
        any such traffic to egress a given router and then ingress that same
        router.  These procedures also accommodate IP multicast traffic that
        originates or is destined to be external to the EVPN domain.

            one of the PEs attached to the segment becomes that EVI's DF for
            that segment.  Since a BD may belong to only one EVI, we can
            speak unambiguously of the BD's DF for a given segment.

          Ethernet VPN (EVPN) <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/> provides a Layer 2
          VPN (L2VPN) solution, which allows an IP or MPLS backbone provider to offer
          Ethernet service to a set of customers, known as "tenants".
        </t>
        <t>
          In this section (as well as in <xref target="RFC9135" format="default"/>), we
          provide some essential background information on EVPN.
        </t>
        <section anchor="intro_bd" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Segments, Broadcast Domains, and Tenants</name>
          <t>
            One of the key concepts of EVPN is the Broadcast Domain (BD).  A
            BD is essentially an emulated Ethernet.  Each BD belongs to a
            single tenant.  A BD typically consists of multiple Ethernet
            segments, and each segment may be attached to a different EVPN
            Provider Edge (EVPN PE) router.  EVPN PE routers are
            often referred to as "Network Virtualization Endpoints (NVEs)".
            However, this document will use the term "EVPN PE" or,
            when the context is clear, just "PE".
          </t>
          <t>
            In this document, the term "segment" is used interchangeably with
			"Ethernet Segment" or "ES", as defined in <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Attached to each segment are Tenant Systems (TSs).  A TS may
            be any type of system, physical or virtual, host or router,
            etc., that can attach to an Ethernet.
          </t>
          <t>
            When two TSs are on the same segment, traffic between them does
            not pass through an EVPN PE.  When two TSs are on
            different segments of the same BD, traffic between them does
            pass through an EVPN PE.
          </t>
          <t>
            When two TSs, say TS1 and TS2, are on the same BD, then the following occurs:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>
                If TS1 knows the Media Access Control (MAC) address of TS2, TS1 can send unicast
                Ethernet frames to TS2.  TS2 will receive the frames
                unaltered.
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
                If TS1 broadcasts an Ethernet frame, TS2 will receive the
                unaltered frame.
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
                If TS1 multicasts an Ethernet frame, TS2 will receive the
                unaltered frame as long as TS2 has been provisioned to
                receive the Ethernet multicast destination MAC address.
              </t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
            When we say that TS2 receives an unaltered frame from TS1, we
            mean that the frame still contains TS1's MAC address and that
            no alteration of the frame's payload (and consequently, no
            alteration of the payload's IP header) has been made.
          </t>
          <t>
            EVPN allows a single segment to be attached to multiple PE
            routers.  This is known as "EVPN multihoming". Suppose a
            given segment is attached to both PE1 and PE2, and suppose PE1
            receives a frame from that segment.  It may be necessary for PE1
            to send the frame over the backbone to PE2.  EVPN has procedures
            to ensure that such a frame cannot be sent back to its
            originating segment by PE2.  This is particularly important for
            multicast, because a frame arriving at PE1 from a given segment
            will already have been seen by all the systems on that segment
            that need to see it. If the frame was sent back to the
            originating segment by PE2, receivers on that segment would
            receive the packet twice. Even worse, the frame might be sent
            back to PE1, which could cause an infinite loop.
          </t>

        <section anchor="inter_bd" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Inter-BD (Inter-Subnet) IP Traffic</name>
          <t>
            If a given tenant has multiple BDs, the tenant may wish to allow
            IP communication among these BDs.  Such a set of BDs is known as
            an "EVPN Tenant Domain" or just a "Tenant Domain".
          </t>
          <t>
            If tenant systems TS1 and TS2 are not in the same BD, then they
            do not receive unaltered Ethernet frames from each other.  In
            order for TS1 to send traffic to TS2, TS1 encapsulates an IP
            datagram inside an Ethernet frame and uses Ethernet to send
            these frames to an IP router.  The router decapsulates the IP
            datagram, does the IP processing, and re-encapsulates the
            datagram for Ethernet.  The MAC Source Address field now has the
            MAC address of the router, not of TS1. The TTL field of the IP
            datagram should be decremented by exactly 1, even if the frame
            needs to be sent from one PE to another.  The structure of the
            provider's backbone is thus hidden from the tenants.
          </t>
          <t>
            EVPN accommodates the need for inter-BD communication
            within a Tenant Domain by providing an integrated L2/L3 service
            for unicast IP traffic.  EVPN's Integrated Routing and Bridging
            (IRB) functionality is specified in <xref target="RFC9135" format="default"/>.
            Each BD in a Tenant Domain is assumed to be a single IP subnet,
            and each IP subnet within a given Tenant Domain is assumed to
            be a single BD.  EVPN's IRB functionality allows IP traffic to
            travel from one BD to another and ensures that proper IP
            processing (e.g., TTL decrement) is done.
          </t>
          <t>
            A brief overview of IRB, including the notion of an IRB
            interface, can be found in <xref target="irb" format="default"/>.  As explained
            there, an IRB interface is a sort of virtual interface
            connecting an L3 routing instance to a BD.  A BD may have
            multiple Attachment Circuits (ACs) to a given PE, where each AC
            connects to a different Ethernet segment of the BD.  However,

        <name>Need for EVPN-Aware Multicast Procedures</name>
        <t>
          Inter-subnet IP multicast among a set of BDs can be achieved,
          in a non-optimal manner, without any specific EVPN
          procedures.  For instance, if a particular tenant has n BDs among
          which it wants to send IP multicast traffic, it can simply attach
          a conventional multicast router to all n BDs.  Or more generally,
          as long as each BD has at least one IP multicast router, and the
          IP multicast routers communicate multicast control information
          with each other, conventional IP multicast procedures will work
          normally, and no special EVPN functionality is needed.
        </t>
        <t>
          However, that technique does not provide optimal routing for
          multicast.  In conventional multicast routing, for a given
          multicast flow, there is only one multicast router on each BD that
          is permitted to send traffic of that flow to the BD.  If that BD
          has receivers for a given flow, but the source of the flow is not
          on that BD, then the flow must pass through that multicast router.
          This leads to the hairpinning problem described (for
          unicast) in <xref target="irb" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, consider an (S,G) flow that is sourced by a TS S and
          needs to be received by TSs R1 and R2.  Suppose S is on a segment
          of BD1, R1 is on a segment of BD2, but both are attached to PE1.
          Also suppose that the tenant has a multicast router attached to a
          segment of BD1 and to a segment of BD2.  However, the segments to
          which that router is attached are both attached to PE2.  Then, the
          flow from S to R would have to follow the path:
          S--&gt;PE1--&gt;PE2--&gt;tenant multicast router--&gt;PE2--&gt;PE1--&gt;R1.
          Obviously, the path S--&gt;PE1--&gt;R would be preferred.

        <t>
          Now suppose that there is a second receiver, R2.  R2 is attached
          to a third BD, BD3.  However, it is attached to a segment of BD3
          that is attached to PE1.  And suppose that the tenant
          multicast router is attached to a segment of BD3 that attaches to
          PE2.  In this case, the tenant multicast router will make two
          copies of the packet, one for BD2 and one for BD3.  PE2 will send
          both copies back to PE1.  Not only is the routing sub-optimal, but
          PE2 also sends multiple copies of the same packet to PE1, which is a
          further sub-optimality.
        </t>
        <t>
          This is only an example; many more examples of sub-optimal
          multicast routing can easily be given.  To eliminate sub-optimal
          routing and extra copies, it is necessary to have a multicast
          solution that is EVPN-aware and that can use its knowledge of the
          internal structure of a Tenant Domain to ensure that multicast
          traffic gets routed optimally. The procedures in this document
          allow us to avoid all such sub-optimalities when routing
          inter-subnet multicast traffic within a Tenant Domain.

              The solution must integrate well with the procedures specified

                  If a source and a receiver are on the same subnet, the MAC
                  Source Address (SA) of the multicast frame sent by the
                  source will not get rewritten.

              <li>
                <t>
                  If a source and a receiver are on the same subnet, no IP
                  processing of the Ethernet payload is done.  The IP TTL is
                  not decremented, the IPv4 header checksum is not changed, no

              On the other hand, if a source and a receiver are on different

              MAC Source Address of the source, as the frame will appear to
              have come from a multicast router.  Also, proper processing of
              the IP header is done, e.g., TTL decrements by 1, header
              checksum modification, possible fragmentation, etc.

              If two EVPN PEs attached to the same Tenant Domain both

            <t>
              This presupposes that unicast routes to multicast sources

              attached to the domain and that unicast routes to multicast

          Consider a Tenant Domain consisting of a set of k BDs:
          BD1, ..., BDk.  To support the OISM procedures, each
          Tenant Domain must also be associated with a Supplementary
          Broadcast Domain (SBD).  An SBD is treated in the control plane
          as a real BD, but it does not have any ACs.  The SBD has several

          Each PE that attaches to one or more of the BDs in a given Tenant

          a PE will only be attached to a subset of the BDs in a given
          Tenant Domain and will be configured only with that subset of

          Once PE1 determines that it has an AC that is interested in

		  <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/> to advertise that interest.
          </t>
          <t>
          Note that each IMET or SMET route is for a particular BD.  The
          notion of a route being for a particular BD is explained in

          When OISM is being supported, the procedures of <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/> are modified as follows:

              The IMET route originated by a particular PE for a particular

              Domain containing that BD, even to those PEs that are not
              attached to that particular BD.

              <t>
              The SMET routes originated by a particular PE are originated
              on a per-Tenant-Domain basis rather than a per-BD basis.
              That is, the SMET routes are considered to be for the Tenant
              Domain's SBD rather than any of its ordinary BDs. These

          It is possible that PE1 will receive both an IMET route
          for BD1 and an IMET route for BD2 from PE2.  If either of these IMET routes

          Suppose PE1 has an AC to a segment in BD1 and PE1 receives an (S,G) multicast frame  from

          There may be other ACs of PE1 on which TSs have indicated an

          is responsible for sending the received multicast packet on those
          ACs.  There are two cases to consider:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>
              Intra-Subnet Forwarding: In this case, an AC with
              interest in (S,G) is connected to a segment that is part of
              the source BD, BD1.  If the segment is not multihomed,
              or if PE1 is the Designated Forwarder (DF) (see <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>) for that segment, PE1 sends the multicast
              frame on that AC without changing the MAC SA. The IP header is
              not modified at all; in particular, the TTL is not
              decremented.
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
              Inter-Subnet Forwarding: An AC with interest in (S,G) is
              connected to a segment of BD2, where BD2 is different than
              BD1.  If PE1 is the DF for that segment (or if the segment is
              not multihomed), PE1 decapsulates the IP multicast
              packet, performs any necessary IP processing (including TTL
              decrement), and then re-encapsulates the packet appropriately for
              BD2.  PE1 then sends the packet on the AC.  Note that after
              re-encapsulation, the MAC SA will be PE1's MAC address on BD2.
              The IP TTL will have been decremented by 1.

            </li>

          In addition, there may be other PEs that are interested in (S,G)
          traffic.  Suppose PE2 is such a PE.  Then, PE1 tunnels a copy of
          the IP multicast frame (with its original MAC SA and with no
          alteration of the payload's IP header) to PE2. The tunnel
          encapsulation contains information that PE2 can use to associate
          the frame with an apparent source BD.  If the actual source BD
          of the frame is BD1, then:

            <li>

              If PE2 is attached to BD1, the tunnel encapsulation used to
              send the frame to PE2 will cause PE2 to identify BD1 as the
              apparent source BD.  
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
              If PE2 is not attached to BD1, the tunnel encapsulation used
              to send the frame to PE2 will cause PE2 to identify the SBD as
              the apparent source BD.
              </t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
          Note that the tunnel encapsulation used for a particular BD
          will have been advertised in an IMET route or a Selective
          Provider Multicast Service Interface (S-PMSI) route <xref
          target="RFC9572" format="default"/> for that BD.  That route
          carries a PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA), which specifies how packets
          originating from that BD are encapsulated. This information
          enables the PE receiving a tunneled packet to identify the
          apparent source BD as stated above. See <xref
          target="adv_tunnels" format="default"/> for more details.
          </t>
          <t>
          When PE2 receives the tunneled frame, it will forward it on any of
          its ACs that have interest in (S,G).
          </t>
          <t>
         If PE2 determines from the tunnel encapsulation that the apparent
         source BD is BD1, then:

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>
              For those ACs that connect PE2 to BD1, the intra-subnet
              forwarding procedure described above is used, except that it
              is now PE2, not PE1, carrying out that procedure.  Unmodified
              EVPN procedures from <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/> are used to
              ensure that a packet originating from a multihomed
              segment is never sent back to that segment.

            <li>
              <t>
             For those ACs that do not connect to BD1, the inter-subnet

            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
          If the tunnel encapsulation identifies the apparent source BD as
          the SBD, PE2 applies the inter-subnet forwarding procedures
          described above to all of its ACs that have interest in the flow.
          </t>
          <t>
         These procedures ensure that an IP multicast frame travels from its
         ingress PE to all egress PEs that are interested in receiving
         it. While in transit, the frame retains its original MAC SA, and
         the payload of the frame retains its original IP header.  Note that
         in all cases, when an IP multicast packet is sent from one BD to
         another, these procedures cause its TTL to be decremented by 1.
          </t>
          <t>
         So far, we have assumed that an IP multicast packet arrives at its
         ingress PE over an AC that belongs to one of the BDs in a given
         Tenant Domain.  However, it is possible for a packet to arrive at
         its ingress PE in other ways.  Since an EVPN PE supporting IRB
         has an IP-VRF, it is possible that the IP-VRF will have a
         VRF interface that is not an IRB interface.  For example, there
         might be a VRF interface that is actually a physical link to an
         external Ethernet switch, a directly attached host, or a
         router.  When an EVPN PE, say PE1, receives a packet through
         such means, we will say that the packet has an external source
         (i.e., a source outside the Tenant Domain).  There are also other
         scenarios in which a multicast packet might have an external
         source, e.g., it might arrive over an MVPN tunnel from an L3VPN
         PE. In such cases, we will still refer to PE1 as the "ingress
         EVPN PE".
          </t>
          <t>
         When an EVPN PE, say PE1, receives an externally sourced
         multicast packet, and there are receivers for that packet inside
         the Tenant Domain, it does the following:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>
             Suppose PE1 has an AC in BD1 that has interest in (S,G).  Then,
             PE1 encapsulates the packet for BD1, filling in the MAC SA
             field with PE1's own MAC address on BD1.  It sends the
             resulting frame on the AC.
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
             Suppose some other EVPN PE, say PE2, has interest in
             (S,G).  PE1 encapsulates the packet for Ethernet, filling in
             the MAC SA field with PE1's own MAC address on the SBD. PE1
             then tunnels the packet to PE2.  The tunnel encapsulation will
             identify the apparent source BD as the SBD.  Since the apparent
             source BD is the SBD, PE2 will know to treat the frame as an
             inter-subnet multicast.

          </ul>
          <t>
         When IR is used to transmit IP multicast frames
         from an ingress EVPN PE to a set of egress PEs, then
         the ingress PE has to send multiple copies of the frame.  Each copy
         is the original Ethernet frame; decapsulation and IP processing
         take place only at the egress PE.
          </t>
          <t>
          If a P2MP tree or Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) <xref target="RFC9624" format="default"/> is used to transmit an IP multicast frame
          from an ingress PE to a set of egress PEs, then the ingress PE
          only has to send one copy of the frame to each of its next hops.
          Again, each egress PE receives the original frame and does any
          necessary IP processing.

            A given PE has one IRB interface for each BD to which it is attached.
            This IRB interface connects L3 routing to that BD.  When
            IP multicast packets are sent or received on the IRB interfaces,
            the semantics of the interface are modified from the semantics
            described in <xref target="irb" format="default"/>.  See <xref target="ingress_irb_use" format="default"/> for the details of the modification.

        EVPN supports service models in which a given EVI

        In this document, we frequently say that a particular multicast
        route is "from" or "for" a particular BD or is "related to" or
        "associated with" a particular BD.  These terms are used
        interchangeably.  Subsequent sections of this document explain when
        various routes must be originated for particular BDs.  In this
        section, we explain how the PE originating a route marks the route
        to indicate which BD it is for.  We also explain how a PE
        receiving the route determines which BD the route is for.

        In EVPN, each BD is assigned an RT.  An RT is a BGP
        Extended Community that can be attached to the BGP routes used by
        the EVPN control plane.  In some EVPN service models, each BD is
        assigned a unique RT.  In other service models, a set of BDs (all in
        the same EVI) may be assigned the same RT.  The RT that is assigned
        to the SBD is called the "SBD-RT".
        </t>
        <t>
        In those service models that allow a set of BDs to share a single
        RT, each BD is assigned a non-zero Tag ID.  The Tag ID appears
        in the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of many of the
        BGP routes that are used by the EVPN control plane.

        A given route may be for the SBD or an ordinary BD (a BD

         This allows all PEs to check that they have consistent SBD provisioning

        When receiving an IMET, SMET, S-PMSI, or Leaf route, it is necessary
        for the receiving PE to determine the BD to which the route belongs.
        This is done by examining the RTs carried by the route, as well as
        the Tag ID field of the route's NLRI.  There are several cases to
        consider.  Some of these cases are error cases that arise when the

        cases are only detectable by EVPN procedures at the receiving PE;
        BGP procedures at intermediate nodes will generally not detect the

            The receiving PE recognizes one of the route's RTs as being
            associated with an ordinary BD in a particular Tenant Domain
            and recognizes another of the route's RTs as being associated
            with the SBD of a different Tenant Domain.

          </li>
          <li>

            The receiving PE does not recognize any of the route's RTs as
            being associated with an ordinary BD in any of its Tenant
            Domains but does recognize one of the RTs as the SBD-RT
            of one of its Tenant Domains.
            </t>
            <t>
            In this case, the receiving PE associates the route with the SBD of
            that Tenant Domain. This association is made even if the Tag ID
            field of the route's NLRI is not the Tag ID of the SBD.
            </t>
            <t>
            This is a normal use case where either (a) the route is for a BD
            to which the receiving PE is not attached or (b) the route is
            for the SBD.  In either case, the receiving PE associates the
            route with the SBD.

          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
            The receiving PE recognizes exactly one of the RTs as an
            ordinary BD-RT that is associated with one of the PE's
            EVIs, say EVI-1.  The receiving PE also recognizes one of
            the RTs as being the SBD-RT of the Tenant Domain containing
            EVI-1.
            </t>
            <t>
            In this case, the route is associated with the BD in EVI-1
            that is identified (in the context of EVI-1) by the Tag ID
            field of the route's NLRI.  (If EVI-1 contains only a
            single BD, the Tag ID is likely to be zero.)
            </t>
            <t>
            This is the case where the route is for a BD to which the
            receiving PE is attached, but the route also carries the
            SBD-RT.  In this case, the receiving PE associates the route
            with the ordinary BD, not with the SBD.

        </ol>
        <t>
        Note that according to the above rules, the mapping from BD to RT is a
        many-to-one or one-to-one mapping.  A route that an EVPN PE
        originates for a particular BD carries that BD's RT, and an
        EVPN PE that receives the route associates it with a BD as
        described above.  However, RTs are not used only to help identify
        the BD to which a route belongs; they may also be used by BGP to
        determine the path along which the route is distributed and to
        determine which PEs receive the route.  There may be cases where it
        is desirable to originate a route for a particular BD  but have
        that route distributed to only some of the EVPN PEs attached to
        that BD.  Or one might want the route distributed to some
        intermediate set of systems, where it might be modified or replaced
        before being propagated further.  Such situations are outside the
        scope of this document.

        Additionally, there may be situations where it is desirable to

        <name>Use of IRB Interfaces at Ingress PE</name>
        <t>
        When an (S,G) multicast frame is received from an AC belonging to a
        particular BD, say BD1:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li anchor="inter-PE">
            <t>
            The frame is sent unchanged to other EVPN PEs that are
            interested in (S,G) traffic.  The encapsulation used to send the
            frame to the other EVPN PEs depends on the tunnel type
            being used for multicast transmission. (For our purposes, we
            consider IR, AR, and
            BIER to be tunnel types, even though IR, AR, and BIER do not
            actually use P2MP tunnels.)  At the egress PE, the apparent
            source BD of the frame can be inferred from the tunnel
            encapsulation.  If the egress PE is not attached to the actual
            source BD, it will infer that the apparent source BD is the SBD.
            </t>
            <t>
            Note that the inter-PE transmission of a multicast
            frame among EVPN PEs of the same Tenant Domain does NOT
            involve the IRB interfaces as long as the multicast frame was
            received over an AC attached to one of the Tenant Domain's BDs.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li anchor="up_IRB">
            <t>
            The frame is also sent up the IRB interface that attaches BD1 to
            the Tenant Domain's L3 routing instance in this PE.  That is,
            the L3 routing instance, behaving as if it were a multicast
            router, receives the IP multicast frames that arrive at the PE
            from its local ACs.  The L3 routing instance decapsulates the
            frame's payload to extract the IP multicast packet, decrements
            the IP TTL, adjusts the header checksum, and does any other
            necessary IP processing (e.g., fragmentation).
            </t>
          </li>
          <li anchor="down_IRB">
            <t>
            The L3 routing instance keeps track of which BDs have local
            receivers for (S,G) traffic.  (A local receiver is a TS,
            reachable via a local AC, that has expressed interest in (S,G)
            traffic.)  If the L3 routing instance has an IRB interface to
            BD2, and it knows that BD2 has a LOCAL receiver interested in
            (S,G) traffic, it encapsulates the packet in an Ethernet header
            for BD2, putting its own MAC address in the MAC SA field.  Then,
            it sends the packet down the IRB interface to BD2.
            </t>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
        If a packet is sent from the L3 routing instance to a particular
        BD via the IRB interface (step <xref target="down_IRB" format="counter"/> in the above list), and if the BD in question is
        NOT the SBD, the packet is sent ONLY to LOCAL ACs of that BD.  If
        the packet needs to go to other PEs, it has already been sent to
        them in step <xref target="inter-PE" format="counter"/>. Note that
        this is a change in the IRB interface semantics from what is
        described in <xref target="RFC9135" format="default"/> and <xref target="IRB" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
        If a given locally attached segment is multihomed, existing EVPN
        procedures ensure that a packet is not sent by a given PE to that
        segment unless the PE is the DF for that segment. Those procedures
        also ensure that a packet is never sent by a PE to its segment of
        origin.  Thus, EVPN segment multihoming is fully supported;
        duplicate delivery to a segment or looping on a segment are thereby
        prevented without the need for any new procedures to be defined in
        this document.
        </t>
        <t>
        What if an IP multicast packet is received from outside the Tenant
        Domain?  For instance, perhaps PE1's IP-VRF for a particular
        Tenant Domain also has a physical interface leading to an external
        switch, host, or router and PE1 receives an IP multicast packet or
        frame on that interface, or perhaps the packet is from an L3VPN or
        a different EVPN Tenant Domain.
        </t>
        <t>
        Such a packet is first processed by the L3 routing instance, which
        decrements TTL and does any other necessary IP processing.  Then, the
        packet is sent into the Tenant Domain by sending it down the IRB
        interface to the SBD of that Tenant Domain.  This requires
        encapsulating the packet in an Ethernet header.  The MAC SA field
        will contain the PE's own MAC on the SBD.
        </t>
        <t>
        An IP multicast packet sent by the L3 routing instance down the IRB
        interface to the SBD is treated as if it had arrived from a local
        AC, and steps <xref target="inter-PE" format="counter"/>-<xref target="down_IRB" format="counter"/> are applied.  Note that the
        semantics of sending a packet down the IRB interface to the SBD are
        thus slightly different than the semantics of sending a packet down
        other IRB interfaces.  IP multicast packets sent down the SBD's IRB
        interface may be distributed to other PEs, but IP multicast packets
        sent down other IRB interfaces are distributed only to local ACs.
        </t>
        <t>
        If a PE sends a link-local multicast packet down the SBD IRB
        interface, that packet will be distributed (as an Ethernet frame) to
        other PEs of the Tenant Domain but will not appear on any of the
        actual BDs.

        <name>Use of IRB Interfaces at an Egress PE</name>
        <t>
        Suppose an egress EVPN PE receives an (S,G) multicast frame
        from the frame's ingress EVPN PE.  As described above, the
        packet will arrive as an Ethernet frame over a tunnel from the
        ingress PE, and the tunnel encapsulation will identify the source BD
        of the Ethernet frame.
        </t>
        <t>
        We define the notion of the frame's apparent source BD as follows.
        If the egress PE is attached to the actual source BD, the actual
        source BD is the apparent source BD.  If the egress PE is not
        attached to the actual source BD, the SBD is the apparent source BD.
        </t>
        <t>
        The egress PE now takes the following steps:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
            <t>
            If the egress PE has ACs belonging to the apparent source BD of
            the frame, it sends the frame unchanged to any ACs of that BD
            that have interest in (S,G) packets.  The MAC SA of the frame is
            not modified, and the IP header of the frame's payload is not
            modified in any way.

          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
            The frame is also sent to the L3 routing instance by being sent

        <name>Announcing Interest in (S,G)</name>
        <t>
        <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/> defines procedures used by an egress PE
        to announce its interest in a multicast flow or set of flows.  If an
        egress PE determines it has LOCAL receivers in a particular BD, say
        BD1, that are interested in a particular set of flows, it originates
        one or more SMET routes for BD1.  Each SMET route specifies a
        particular (S,G) or (*,G) flow.  By originating a SMET route for
        BD1, a PE is announcing "I have receivers for (S,G) or (*,G) in
        BD1".  Such a SMET route carries the RT for BD1,
        ensuring that it will be distributed to all PEs that are attached to
        BD1.
        </t>
        <t>
        The OISM procedures for originating SMET routes differ slightly from
        those in <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>.  In most cases, the SMET
        routes are considered to be for the SBD rather than the BD
        containing local receivers.  These SMET routes carry the
        SBD-RT and do not carry any ordinary BD-RT.  Details on the
        processing of SMET routes can be found in <xref target="smet_adv" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
        Since the SMET routes carry the SBD-RT, every ingress PE attached to
        a particular Tenant Domain will learn of all other PEs (attached to
        the same Tenant Domain) that have interest in a particular set of
        flows. Note that a PE that receives a given SMET route does not
        necessarily have any BDs (other than the SBD) in common with the PE
        that originates that SMET route.

        <t>
        If all the sources and receivers for a given (*,G) are in the Tenant
        Domain, inter-subnet ASM traffic will be
        properly routed without requiring any RPs, shared
        trees, or other complex aspects of multicast routing infrastructure.
        Suppose, for example, that:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>
            PE1 has a local receiver, on BD1, for (*,G) and

            PE2 has a local source, on BD2, for (*,G).
            </t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
        PE1 will originate a SMET(*,G) route for the SBD, and PE2 will
        receive that route, even if PE2 is not attached to BD1.  PE2 will
        thus know to forward (S,G) traffic to PE1.  PE1 does not need to do
        any source discovery.  (This does assume that source S does not
        send the same (S,G) datagram on two different BDs and that the
        Tenant Domain does not contain two or more sources with the same IP
        address S.  The use of multicast sources that have IP anycast
        addresses is outside the scope of this document.)
        </t>
        <t>
        If some PE attached to the Tenant Domain does not support
        <xref target="RFC9251"/>, it will be assumed to be interested in all flows.
        Whether a particular remote PE supports <xref target="RFC9251"/> or not is determined
        by the presence of the Multicast Flags Extended Community

        <t>
        <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/> specifies the procedures for setting up and
        using BUM tunnels.  A BUM tunnel is a tunnel used to carry traffic
        on a particular BD if that traffic is (a) broadcast traffic, (b)
        unicast traffic with an unknown Destination MAC Address, or (c) Ethernet multicast
        traffic.
        </t>
        <t>
        This document allows the BUM tunnels to be used as the default
        tunnels for transmitting IP multicast frames.  It also allows a
        separate set of tunnels to be used, instead of the BUM tunnels, as
        the default tunnels for carrying IP multicast frames.  Let's call
        these "IP multicast tunnels".
        </t>
        <t>
        When the tunneling is done via IR or via BIER, this
        difference is of no significance.  However, when P2MP tunnels are
        used, there is a significant advantage to having separate IP
        multicast tunnels.
        </t>
        <t>
        It is desirable for an ingress PE to
        transmit a copy of a given (S,G) multicast frame on only one P2MP
        tunnel.  All egress PEs interested in (S,G) packets then have to
        join that tunnel. If the source BD and PE for an (S,G) frame are
        BD1 and PE1, respectively, and if PE2 has receivers on BD2 for (S,G),
        then PE2 must join the P2MP Label Switched Path (LSP) on which PE1 transmits the (S,G)
        frame.  PE2 must join this P2MP LSP even if PE2 is not attached to
        the source BD, BD1.  If PE1 was transmitting the multicast frame
        on its BD1 BUM tunnel, then PE2 would have to join the BD1 BUM
        tunnel, even though PE2 has no BD1 Attachment Circuits.  This would
        cause PE2 to pull all the BUM traffic from BD1, most of which it
        would just have to discard.  Thus, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the default IP
        multicast tunnels be distinct from the BUM tunnels.
        </t>
        <t>
        Notwithstanding the above, link-local IP multicast traffic <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        always be carried on the BUM tunnels and ONLY on the BUM tunnels.
        Link-local IP multicast traffic consists of IPv4 traffic with a
        destination address prefix of 224/24 and IPv6 traffic with a
        destination address prefix of FF02/16.  In this document, the terms
        "IP multicast packet" and "IP multicast frame" are defined in <xref target="terminology" format="default"/> so as to exclude link-local traffic.

        <t>
        Note that it is also possible to use selective tunnels to carry
        particular multicast flows (see <xref target="adv_tunnels" format="default"/>).  When
        an (S,G) frame is transmitted on a selective tunnel, it is not
        transmitted on the BUM tunnel or on the default IP multicast tunnel.

          As discussed in <xref target="sbd_intro" format="default"/>, every Tenant Domain is
          associated with a single
          SBD. Recall that a Tenant Domain is defined to be a set of BDs
          that can freely send and receive IP multicast traffic to/from each
          other. If an EVPN PE has one or more ACs in a BD of a
          particular Tenant Domain, and if the EVPN PE supports the
          procedures of this document, that EVPN PE <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provisioned
          with the SBD of that Tenant Domain.
        </t>
        <t>
          At each EVPN PE attached to a given Tenant Domain, there is
          an IRB interface leading from the L3 routing instance of that
          Tenant Domain to the SBD.  However, the SBD has no ACs.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each SBD is provisioned with an RT.  All the
          EVPN PEs supporting a given SBD are provisioned with that RT
          as an import RT.  That RT <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be the same as the RT
          associated with any other BD.
        </t>
        <t>
          We will use the term "SBD-RT" to denote the RT that has been
          assigned to the SBD.  Routes carrying this RT will be propagated
          to all EVPN PEs in the same Tenant Domain as the originator.

          <xref target="bd_route" format="default"/> specifies the rules by which an
          EVPN PE that receives a route determines whether a received
          route belongs to a particular ordinary BD or SBD.
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="bd_route" format="default"/> also specifies additional rules that
          must be followed when constructing routes that belong to a
          particular BD, including the SBD.
        </t>
        <t>
          The SBD <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be in an EVI of its own. Even if
          the SBD is not in an EVI of its own, the SBD-RT <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
          different than the RT associated with any other BD.  This
          restriction is necessary in order for the rules of Sections <xref target="bd_route" format="counter"/> and <xref target="sbd_rts" format="counter"/> to work correctly.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that an SBD, just like any other BD, is associated on each
          EVPN PE with a MAC-VRF.  Per <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>,
          each MAC-VRF is associated with a Route Distinguisher (RD).
          When constructing a route that is for an SBD, an EVPN PE
          will place the RD of the associated MAC-VRF in the Route
          Distinguisher field of the NLRI.  (If the Tenant Domain has
          several MAC-VRFs on a given PE, the EVPN PE has a choice
          of which RD to use.)

        <t>
          If AR <xref target="RFC9574" format="default"/> is
          used, each AR-REPLICATOR for a given Tenant Domain must be

        <name>Advertising the Tunnels Used for IP Multicast</name>
        <t>
          The procedures used for advertising the tunnels that carry IP
          multicast traffic depend upon the type of tunnel being used.  If
          the tunnel type is neither IR, AR,
          nor BIER, there are procedures for advertising both
          inclusive tunnels and selective tunnels.
        </t>
        <t>
          When IR, AR, or BIER are used to transmit IP multicast packets
          across the core, there are no P2MP tunnels.  Once an ingress
          EVPN PE determines the set of egress EVPN PEs for a
          given flow, the IMET routes contain all the information needed to
          transport packets of that flow to the egress PEs.
        </t>
        <t>
          If AR is used, the ingress EVPN PE is also an AR-LEAF,
          and the IMET route coming from the selected AR-REPLICATOR
          contains the information needed. The AR-REPLICATOR will
          behave as an ingress EVPN PE when sending a flow to the
          egress EVPN PEs.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the tunneling technique requires P2MP tunnels to be set up
          (e.g., RSVP-TE P2MP, Multipoint LDP (mLDP), or PIM), some of the tunnels may be
          selective tunnels and some may be inclusive tunnels.
        </t>
        <t>
          Selective P2MP tunnels are always advertised by the ingress PE
          using S-PMSI Auto-Discovery (A-D) routes <xref target="RFC9572" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          For inclusive tunnels, there is a choice between using a BD's
          ordinary BUM tunnel as the default
          inclusive tunnel for carrying IP multicast traffic or using a
          separate IP multicast tunnel as the default inclusive tunnel for
          carrying IP multicast. In the former case, the inclusive tunnel is
          advertised in an IMET route.  In the latter case, the inclusive
          tunnel is advertised in a (C-*,C-*) S-PMSI A-D
          route <xref target="RFC9572" format="default"/>.  Details may be found in

            There are situations in which an EVPN PE needs to originate
            IMET, SMET, and/or S-PMSI routes for the SBD.  Throughout this
            document, we will refer to such routes respectively as
            "SBD-IMET routes", "SBD-SMET routes", and

            When an EVPN PE needs to originate an SBD-IMET,

                0 if a VLAN-based or VLAN-bundle service is

              uniquely, in the context of the originating EVPN PE, to
              the BD in question. These IMET routes need not carry the

              When an ingress EVPN PE needs to use IR to send an IP
              multicast frame from a particular source BD to an egress
              EVPN PE, the ingress PE determines whether or not the egress PE
              has originated an IMET route for that BD.  If so, that IMET
              route contains the MPLS label that the egress PE has assigned
              to the source BD.  The ingress PE uses that label when
              transmitting the packet to the egress PE. Otherwise, the
              ingress PE uses the label that the egress PE has assigned to

                  encapsulation <xref target="RFC8296" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC9624" format="default"/>.  The BIER BitString is set to
                  identify the egress EVPN PEs.  The BIER Proto field
                  is set to the value for "MPLS packet with an
                  upstream-assigned label at top of the stack".
              </t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
              Note: It is possible that the packet being tunneled from PE1
              originated outside the Tenant Domain.  In this case, the
              actual source BD, BD1, is considered to be the SBD, and the
              upstream-assigned label it carries will be the label that
              PE1 assigned to the SBD and advertised in its SBD-IMET
              route.
          </t>
          <t>
              Suppose an egress PE, say PE2, receives such a BIER packet. The
              BFIR-id field of the BIER header allows PE2 to determine
              that the ingress PE is PE1. There are then two cases to
              consider:
          </t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
              <t>
                  PE2 has received and installed an IMET route for BD1 from
                  PE1.
              </t>
              <t>
                  In this case, the BIER packet will be carrying the
                  upstream-assigned label that is specified in the PTA
                  of that IMET route.  This enables PE2 to determine the
                  apparent source BD (as defined in <xref target="egress_irb_use" format="default"/>). 
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
                  PE2 has not received and installed an IMET route for BD1
                  from PE1.
              </t>
              <t>
                  In this case, PE2 will not recognize the
                  upstream-assigned label carried in the BIER
                  packet. PE2 <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> discard the packet.

              In this case, an IP multicast frame (whether inter-subnet

              the BUM tunnel belonging to its source BD.  Each EVPN PE
              attached to a given Tenant Domain needs to join the BUM
              tunnels for every BD in the Tenant Domain, even those BDs to
              which the EVPN PE is not locally attached.  This ensures

          An ingress EVPN PE for a given multicast flow or set of flows

        <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/> allows an egress EVPN PE to express
        its interest in a particular multicast flow or set of flows by
        originating a SMET route.  The NLRI of the SMET route identifies
        the flow or set of flows as (C-*,C-*),
        (C-*,C-G), or (C-S,C-G).
        </t>
        <t>
        Each SMET route belongs to a particular BD.  The Tag ID for the BD
        appears in the NLRI of the route, and the route carries the RT
        associated with that BD.  From this &lt;RT, tag&gt; pair, other
        EVPN PEs can identify the BD to which a received SMET route
        belongs. (Remember though that the route may be carrying multiple
        RTs.)
        </t>
        <t>
        There are three cases to consider:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="Case %d:">
          <li>
            <t>
            It is known that no BD of a Tenant Domain contains a
            multicast router.
            </t>
            <t>
            In this case, an egress PE advertises its interest in a flow or
            set of flows by originating a SMET route that belongs to the
            SBD.  We refer to this as an SBD-SMET route.  The
            SBD-SMET route carries the SBD-RT and has the Tag ID
            for the SBD in its NLRI. SMET routes for the individual BDs are
            not needed, because there is no need for a PE that receives a
            SMET route to send a corresponding IGMP/MLD Join message on any of
            its ACs.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
            It is known that more than one BD of a Tenant Domain may
            contain a multicast router.
            </t>
            <t>
            This is much like Case 1.  An egress PE advertises its interest
            in a flow or set of flows by originating an SBD-SMET route.
            The SBD-SMET route carries the SBD-RT and has the Tag
            ID for the SBD in its NLRI.
            </t>
            <t>
            In this case, it is important to be sure that SMET routes for
            the individual BDs are not originated.  For example, suppose
            that PE1 had local receivers for a given flow on both BD1 and
            BD2 and that it originated SMET routes for both those BDs.
            Then, PEs receiving those SMET routes might send IGMP/MLD Joins on
            both those BDs.  This could cause externally sourced multicast
            traffic to enter the Tenant Domain at both BDs, which could
            result in duplication of data.
            </t>
            <t>
            Note that if it is possible that more than one BD contains a tenant
            multicast router, then in order to receive multicast data
            originating from outside EVPN, the PEs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> follow the
            procedures of <xref target="external" format="default"/>.

          </li>

            <t>
            It is known that only a single BD of a Tenant Domain
            contains a multicast router.
            </t>
            <t>
            Suppose that an egress PE is attached to a BD on which there
            might be a tenant multicast router.  (The tenant router is not
            necessarily on a segment that is attached to that PE.)  And
            suppose that the PE has one or more ACs attached to that BD,
            which are interested in a given multicast flow.  In this case,
            in addition to the SMET route for the SBD, the egress PE <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
            originate a SMET route for that BD.  This will enable the
            ingress PE(s) to send IGMP/MLD messages on ACs for the BD, as
            specified in <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>.  As long as that is
            the only BD on which there is a tenant multicast router, there
            is no possibility of duplication of data.

        This document does not specify procedures for dynamically
        determining which of the three cases applies to a given deployment;
        the PEs of a given Tenant Domain <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provisioned to know which
        case applies.

		As detailed in <xref target="RFC9251"/>, a SMET route carries flags indicating whether IGMP (v1, v2, or v3) or MLD (v1 or v2) messages should be triggered on the ACs of the BD to which the SMET route belongs. For IGMP v3 and MLD v2, the Include/Exclude (IE) flag also indicates whether the source information in the SMET route is of an Include Group type or Exclude Group type. If an SBD PE needs to generate IGMP/MLD reports (as it is the case in <xref target="external_pim_router"/>) or the route is for an (S, G) state, the value of the flags <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set according to the rules in <xref target="RFC9251"/>. Otherwise, the flags <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be set to 0.
        </t>
        <t>
        Note that a PE only needs to originate the set of SBD-SMET
        routes that are needed in order to receive multicast traffic that the PE is
        interested in.  Suppose PE1 has ACs attached to BD1 that are interested
        in (C-*,C-G) traffic and ACs attached to BD2 that are
        interested in (C-S,C-G) traffic.  A single SBD-SMET
        route specifying (C-*,C-G) will attract all the necessary
        flows.
        </t>
        <t>
        As another example, suppose the ACs attached to BD1 are interested
        in (C-*,C-G) but not in (C-S,C-G), while the ACs
        attached to BD2 are interested in (C-S,C-G).  A single
        SBD-SMET route specifying (C-*,C-G) will pull in all
        the necessary flows.
        </t>
        <t>
        In other words, to determine the set of SBD-SMET routes that
        have to be sent for a given C-G, the PE has to merge the
        IGMP/MLD state for all the BDs (of the given Tenant Domain) to which
        it is attached.
        </t>
        <t>
        Per <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>, importing a SMET route for a
        particular BD will cause the IGMP/MLD state to be instantiated for the
        IRB interface to that BD.  This also applies when the BD is the
        SBD.
        </t>
        <t>
        However, traffic that originates in one of the actual BDs of a
        particular Tenant Domain <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be sent down the IRB interface
        that connects the L3 routing instance of that Tenant Domain to the
        SBD.  That would cause duplicate delivery of traffic, since such
        traffic will have already been distributed throughout the Tenant
        Domain.  Therefore, when setting up the IGMP/MLD state based on
        SBD-SMET routes, care must be taken to ensure that the IRB
        interface to the SBD is not added to the Outgoing Interface (OIF)
        list if the traffic originates within the Tenant Domain.
        </t>
        <t>
        There are some multicast scenarios that make use of anycast
        sources.  For example, two different sources may share the same
        anycast IP address, say S1, and each may transmit an (S1,G)
        multicast flow.  In such a scenario, the two (S1,G) flows are
        typically identical.  Ordinary PIM procedures will cause only one of
        the flows to be delivered to each receiver that has expressed
        interest in either (*,G) or (S1,G).  However, the OISM procedures
        described in this document will result in both of the (S1,G) flows
        being distributed in the Tenant Domain, and duplicate delivery will
        result.  Therefore, if there are receivers for (*,G) in a given
        Tenant Domain, there <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be anycast sources for G within that
        Tenant Domain.  (This restriction could be lifted by defining
        additional procedures; however, that is outside the scope of this
        document.)

          An EVPN PE maintains Layer 2 multicast state for each BD to
          which it is attached. Note that this is used for forwarding IP
		  multicast frames based on the inner IP header. The state is
		  learned through IGMP/MLD snooping <xref target="RFC4541" format="default"/>
		  and procedures in this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          Let PE1 be an EVPN PE and BD1 be a BD to which it is
          attached.  At PE1, BD1's Layer 2 multicast state for a given
          (C-S,C-G) or (C-*,C-G) governs the disposition
          of an IP multicast packet that is received by BD1's Layer 2
          multicast function on an EVPN PE.
        </t>
        <t>
           An IP multicast (S,G) packet is considered to have been received
           by BD1's Layer 2 multicast function in PE1 in the following
           cases:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>
                The packet is the payload of an Ethernet frame received by PE1
                from an AC that attaches to BD1.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
                The packet is the payload of an Ethernet frame whose
                apparent source BD is BD1, which is received by the PE1
                over a tunnel from another EVPN PE.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
                The packet is received from BD1's IRB interface (i.e., has
                been transmitted by PE1's L3 routing instance down BD1's IRB
                interface).
            </t>

        <t>
          According to the procedures of this document, all transmissions of
          IP multicast packets from one EVPN PE to another are done at
          Layer 2.  That is, the packets are transmitted as Ethernet frames,
          according to the Layer 2 multicast state.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each Layer 2 multicast state (S,G) or (*,G) contains a set of outgoing
          interfaces (an OIF list).  The disposition of an (S,G) multicast
          frame received by BD1's Layer 2 multicast function is determined
          as follows:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>
              The OIF list is taken from BD1's Layer 2 (S,G) state, or if
              there is no such (S,G) state, then it is taken from BD1's (*,G) state.
              (If neither state exists, the OIF list is considered to be
              null.)

            In this document, we have extended the procedures of <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/> so that IMET and SMET routes for a
            particular BD are distributed not just to PEs that attach to
            that BD but to PEs that attach to any BD in the Tenant Domain.
            In this way, each PE attached to a given Tenant Domain learns,
            from another PE attached to the same Tenant Domain, the set
            of flows that are of interest to each of those other PEs.  (If
            some PE attached to the Tenant Domain does not support <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>, it will be assumed to be interested in
            all flows.  Whether or not a particular remote PE supports <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/> is determined by the presence of an
            Extended Community in its IMET route; this is specified in <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>.)  If a set of remote PEs are interested
            in a particular flow, the tunnels used to reach those PEs are
            added to the OIF list of the multicast states corresponding to
            that flow.

            An EVPN PE may run IGMP/MLD snooping procedures
			<xref target="RFC4541" format="default"/> on each of its ACs
            in order to determine the set of flows of interest to each AC.
            (An AC is said to be interested in a given flow if it connects
            to a segment that has tenant systems interested in that flow.)
            If IGMP/MLD procedures are not being run on a given AC, that AC
            is considered to be interested in all flows.  For each BD, the
            set of ACs interested in a given flow is determined, and the ACs
            of that set are added to the OIF list of that BD's multicast
            state for that flow.
          </t>
          <t>
            The OIF list for each multicast state must also contain the

        <t>
        If an EVPN PE is performing IGMP/MLD procedures on the ACs of a
        given BD, it processes those messages at Layer 2 to help form the
        Layer 2 multicast state.  It also sends those messages up that BD's
        IRB interface to the L3 routing instance of a particular Tenant
        Domain.  This causes the (C-S,C-G) or
        (C-*,C-G) L3 state to be created/updated.
        </t>
        <t>
        A Layer 3 multicast state has both an Input Interface (IIF) and an
        OIF list. 
        </t>
        <t>
        For a (C-S,C-G) state, if the source BD is present on the PE,
		the IIF is set to the IRB
        interface that attaches to that BD.  Otherwise, the IIF is set to the
        SBD IRB interface.
        </t>
      <t>
        For (C-*,C-G) states, traffic can arrive from any BD, so
        the IIF needs to be set to a wildcard value meaning "any IRB
        interface".
        </t>
        <t>
        The OIF list of these states includes one or more of the IRB
        interfaces of the Tenant Domain.  In general, maintenance of the OIF
        list does not require any EVPN-specific procedures.  However, there
        is one EVPN-specific rule:
        </t>
            <t indent="3">
            If the IIF is one of the IRB interfaces (or the wildcard
            meaning "any IRB interface"), then the SBD IRB interface <bcp14>MUST
            NOT</bcp14> be added to the OIF list.  Traffic originating from within a
            particular EVPN Tenant Domain must not be sent down the SBD IRB
            interface, as such traffic has already been distributed to all
            EVPN PEs attached to that Tenant Domain.

    It is possible that a given Tenant Domain will be attached to both OISM
    PEs and non-OISM PEs.  Inter-subnet IP multicast should be
    possible and fully functional even if not all PEs attaching to a Tenant
    Domain can be upgraded to support OISM functionality.
      </t>
      <t>
    Note that the non-OISM PEs are not required to have IRB support or
    support for <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>.  However, it is advantageous for
    the non-OISM PEs to support <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
    In this section, we will use the following terminology:

      <dl spacing="normal" newline="false">
          <dt>PE-S:</dt> <dd>The ingress PE for an (S,G) flow.</dd>

          <dt>BD-S:</dt> <dd>The source BD for an (S,G) flow.  PE-S must have one

          <dt>BD-R:</dt> <dd>A BD that contains a host interested in the flow.  The
        host is attached to PE-R via an AC that belongs to BD-R.</dd>
        </dl>
      <t>
    To allow OISM PEs to interwork with non-OISM PEs, a given Tenant
    Domain needs to contain one or more IP Multicast Gateways (IPMGs). An
    IPMG is an OISM PE with special responsibilities regarding the
    interworking between OISM and non-OISM PEs.
      </t>
      <t>
    If a PE is functioning as an IPMG, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> signal this fact by setting
    the IPMG flag in the Multicast Flags EC that it attaches to its IMET
    routes.  An IPMG <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> attach this EC, with the IPMG flag set, to all
    IMET routes it originates.  Furthermore, if PE1 imports any IMET route from
    PE2 that has the EC present with the IPMG flag set, then the PE1 will
    assume that PE2 is an IPMG.
      </t>
      <t>
    An IPMG Designated Forwarder (IPMG-DF) selection procedure is used
    to ensure that there is exactly one active
    IPMG-DF for any given BD at any given time. Details of the IPMG-DF selection
    procedure are in <xref target="ipmg-df" format="default"/>. The IPMG-DF for a given
    BD, say BD-S, has special functions to perform when it receives
    (S,G) frames on that BD:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>
        If the frames are from a non-OISM PE-S:

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>
            The IPMG-DF forwards them to OISM PEs that do not attach to
            BD-S but have interest in (S,G).
              </t>
              <t>
            Note that OISM PEs that do attach to BD-S will have
            received the frames on the BUM tunnel from the non-OISM
            PE-S.
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
            The IPMG-DF forwards them to non-OISM PEs that have
            interest in (S,G) on ACs that do not belong to BD-S.
              </t>
              <t>
            Note that if a non-OISM PE has multiple BDs (other than
            BD-S) with interest in (S,G), it will receive one copy of
            the frame for each such BD. This is necessary because the
            non-OISM PEs cannot move IP multicast traffic from one BD
            to another.
              </t>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>
          <t>
        If the frames are from an OISM PE, the IPMG-DF forwards them to
        non-OISM PEs that have interest in (S,G) on ACs that do not
        belong to BD-S.
          </t>
          <t>
        If a non-OISM PE has interest in (S,G) on an AC belonging to
        BD-S, it will have received a copy of the (S,G) frame,
        encapsulated for BD-S, from the OISM PE-S (see <xref target="imet-ir" format="default"/>). If the non-OISM PE has interest in (S,G)
        on one or more ACs belonging to BD-R1,...,BD-Rk where the
        BD-Ri are distinct from BD-S, the IPMG-DF needs to
        send it a copy of the frame for each BD-Ri.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
    If an IPMG receives a frame on a BD for which it is not the
    IPMG-DF, it just follows normal OISM procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
    This section specifies several sets of procedures:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>
        the procedures that the IPMG-DF for a given BD needs to follow

        non-OISM PE;
          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
        the procedures that the IPMG-DF for a given BD needs to follow

          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
        the procedures that an OISM PE needs to follow when receiving, on a
        given BD, an IP multicast frame from a non-OISM PE, when the
        OISM PE is not the IPMG-DF for that BD.
          </t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
    To enable OISM/non-OISM interworking in a given Tenant Domain, the
    Tenant Domain <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have some EVPN PEs that can function as IPMGs.
    An IPMG must be configured with the SBD.  It must also be configured
    with every BD of the Tenant Domain that exists on any of the
    non-OISM PEs of that domain.  (Operationally, it may be simpler to
    configure the IPMG with all the BDs of the Tenant Domain.)
      </t>
      <t>
    Of course, a non-OISM PE only needs to be configured with BDs for
    which it has ACs.  An OISM PE that is not an IPMG only needs to be
    configured with the SBD and with the BDs for which it has ACs.
      </t>
      <t>
    An IPMG <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> originate a wildcard SMET route (with (C-*,C-*)
    in the NLRI) for each BD in the Tenant Domain.  This will cause it to
    receive all the IP multicast traffic that is sourced in the Tenant
    Domain. Note that non-OISM nodes that do not support <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/> will send all the multicast traffic from a given
    BD to all PEs attached to that BD, even if those PEs do not originate a
    SMET route.
      </t>
      <t>
    The interworking procedures vary somewhat depending upon whether packets
    are transmitted from PE to PE via IR or via
    P2MP tunnels. In this section, we do not consider the use of BIER
    due to the low likelihood of there being a
    non-OISM PE that supports BIER.

      Every PE that is eligible for selection as an IPMG-DF for a

      SBD-IMET route.  As stated in <xref target="no-OISM" format="default"/>, these
      SBD-IMET routes carry a Multicast Flags EC with the IPMG flag
      set.
        </t>
        <t>
      These SBD-IMET routes <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also carry a DF Election EC.  The DF
      Election EC and its use is specified in <xref target="RFC8584" format="default"/>. When the route is originated, the
      AC-DF bit in the DF Election EC <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be set. This bit
      is not used when selecting an IPMG-DF, i.e., it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored
      by the receiver of an SBD-IMET route.
        </t>
        <t>
      In the context of a given Tenant Domain, to select the IPMG-DF
      for a particular BD, say BD1, the IPMGs of the Tenant Domain perform
      the following procedures:

        <ul spacing="normal">

            <t>
          From the set of received SBD-IMET routes for the given Tenant

          </li>
          <li>

        <t>
      When a non-OISM PE-S transmits a multicast frame from
      BD-S to another PE, say PE-R, PE-S will use the
      encapsulation specified in the BD-S IMET route that was
      originated by PE-R.  This encapsulation will include the label
      that appears in the MPLS Label field of the 
      PTA of the IMET route. If the tunnel type is VXLAN, the label is
      actually a Virtual Network Identifier (VNI); for other tunnel types,
      the label is an MPLS label. In either case, 
      the frames are transmitted with a label that was assigned to a
      particular BD by the PE-R to which the frame is being
      transmitted.
        </t>
        <t>
      To support OISM/non-OISM interworking, an OISM PE-R <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      originate, for each of its BDs, both an IMET route and an (C-*,C-*)
      S-PMSI A-D route.  Note that even when IR is being
      used, interworking between OISM and non-OISM PEs requires the
      OISM PEs to follow the rules of <xref target="wc_spmsi" format="default"/>, as modified
      below.
        </t>
        <t>
      Non-OISM PEs will not understand S-PMSI A-D routes.  So
      when a non-OISM PE-S transmits an IP multicast frame with a
      particular source BD to an IPMG, it encapsulates the frame using the
      label specified in that IPMG's BD-S IMET route.  (This is just
      the procedure of <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>.)
        </t>
        <t>
      The (C-*,C-*) S-PMSI A-D route originated by a

      When an OISM PE-S transmits an IP multicast frame to an IPMG, it
      will use the label specified in that IPMG's (C-*,C-*)
      S-PMSI A-D route.
        </t>
        <t>
      When a PE originates both an IMET route and a (C-*,C-*)
      S-PMSI A-D route, the values of the MPLS Label field in the
      respective PTAs must be distinct.  Further, each <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> map uniquely (in
      the context of the originating PE) to the route's BD.
        </t>
    <t>
      As a result, an IPMG receiving an MPLS-encapsulated IP multicast frame
      can always tell by the label whether the frame's ingress PE is an OISM
      PE or a non-OISM PE.  When an IPMG receives a VXLAN-encapsulated
      IP multicast frame, it may need to determine the identity of the
      ingress PE from the outer IP encapsulation; it can then determine
      whether the ingress PE is an OISM PE or a non-OISM PE by looking at
      the IMET route from that PE.

        <t>
      Suppose an IPMG receives an IP multicast frame from another
      EVPN PE in the Tenant Domain and the IPMG is not the
      IPMG-DF for the frame's source BD.  Then, the IPMG performs only
      the ordinary OISM functions; it does not perform the IPMG-specific
      functions for that frame.  In the remainder of this section, when we
      discuss the procedures applied by an IPMG when it receives an IP
      multicast frame, we are presuming that the source BD of the frame is a
      BD for which the IPMG is the IPMG-DF.
        </t>
        <t>
      We have two basic cases to consider: (1) a frame's ingress PE is a
      non-OISM node and (2) a frame's ingress PE is an OISM node.

        <section anchor="pe-s-non-oism" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Ingress PE is Non-OISM</name>
          <t>
        In this case, a non-OISM PE, say PE-S, has received an (S,G)
        multicast frame over an AC that is attached to a particular BD,
        say BD-S.  By virtue of normal EVPN procedures, PE-S has sent
        a copy of the frame to every PE-R (both OISM and non-OISM)
        in the Tenant Domain that is attached to BD-S.  If the
        non-OISM node supports <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>, only PEs
        that have expressed interest in (S,G) receive the frame.  The IPMG
        will have expressed interest via a (C-*,C-*) SMET route
        and thus receives the frame.
          </t>
          <t>
        Any OISM PE (including an IPMG) receiving the frame will apply
        normal OISM procedures.  As a result, it will deliver the frame to
        any of its local ACs (in BD-S or in any other BD) that have
        interest in (S,G).
          </t>
          <t>
        An OISM PE that is also the IPMG-DF for a particular BD, say

            When the IPMG-DF for BD-S receives an (S,G) frame from

            every OISM PE that is NOT attached to BD-S but has interest
            in (S,G).  The copy sent to a given OISM PE-R must carry
            the label that PE-R has assigned to the SBD in an
            S-PMSI A-D route.  The IPMG <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> do any IP
            processing of the frame's IP payload.  TTL decrement and other
            IP processing will be done by PE-R, per the normal OISM
            procedures. There is no need for the IPMG to include an ESI
            label in the frame's tunnel encapsulation, because it is already
            known that the frame's source BD has no presence on
            PE-R. There is also no need for the IPMG to modify the
            frame's MAC SA.

            In addition, when the IPMG-DF for BD-S receives an
            (S,G) frame from a non-OISM node, it may need to forward
            copies of the frame to other non-OISM nodes.  Before it
            does so, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> decapsulate the (S,G) packet and do the IP
            processing (e.g., TTL decrement).  Suppose PE-R is a
            non-OISM node that has an AC to BD-R, where BD-R
            is not the same as BD-S, and that AC has interest in (S,G).
            The IPMG must then encapsulate the (S,G) packet (after the IP
            processing has been done) in an Ethernet header.  The MAC SA
            field will have the MAC address of the IPMG's IRB interface for
            BD-R.  The IPMG then sends the frame to PE-R.  The
            tunnel encapsulation will carry the label that PE-R
            advertised in its IMET route for BD-R.  There is no need to
            include an ESI label, as the source and destination BDs are
            known to be different.

              <t>
            Note that if a non-OISM PE-R has several BDs (other
            than BD-S) with local ACs that have interest in (S,G), the
            IPMG will send it one copy for each such BD.  This is necessary
            because the non-OISM PE cannot move packets from one BD to
            another.

        There may be deployment scenarios in which every OISM PE is

        The PE-Rs follow their normal procedures.  An OISM PE that

        deliver the frame to its local ACs as necessary.  A non-OISM

        Suppose that a non-OISM PE-R has interest in (S,G) on a

        that are not in BD-S.  If PE-R is not even attached to
        BD-S, the OISM PE-S will not send it a copy of the frame
        at all, because PE-R is not attached to the SBD.  In these
        cases, the IPMG needs to relay the (S,G) multicast traffic from OISM
        PE-S to non-OISM PE-R.

      <t>
    In this section, we discuss scenarios where a multicast source outside a
    given EVPN Tenant Domain sends traffic to receivers inside the domain
    (as well as, possibly, to receivers outside the domain).  This requires
    the OISM procedures to interwork with various Layer 3 multicast routing
    procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
     In this section, we assume that the Tenant Domain is not being used as an
    intermediate transit network for multicast traffic; that is, we do not
    consider the case where the Tenant Domain contains multicast routers
    that will receive traffic from sources outside the domain and forward
    the traffic to receivers outside the domain.  The transit scenario is
    considered in <xref target="pim" format="default"/>.

      <t>
    We can divide the non-transit scenarios into two classes:

        Sometimes it is necessary to interwork an EVPN Tenant Domain with an
        external Layer 3 multicast domain (the external domain), e.g.,
		a PIM or MVPN domain.  This is
        needed to allow EVPN tenant systems to receive multicast traffic
        from sources (external sources) outside the EVPN Tenant Domain.
        It is also needed to allow receivers (external receivers) outside
        the EVPN Tenant Domain to receive traffic from sources inside the
        Tenant Domain.
          </t>
          <t>
        In order to allow interworking between an EVPN Tenant Domain and an
        external domain, one or more OISM PEs must be L3 Gateways.  An L3
        Gateway participates both in the OISM procedures and in the L3
        multicast routing procedures of the external domain, as shown in
	the following figure.

          <t>
        An L3 Gateway that has interest in receiving (S,G) traffic must be
        able to determine the best route to S.  If an L3 Gateway has
        interest in (*,G), it must be able to determine the best route to
        G's RP.  In these interworking scenarios, the L3 Gateway must be
        running a Layer 3 unicast routing protocol.  Via this protocol, it
        imports unicast routes (either IP routes or VPN-IP routes) from
        routers other than EVPN PEs.  And since there may be multicast
        sources inside the EVPN Tenant Domain, the EVPN PEs also need to
        export, either as IP routes or as VPN-IP routes (depending upon
        the external domain), unicast routes to those sources.
          </t>
          <t>
        When selecting the best route to a multicast source or RP, an L3
        Gateway might have a choice between an EVPN route and an
        IP/VPN-IP route.  When such a choice exists, the L3 Gateway
        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> always prefer the EVPN route.  This will ensure that when
        traffic originates in the Tenant Domain and has a receiver in the
        Tenant Domain, the path to that receiver will remain within the EVPN
        Tenant Domain, even if the source is also reachable via a routed
        path.  This also provides protection against sub-optimal
        routing that might occur if two EVPN PEs export IP/VPN-IP
        routes and each imports the other's IP/VPN-IP routes.
          </t>
          <t>
        <xref target="rpf" format="default"/> discusses the way Layer 3 multicast states are
        constructed by OISM PEs.  These Layer 3 multicast states have IRB
        interfaces as their IIF and OIF list entries and are the basis for
        interworking OISM with other Layer 3 multicast procedures such as
        MVPN or PIM.  From the perspective of the Layer 3 multicast
        procedures running in a given L3 Gateway, an EVPN Tenant Domain is a
        set of IRB interfaces.
          </t>
          <t>
        When interworking an EVPN Tenant Domain with an external domain, the
        L3 Gateway's Layer 3 multicast states will not only have IRB
        interfaces as IIF and OIF list entries but also other interfaces
        that lead outside the Tenant Domain.  For example, when interworking
        with MVPN, the multicast states may have MVPN tunnels as well as IRB
        interfaces as IIF or OIF list members.  When interworking with PIM,
        the multicast states may have PIM-enabled non-IRB interfaces as
        IIF or OIF list members.
          </t>
          <t>
        As long as a Tenant Domain is not being used as an intermediate
        transit network for IP multicast traffic, it is not necessary to
        enable PIM on its IRB interfaces.
          </t>
          <t>
        In general, an L3 Gateway has the following responsibilities:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>

            multicast sources in the EVPN Tenant Domain that are locally
            attached to the L3 Gateway.
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
            It imports, from the external domain, unicast routes to
            multicast sources that are in the external domain.
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
            It executes the procedures necessary to draw externally sourced
            multicast traffic that is of interest to locally attached
            receivers in the EVPN Tenant Domain.  When such traffic is
            received, the traffic is sent down the IRB interfaces of the BDs
            on which the locally attached receivers reside.
              </t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
        One of the L3 Gateways in a given Tenant Domain becomes the DR for
        the SBD (see <xref target="dr_selection" format="default"/>).  This L3 Gateway has
        the following additional responsibilities:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>
            It exports, to the external domain, unicast routes to multicast
            sources in the EVPN Tenant Domain that are not locally
            attached to any L3 Gateway.
              </t>
            </li>

            sources that are in the external domain.

            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
            It executes the procedures necessary to draw externally sourced
            multicast traffic that is of interest to receivers in the EVPN
            Tenant Domain that are not locally attached to an L3 Gateway.
            When such traffic is received, the traffic is sent down the SBD
            IRB interface.  OISM procedures already described in this
            document will then ensure that the IP multicast traffic gets
            distributed throughout the Tenant Domain to any EVPN PEs that
            have interest in it. Thus, to an OISM PE that is not an L3
            Gateway, the externally sourced traffic will appear to have been
            sourced on the SBD.
              </t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
        In order for this to work, some special care is needed when an L3
        Gateway creates or modifies a Layer 3 (*,G) multicast state.
        Suppose group G has both external sources (sources outside the EVPN
        Tenant Domain) and internal sources (sources inside the EVPN Tenant
        Domain). <xref target="rpf" format="default"/> states that when there are internal
        sources, the SBD IRB interface must not be added to the OIF list of
        the (*,G) state.  Traffic from internal sources will already have
        been delivered to all the EVPN PEs that have interest in it.
        However, if the OIF list of the (*,G) state does not contain its SBD
        IRB interface, then traffic from external sources will not get
        delivered to other EVPN PEs.
          </t>
          <t>
        One way of handling this is the following.  When an L3 Gateway
        receives (S,G) traffic that is from an interface other than IRB, and the
        traffic corresponds to a Layer 3 (*,G) state, the L3 Gateway can
        create (S,G) state.  The IIF will be set to the external interface
        over which the traffic is expected.  The OIF list will contain the
        SBD IRB interface, as well as the IRB interfaces of any other BDs
        attached to the PEG DR that have locally attached receivers with
        interest in the (S,G) traffic.  The (S,G) state will ensure that the
        external traffic is sent down the SBD IRB interface. The following
        text will assume this procedure; however, other implementation
        techniques may also be possible.
          </t>
          <t>
        If a particular BD is attached to several L3
        Gateways, one of the L3 Gateways becomes the DR for that BD (see
        <xref target="dr_selection" format="default"/>).  If the interworking scenario
        requires FHR functionality, it is generally the DR for a particular
        BD that is responsible for performing that functionality on behalf
        of the source hosts on that BD (e.g., if the interworking scenario
        requires that PIM Register messages be sent by an FHR, the DR for a
        given BD would send the PIM Register messages for sources on that
        BD).  Although, note that the DR for the SBD does not perform FHR
        functionality on behalf of external sources.
          </t>
          <t>
        An optional alternative is to have each L3 Gateway perform FHR
        functionality for locally attached sources.  Then, the DR would only
        have to perform FHR functionality on behalf of sources that are
        locally attached to itself AND sources that are not attached to any
        L3 Gateway.
          </t>
          <t>
        Note that if it is possible that more than one BD contains a tenant
        multicast router, then a PE receiving a SMET route for that BD <bcp14>MUST
        NOT</bcp14> reconstruct IGMP/MLD Join Reports from the SMET route and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
        transmit any such IGMP/MLD Join Reports on its local ACs attaching to
        that BD. Otherwise, multicast traffic may be duplicated.

          <name>Interworking with MVPN</name>
          <t>
      In this section, we specify the procedures necessary to allow EVPN PEs
      running OISM procedures to interwork with L3VPN PEs that run BGP-based
      MVPN <xref target="RFC6514" format="default"/> procedures.  More specifically, the
      procedures herein allow a given EVPN Tenant Domain to become part of
      an L3VPN/MVPN and support multicast flows where either of the following occurs:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>
          The source of a given multicast flow is attached to an Ethernet
          segment whose BD is part of an EVPN Tenant Domain, and one or
          more receivers of the flow are attached to the network via
          L3VPN/MVPN.  (Other receivers may be attached to the network via
          EVPN.)
              </t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>
          The source of a given multicast flow is attached to the network
          via L3VPN/MVPN, and one or more receivers of the flow are attached
          to an Ethernet segment that is part of an EVPN Tenant
          Domain. (Other receivers may be attached via L3VPN/MVPN.)
              </t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
      In this interworking model, existing L3VPN/MVPN PEs are unaware that
      certain sources or receivers are part of an EVPN Tenant Domain.  The
      existing L3VPN/MVPN nodes run only their standard procedures and are
      entirely unaware of EVPN.  Interworking is achieved by having some or
      all of the EVPN PEs function as L3 Gateways running L3VPN/MVPN
      procedures, as detailed in the following subsections.
          </t>
          <t>
      In this section, we assume that there are no tenant multicast routers
      on any of the EVPN-attached Ethernet segments.  (Of course, there may
      be multicast routers in the L3VPN.)  Consideration of the case where
      there are tenant multicast routers is addressed in <xref target="pim" format="default"/>.
          </t>
    <t>
      To support MVPN/EVPN interworking, we introduce the notion of an
      MVPN/EVPN Gateway (MEG).
          </t>
          <t>
      A MEG is an L3 Gateway (see <xref target="gen_prin" format="default"/>); hence, it is both
      an OISM PE and an L3VPN/MVPN PE.  For a given EVPN Tenant Domain, it
      will have an IP-VRF. If the Tenant Domain is part of an
      L3VPN/MVPN, the IP-VRF also serves as an L3VPN VRF <xref target="RFC4364" format="default"/>.  The IRB interfaces of the IP-VRF are
      considered to be VRF interfaces of the L3VPN VRF.  The L3VPN VRF may
      also have other local VRF interfaces that are not EVPN IRB interfaces.
          </t>
          <t>
      The VRF on the MEG will import VPN-IP routes <xref target="RFC4364" format="default"/> from other L3VPN PE routers.  It
      will also export VPN-IP routes to other L3VPN PE routers.  In
      order to do so, it must be appropriately configured with the RTs
      used in the L3VPN to control the distribution of the
      VPN-IP routes.  In general, these RTs will be different
      than the RTs used for controlling the distribution of EVPN
      routes, as there is no need to distribute EVPN routes to L3VPN-only
      PEs and no reason to distribute L3VPN/MVPN routes to EVPN-only PEs.
          </t>
          <t>
      Note that the RDs in the imported VPN-IP routes will not
      necessarily conform to the EVPN rules (as specified in <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>) for creating RDs.  Therefore, a MEG <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> expect
      the RDs of the VPN-IP routes to be of any particular format other
      than what is required by the L3VPN/MVPN specifications.
          </t>
          <t>
      The VPN-IP routes that a MEG exports to L3VPN are subnet routes
      and/or host routes for the multicast sources that are part of the EVPN
      Tenant Domain.  The exact set of routes that need to be exported is
      discussed in <xref target="e2m" format="default"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
      Each IMET route originated by a MEG <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> carry a Multicast Flags
      Extended Community with the MEG flag set, indicating that the
      originator of the IMET route is a MEG. However, PE1 will consider PE2
      to be a MEG if PE1 imports at least one IMET route from PE2 that
      carries the Multicast Flags EC with the MEG flag set.
          </t>
          <t>
      All the MEGs of a given Tenant Domain attach to the SBD of that
      domain, and one of them is selected to be the SBD's Designated Router 
      (the MEG SBD-DR) for the domain.  The selection procedure is
      discussed in <xref target="dr_selection" format="default"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
      In this model of operation, MVPN procedures and EVPN procedures are
      largely independent.  In particular, there is no assumption that MVPN
      and EVPN use the same kind of tunnels.  Thus, no special procedures are
      needed to handle the common scenarios where, e.g., EVPN uses VXLAN
      tunnels but MVPN uses MPLS P2MP tunnels, or where EVPN uses IR
      but MVPN uses MPLS P2MP tunnels.
          </t>
          <t>
      Similarly, no special procedures are needed to prevent duplicate data
      delivery on Ethernet segments that are multihomed.
          </t>
          <t>
      The MEG does have some special procedures (described below) for
      interworking between EVPN and MVPN; these have to do with selection of
      the Upstream PE for a given multicast source, with the exporting of
      VPN-IP routes and with the generation of MVPN C-multicast
      routes triggered by the installation of SMET routes.

            <name>MVPN Sources with EVPN Receivers</name>
            <section anchor="mvpn_source" numbered="true" toc="default">
              <name>Identifying MVPN Sources</name>
              <t>
          Consider a multicast source S.  It is possible that a MEG will
          import both an EVPN unicast route to S and a VPN-IP route (or
          an ordinary IP route), where the prefix length of each route is
          the same.  In order to draw (S,G) multicast traffic for any group
          G, the MEG <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the EVPN route rather than the VPN-IP
          or IP route to determine the Upstream PE (see <xref target="RFC6513" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="5"/>).
              </t>
              <t>
          Doing so ensures that when an EVPN tenant system desires to
          receive a multicast flow from another EVPN tenant system, the
          traffic from the source to that receiver stays within the EVPN
          domain.  This prevents problems that might arise if there is a
          unicast route via L3VPN to S but no multicast routers along the
          routed path.  This also prevents problem that might arise as a
          result of the fact that the MEGs will import each others'
          VPN-IP routes.
              </t>
              <t>
          In <xref target="mvpn_join" format="default"/>, we describe the procedures to
          be used when the selected route to S is a VPN-IP route.

          Consider a tenant system, say R, on a particular BD, say BD-R.  Suppose R
          wants to receive (S,G) multicast traffic, where source S is not

              Suppose R is on a singly homed Ethernet segment of BD-R
              and that segment is attached to PE1, where PE1 is a MEG.  PE1
              learns via IGMP/MLD listening that R is interested in (S,G).
              PE1 determines from its VRF that there is no route to S within
              the Tenant Domain (i.e., no EVPN RT-2 route matching on S's IP
              address) but that there is a route to S via L3VPN (i.e., the
              VRF contains a subnet or host route to S that was received as
              a VPN-IP route).  Thus, PE1 originates (if it hasn't
              already) an MVPN C-multicast Source Tree Join (S,G) route.
              The route is constructed according to normal MVPN procedures.

              of its local ACs to BD-R is interested in (S,G) traffic.
              The DF is responsible for originating an SBD-SMET route for
              (S,G), following normal OISM procedures.  If the DF is a MEG,
              it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> originate the corresponding MVPN C-multicast

              route. This will cause the traffic to flow to both the DF and
              the non-DF, but only the DF will forward the traffic out an
              AC.  This allows for quicker recovery if the DF's local AC to

          If an EVPN-attached receiver is interested in (*,G) traffic, and

          are attached only to L3VPN nodes, the MEGs will have to know the
          group-to-RP mappings.  That will enable them to originate MVPN
          C-multicast Shared Tree Join (*,G) routes and to send them
          toward the RP. (Since we are assuming in this section that there
          are no tenant multicast routers attached to the EVPN Tenant
          Domain, the RP must be attached via L3VPN.  Alternatively, the MEG

              <t>
          In the Layer 3 (*,G) multicast state, the IIF is the appropriate
          MVPN tunnel. A MEG will add its IRB
          interfaces to the (*,G) OIF list for any BDs containing locally attached receivers.  If
          there are receivers attached to other EVPN PEs, then whenever
          (S,G) traffic from an external source matches a (*,G) state, the
          MEG will create (S,G) state, with the MVPN tunnel as the IIF, the
          OIF list copied from the (*,G) state, and the SBD IRB interface
          added to the OIF list.  (Please see the discussion in <xref target="gen_prin" format="default"/> regarding the inclusion of the SBD IRB
          interface in a (*,G) state; the SBD IRB interface is only used in the
          OIF list for traffic from external sources.)
              </t>
        <t>
          Normal MVPN procedures will then result in the MEG getting the
          (*,G) traffic from all the multicast sources for G that are
          attached via L3VPN.  This traffic arrives on MVPN tunnels.  When
          the MEG removes the traffic from these tunnels, it does the IP
          processing.  If there are any receivers on a given BD, say BD-R,
          that are attached via local EVPN ACs, the MEG sends the traffic
          down its BD-R IRB interface.  If there are any other EVPN PEs
          that are interested in the (*,G) traffic, the MEG sends the
          traffic down the SBD IRB interface.  Normal OISM procedures then
          distribute the traffic as needed to other EVPN PEs.

              <t>
          In this case, an L3VPN PE through which R can be reached has to
          send an MVPN C-multicast Join (S,G) route to one of the MEGs
          that is attached to the EVPN Tenant Domain.  For this to happen,
          the L3VPN PE must have imported a VPN-IP route for S (either a

          Join, that MEG will originate an EVPN SMET route for (S,G).  As a

          ensure that the traffic is delivered to the L3VPN nodes that have
          requested it.  The Layer 3 multicast state for (S,G) will have the

          to the RP, etc.
              </t>
              <t>
          If the MEG SBD-DR is to be the FHR for the Tenant Domain, it
          must see all the multicast traffic that is sourced from within the
          domain and destined to an ASM group address.  The MEG can ensure
          this by originating an SBD-SMET route for (*,*).

          In some deployment scenarios, it may be preferred that the MEG

          FHR functionality.  This behavior is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.  If this option is

              <t>
          This creates an issue for MVPN/EVPN interworking, because there is

          (S,G2) traffic.

            <name>Obtaining Optimal Routing of Traffic between MVPN and EVPN</name>
            <t>
        The routing of IP multicast traffic between MVPN nodes and EVPN
        nodes will be optimal as long as there is a MEG along the optimal
        route. There are various deployment strategies that can be used to
        obtain optimal routing between MVPN and EVPN.
            </t>
            <t>
        In one such scenario, a Tenant Domain will have a small number of
        strategically placed MEGs.  For example, a data center may have a
        small number of MEGs that connect it to a wide-area network.  Then,
        the optimal route into or out of the data center would be through
        the MEGs.
            </t>
            <t>
        In this scenario, the MEGs do not need to originate VPN-IP host
        routes for the multicast sources; they only need to originate
        VPN-IP subnet routes.  The internal structure of the EVPN is
        completely hidden from the MVPN node.  EVPN actions, such as MAC
        Mobility and Mass Withdrawal <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>, have zero
        impact on the MVPN control plane.
            </t>
            <t>
        While this deployment scenario provides the most optimal routing and
        has the least impact on the installed based of MVPN nodes, it does
        complicate network planning considerations.
            </t>
            <t>
        Another way of providing routing that is close to optimal is to turn
        each EVPN PE into a MEG.  Then, routing of MVPN-to-EVPN traffic is
        optimal.  However, routing of EVPN-to-MVPN traffic is not guaranteed
        to be optimal when a source host is on a multihomed Ethernet
        segment (as discussed in <xref target="e2m" format="default"/>.)
            </t>
            <t>
        The obvious disadvantage of this method is that it requires every
        EVPN PE to be a MEG.
            </t>
            <t>
        The procedures specified in this document allow an operator to add
        MEG functionality to any subset of its EVPN OISM PEs.  This allows
        an operator to make whatever trade-offs deemed appropriate between
        optimal routing and MEG deployment.

      There are also cases where an external source or receiver are attached
      via IP and the Layer 3 multicast routing is done via PIM.  In this
      case, the interworking between the PIM domain and the EVPN Tenant
      Domain is done at L3 Gateways that perform PIM/EVPN Gateway (PEG)
      functionality.  A PEG is very similar to a MEG, except that its Layer

      If external sources or receivers for a given group are attached to a
      PEG via a Layer 3 interface, that interface should be treated as a VRF
      interface attached to the Tenant Domain's L3VPN VRF.  The Layer 3
      multicast routing instance for that Tenant Domain will either run PIM
      on the VRF interface or listen for IGMP/MLD messages on that
      interface.  If the external receiver is attached elsewhere on an IP
      network, the PE has to enable PIM on its interfaces to the backbone
      network.  In both cases, the PE needs to perform PEG functionality,
      and its IMET routes must carry the Multicast Flags EC with the PEG

        If a PEG receives a PIM Join (S,G) from outside the EVPN Tenant
        Domain, it may find it necessary to create (S,G) state.  The PE
        needs to determine whether S is within the Tenant Domain.  If S is
        not within the EVPN Tenant Domain, the PE carries out normal Layer 3
        multicast routing procedures.  If S is within the EVPN Tenant
        Domain, the IIF of the (S,G) state is set as follows:

        When the PE creates such an (S,G) state, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> originate (if it

        it to pull the (S,G) traffic via Layer 2.  When the traffic arrives

        Layer 3 multicast routing determines the packet's disposition.  The

        the (S,G) traffic originating on a given BD by originating a SMET
        (*,*) route for that BD.  If a PEG DR is the DR for all the BDs, it

        PE2.  If PE1 receives an external PIM Join (S,G) route, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        originate a SMET route for (S,G).  Normal OISM procedures will
        cause PE2 to send the (S,G) traffic to PE1 on an EVPN IP multicast

        (S,G) traffic up its BD1 IRB interface.  Normal PIM procedures will
        then cause PE1 to forward the traffic along a PIM tree.  In this

        By means of normal OISM procedures, a PEG learns whether there are

        have to originate PIM Joins on behalf of receivers that are not
        attached to a PEG. However, if this is done, it is necessary for the

        ensures that any receivers locally attached to the PEG DR will
        receive the traffic.  If there are receivers attached to other EVPN
        PEs, then whenever (S,G) traffic from an external source matches a
        (*,G) state, the PEG will create (S,G) state.  The IIF will be set
        to whatever external interface the traffic is expected to arrive on
        (copied from the (*,G) state), the OIF list is copied from the (*,G)
        state, and the SBD IRB interface is added to the OIF list.

        <name>Interworking with PIM via an External PIM Router</name>
  <t>
    <xref target="evpn-pe-l3-iwork" format="default"/> describes how to use an OISM PE router
    as the gateway to a non-EVPN multicast domain when the EVPN Tenant
    Domain is not being used as an intermediate transit network for
    multicast.  An alternative approach is to have one or more external PIM
    routers (perhaps operated by a tenant) on one of the BDs of the Tenant
    Domain.  We will refer to this BD as the "gateway BD".
        </t>
        <t>
    In this model:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>
        The EVPN Tenant Domain is treated as a stub network attached to the
        external PIM routers.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
        The external PIM routers follow normal PIM procedures and provide
        the FHR and LHR functionality for the entire Tenant Domain.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
        The OISM PEs do not run PIM.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
        There <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be more than one gateway BD.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
        If an OISM PE not attached to the gateway BD has interest in a given
        multicast flow, it conveys that interest, following normal OISM
        procedures, by originating an SBD-SMET route for that flow.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
        If a PE attached to the gateway BD receives an SBD-SMET, it may need
        to generate and transmit a corresponding IGMP/MLD Join on one or
        more of its ACs.  (Procedures for generating an IGMP/MLD Join as a
        result of receiving a SMET route are given in <xref target="RFC9251" format="default"/>.)  The PE <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> know which BD is the gateway BD
        and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> transmit an IGMP/MLD Join to any other BDs.
        Furthermore, even if a particular AC is part of that BD, the PE
        <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> transmit an IGMP/MLD Join on that AC unless there is an
        external PIM router attached via that AC.
            </t>
            <t>
        As a result, IGMP/MLD messages will be received by the external PIM routers
        on the gateway BD, and those external PIM routers will send PIM Join
        messages externally as required. Traffic for the given multicast flow
        will then be received by one of the external PIM routers, and that
        traffic will be forwarded by that router to the gateway BD.
            </t>
            <t>
        The normal OISM procedures will then cause the given multicast flow
        to be tunneled to any PEs of the EVPN Tenant Domain that have
        interest in the flow.  PEs attached to the gateway BD will see the
        flow as originating from the gateway BD, and other PEs will see the flow
        as originating from the SBD.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
        An OISM PE attached to a gateway BD <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set its Layer 2 multicast
        state to indicate that each AC to the gateway BD has interest in all
        multicast flows.  It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also originate a SMET route for (*,*).
        The procedures for originating SMET routes are discussed in <xref target="interest" format="default"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
        This will cause the OISM PEs attached to the gateway BD to receive
        all the IP multicast traffic that is sourced within the EVPN Tenant
        Domain and to transmit that traffic to the gateway BD, where the
        external PIM routers will receive it.  This enables the external PIM
        routers to perform FHR functions on behalf of the entire Tenant
        Domain.  (Of course, if the gateway BD has a multihomed
        segment, only the PE that is the DF for that segment will transmit
        the multicast traffic to the segment.)

      <name>Using an EVPN Tenant Domain as an Intermediate (Transit) Network for Multicast Traffic</name>
  <t>
    In this section, we consider the scenario where one or more BDs of an
    EVPN Tenant Domain are being used to carry IP multicast traffic for
    which the source and at least one receiver are not part the Tenant
    Domain.  That is, one or more BDs of the Tenant Domain are intermediate
    links of a larger multicast tree created by PIM.
      </t>
      <t>
    We define a "tenant multicast router" as a multicast router, running
    PIM, that:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t>
        is attached to one or more BDs of the Tenant Domain but
          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
        is not an EVPN PE router.
          </t>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <t>
    In order for an EVPN Tenant Domain to be used as a transit network for IP
    multicast, one or more of its BDs must have tenant multicast routers,
    and an OISM PE attached to such a BD <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provisioned to enable
    PIM on its IRB interface to that BD. (This is true even if none of the
    tenant routers is on a segment attached to the PE.)  Further, all the
    OISM PEs (even ones not attached to a BD with tenant multicast routers)
    <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provisioned to enable PIM on their SBD IRB interfaces.
      </t>
      <t>
    If PIM is enabled on a particular BD, the DR selection procedure of
    <xref target="dr_selection" format="default"/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be replaced by the normal PIM DR
    Election procedure of <xref target="RFC7761" format="default"/>.  Note that this may
    result in one of the tenant routers being selected as the DR rather
    than one of the OISM PE routers.  In this case, First Hop Router and
    Last Hop Router functionality will not be performed by any of the EVPN
    PEs. 
      </t>
      <t>
    A PIM control message on a particular BD is considered to be a
    link-local multicast message and, as such, is sent transparently
    from PE to PE via the BUM tunnel for that BD.  This is true whether the
    control message was received from an AC or from
    the local Layer 3 routing instance via an IRB interface.
      </t>
  <t>
    A PIM Join/Prune message contains three fields that are relevant to the
    present discussion:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>
        Upstream Neighbor
          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
        Group Address (G)
          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
        Source Address (S), omitted in the case of (*,G) Join/Prune messages
          </t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
    We will generally speak of a PIM Join as a Join (S,G) or a Join (*,G)
    message and will use the term "Join (X,G)" to mean either "Join (S,G)" or
    "Join (*,G)". In the context of a Join (X,G), we will use the term "X" to
    mean "S" in the case of (S,G) or "G's RP" in the case of (*,G).
      </t>
      <t>
    Suppose BD1 contains two tenant multicast routers, say C1 and C2.  Suppose
    C1 is on a segment attached to PE1 and C2 is on a segment attached to
    PE2.  When C1 sends a PIM Join (X,G) to BD1, the Upstream Neighbor field
    might be set to PE1, PE2, or C2.  C1 chooses the Upstream
    Neighbor based on its unicast routing.  Typically, it will choose
    the PIM router on BD1 that is closest (according to
    the unicast routing) to X as the
    Upstream Neighbor.  Note that this will not necessarily be PE1.
    PE1 may not even be visible to the unicast routing algorithm used by the
    tenant routers.  Even if it is, it is unlikely to be the PIM router that
    is closest to X.  So we need to consider the following two cases:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t>
        C1 sends a PIM Join (X,G) to BD1, with PE1 as the Upstream Neighbor.
          </t>
          <t>
        PE1's PIM routing instance will receive the Join arrive on the BD1 IRB
        interface.  If X is not within the Tenant Domain, PE1 handles the
        Join according to normal PIM procedures.  This will generally result
        in PE1 selecting an Upstream Neighbor and sending it a Join (X,G).
          </t>
          <t>
        If X is within the Tenant Domain but is attached to some other PE,
        PE1 sends (if it hasn't already) an SBD-SMET route for (X,G).
        The IIF of the Layer 3 (X,G) state will be the SBD IRB interface,
        and the OIF list will include the IRB interface to BD1.
          </t>
          <t>
        The SBD-SMET route will pull the (X,G) traffic to PE1, and the
        (X,G) state will result in the (X,G) traffic being forwarded to C1.
          </t>
          <t>
        If X is within the Tenant Domain but is attached to PE1 itself, no
        SBD-SMET route is sent.  The IIF of the Layer 3 (X,G) state
        will be the IRB interface to X's BD, and the OIF list will include
        the IRB interface to BD1.
          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
        C1 sends a PIM Join (X,G) to BD1, with either PE2 or C2 as the
        Upstream Neighbor.
          </t>
          <t>
        PE1's PIM routing instance will receive the Join arrive on the BD1 IRB
        interface.  If neither X nor Upstream Neighbor is within the Tenant
        Domain, PE1 handles the Join according to normal PIM procedures.
        This will NOT result in PE1 sending a Join (X,G).
          </t>
          <t>
        If either X or Upstream Neighbor is within the Tenant Domain, PE1
        sends (if it hasn't already) an SBD-SMET route for (X,G).  The
        IIF of the Layer 3 (X,G) state will be the SBD IRB interface, and
        the OIF list will include the IRB interface to BD1.
          </t>
          <t>
        The SBD-SMET route will pull the (X,G) traffic to PE1, and the
        (X,G) state will result in the (X,G) traffic being forwarded to C1.

      <t>
    This document uses protocols and procedures defined in the normative
    references and inherits the security considerations of those
    references.
      </t>
      <t>
    This document adds flags or Extended Communities (ECs) to a number of
    BGP routes in order to signal that particular nodes support the OISM,
    IPMG, MEG, and/or PEG functionalities that are defined in this document.
    Incorrect addition, removal, or modification of those flags and/or ECs
    will cause the procedures defined herein to malfunction, in which case
    loss or diversion of data traffic is possible. Implementations should
	provide tools to easily debug configuration mistakes that cause the
	signaling of incorrect information.
      </t>
      <t>
The interworking with non-OISM networks described in Sections <xref target="no-OISM" format="counter"/> and <xref target="external" format="counter"/>
requires gateway functions in multiple redundant PEs, among which one of
them is elected as Designated Forwarder for a given BD (or SBD). The 
election of the MEG or PEG DR, as well as the IPMG 
Designated Forwarder, makes use of the Designated Forwarder election
procedures <xref target="RFC8584"/>. An attacker with access to one of these Gateways may 
influence such election and therefore modify the forwarding of multicast traffic
between the OISM network and the external domain. The operator 
should be especially careful with the protection of these gateways by making
sure the management interfaces to access the gateways are only allowed to
authorized operators. 
      </t>
      <t>
The document also introduces the concept of per-Tenant-Domain dissemination 
for the SMET routes, as opposed to per-BD distribution in <xref target="RFC9251"/>. That is,
a SMET route triggered by the reception of an IGMP/MLD Join in BD-1 on PE1
needs to be distributed and imported by all PEs of the Tenant Domain, even 
to those PEs that are not attached to BD-1. This means that an attacker with 
access to only one BD in a PE of the Tenant Domain might force the advertisement of 
SMET routes and impact the resources of all the PEs of the Tenant Domain, as 
opposed to only the PEs of that particular BD (as in <xref target="RFC9251"/>). The 
implementation should provide ways to filter/control the client IGMP/MLD 
reports that are received by the attached hosts.

      <name>Integrated Routing and Bridging</name>
      <t>
        This appendix provides a short tutorial on the interaction of
        routing and bridging.  First, it shows a model, where
        bridging and routing are performed in separate devices.  Then, it shows
        the model specified in <xref target="RFC9135" format="default"/>, where a single device
        contains both routing and bridging functions.  The latter model is
        presupposed in the body of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="conventional_router" format="default"/> shows the model where a router
        only does routing and has no L2 bridging capabilities.  There
        are two LANs: LAN1 and LAN2.  LAN1 is realized by switch1, and LAN2 is realized by
        switch2.  The router has an interface, lan1, that attaches to LAN1
        (via switch1) and an interface, lan2, that attaches to LAN2 (via
        switch2).  Each interface is configured, as an IP interface, with an
        IP address and a subnet mask.

      <t>
        IP traffic (unicast or multicast) that remains within a single
        subnet never reaches the router.  For instance, if H1 emits an
        Ethernet frame with H2's MAC address in the Ethernet Destination
        Address field, the frame will go from H1 to Switch1 to H2 without
        ever reaching the router.  Since the frame is never seen by a
        router, the IP datagram within the frame remains entirely unchanged,
        e.g., its TTL is not decremented.  The Ethernet Source and
        Destination MAC addresses are not changed either.
      </t>
      <t>
        If H1 wants to send a unicast IP datagram to H3, which is on a
        different subnet, H1 has to be configured with the IP address of a
        default router.  Let's assume that H1 is configured with an IP
        address of Router1 as its default router address.  H1 compares H3's
        IP address with its own IP address and IP subnet mask and
        determines that H3 is on a different subnet.  So the packet has to
        be routed.  H1 uses ARP to map Router1's IP address to a MAC address
        on LAN1.  H1 then encapsulates the datagram in an Ethernet frame,
        using Router1's MAC address as the destination MAC address, and
        sends the frame to Router1.
      </t>
      <t>
        Router1 then receives the frame over its lan1 interface.  Router1
        sees that the frame is addressed to it, so it removes the Ethernet
        encapsulation and processes the IP datagram.  The datagram is not
        addressed to Router1, so it must be forwarded further. Router1 does
        a lookup of the datagram's IP Destination Address field and determines that
        the destination (H3) can be reached via Router1's lan2 interface.
        Router1 now performs the IP processing of the datagram: it
        decrements the IP TTL, adjusts the IP header checksum (if present),
        may fragment the packet as necessary, etc.  Then, the datagram (or
        its fragments) is encapsulated in an Ethernet header, with
        Router1's MAC address on LAN2 as the MAC Source Address and H3's
        MAC address on LAN2 (which Router1 determines via ARP) as the
        Destination MAC Address.  Finally, the packet is sent on the lan2
        interface.
      </t>
      <t>
        If H1 has an IP multicast datagram to send (i.e., an IP datagram
        whose Destination Address field is an IP Multicast Address), it
        encapsulates it in an Ethernet frame whose Destination MAC Address
        is computed from the IP Destination Address.
      </t>
      <t>
        If H2 is a receiver for that multicast address, H2 will receive a
        copy of the frame, unchanged, from H1.  The MAC Source Address in
        the Ethernet encapsulation does not change, the IP TTL field does
        not get decremented, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
        If H3 is a receiver for that multicast address, the datagram must be
        routed to H3.  In order for this to happen, Router1 must be
        configured as a multicast router, and it must accept traffic sent to
        Ethernet multicast addresses.  Router1 will receive H1's multicast
        frame on its lan1 interface, remove the Ethernet encapsulation,
        and determine how to dispatch the IP datagram based on
        Router1's multicast forwarding states.  If Router1 knows that there
        is a receiver for the multicast datagram on LAN2, it makes a copy of
        the datagram, decrements the TTL (and performs any other necessary
        IP processing), and then encapsulates the datagram in the Ethernet frame for
        LAN2.  The MAC Source Address for this frame will be Router1's MAC
        Source Address on LAN2.  The Destination MAC Address is computed
        from the IP Destination Address.  Finally, the frame is sent on
        Router1's LAN2 interface.

      <t>
        In <xref target="IRB" format="default"/>, a single device consists of one or more L3
        Routing Instances.  The routing/forwarding tables of a given
        routing instance is known as an IP-VRF <xref target="RFC9135" format="default"/>.
        In the context of EVPN, it is convenient to think of each routing
        instance as representing the routing of a particular tenant.  Each
        IP-VRF is attached to one or more interfaces.
      </t>
      <t>
        When several EVPN PEs have a routing instance of the same Tenant
        Domain, those PEs advertise IP routes to the attached hosts.  This
        is done as specified in <xref target="RFC9135" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The integrated router/bridge shown in <xref target="IRB" format="default"/> also
        attaches to a number of Broadcast Domains (BDs).  Each BD performs
        the functions that are performed by the bridges in <xref target="conventional_router" format="default"/>.  To the L3 routing instance, each BD
        appears to be a LAN.  The interface attaching a particular BD to a
        particular IP-VRF is known as an "IRB interface".  From the
        perspective of L3 routing, each BD is a subnet.  Thus, each IRB
        interface is configured with a MAC address (which is the router's
        MAC address on the corresponding LAN), as well as an IP address and
        subnet mask.
      </t>
      <t>
        The integrated router/bridge shown in <xref target="IRB" format="default"/> may have
        multiple ACs to each BD.  These ACs are visible only to the bridging
        function, not to the routing instance.  To the L3 routing instance,
        there is just one interface to each BD.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the L3 routing instance represents the IP routing of a particular
        tenant, the BDs attached to that routing instance are BDs belonging
        to that same tenant.
      </t>
      <t>
        Bridging and routing now proceed exactly as in the case of <xref target="conventional_router" format="default"/>, except that BD1 replaces Switch1,
        BD2 replaces Switch2, interface IRB1 replaces interface lan1, and
        interface IRB2 replaces interface lan2.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is important to understand that an IRB interface connects an L3
        routing instance to a BD, NOT to a MAC-VRF (see <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/> for the definition of MAC-VRF).  A
        MAC-VRF may contain several BDs, as long as no MAC address
        appears in more than one BD.  From the perspective of the L3 routing
        instance, each individual BD is an individual IP subnet; whether or not
        each BD has its own MAC-VRF is irrelevant to the L3
        routing instance.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="two_router_irb" format="default"/> illustrates IRB when a pair of BDs
        (subnets) are attached to two different PE routers.  In this
        example, each BD has two segments, and one segment of each BD is
        attached to one PE router.

        If H1 needs to send an IP packet to H4, it determines from its IP
        address and subnet mask that H4 is on the same subnet as H1.
        Although H1 and H4 are not attached to the same PE router, EVPN
        provides Ethernet communication among all hosts that are on the same
        BD. Thus, H1 uses ARP to find H4's MAC address and sends an
        Ethernet frame with H4's MAC address in the Destination MAC Address
        field.  The frame is received at PE1, but since the Destination MAC
        address is not PE1's MAC address, PE1 assumes that the frame is to
        remain on BD1.  Therefore, the packet inside the frame is NOT
        decapsulated and is NOT sent up the IRB interface to PE1's routing
        instance. Rather, standard EVPN intra-subnet procedures (as
        detailed in <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>) are used to deliver the frame
        to PE2, which then sends it to H4.
      </t>
      <t>
        If H1 needs to send an IP packet to H5, it determines from its IP
        address and subnet mask that H5 is NOT on the same subnet as H1.
        Assuming that H1 has been configured with the IP address of PE1 as
        its default router, H1 sends the packet in an Ethernet frame with
        PE1's MAC address in its Destination MAC Address field.  PE1
        receives the frame and sees that the frame is addressed to it. Thus, PE1
        sends the frame up its IRB1 interface to the L3 routing
        instance.  Appropriate IP processing is done, e.g., TTL decrement.
        The L3 routing instance determines that the next hop for H5 is
        PE2, so the packet is encapsulated (e.g., in MPLS) and sent across
        the backbone to PE2's routing instance.  PE2 will see that the
        packet's destination, H5, is on BD2 segment-2 and will send the
        packet down its IRB2 interface.  This causes the IP packet to be
        encapsulated in an Ethernet frame with PE2's MAC address (on BD2) in
        the Source Address field and H5's MAC address in the Destination
        Address field.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that if H1 has an IP packet to send to H3, the forwarding of
        the packet is handled entirely within PE1.  PE1's routing instance
        sees the packet arrive on its IRB1 interface and then transmits the
        packet by sending it down its IRB2 interface.
      </t>
      <t>
        Often, all the hosts in a particular Tenant Domain will be
        provisioned with the same value of the default router IP address.
        This IP address can be provisioned as an anycast address in all the
        EVPN PEs attached to that Tenant Domain.  Thus, although all hosts
        are provisioned with the same default router address, the actual
        default router for a given host will be one of the PEs 
        attached to the same Ethernet segment as the host.  This
        provisioning method ensures that IP packets from a given host are
        handled by the closest EVPN PE that supports IRB.  
      </t>
      <t>
        In the topology of <xref target="two_router_irb" format="default"/>, one could
        imagine that H1 is configured with a default router address that
        belongs to PE2 but not to PE1.  Inter-subnet routing would still
        work, but IP packets from H1 to H3 would then follow the non-optimal
        path H1--&gt;PE1--&gt;PE2--&gt;PE1--&gt;H3. Sending traffic on this sort of
        path, where it leaves a router and then comes back to the same
        router, is sometimes known as "hairpinning".  Similarly, if PE2
        supports IRB but PE1 dos not, the same non-optimal path from H1 to
        H3 would have to be followed.  To avoid hairpinning, each EVPN PE
        needs to support IRB.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is worth pointing out the way IRB interfaces interact with
        multicast traffic.  Referring again to <xref target="two_router_irb" format="default"/>, suppose PE1 and PE2 are functioning as IP
        multicast routers. Also, suppose that H3 transmits a multicast packet
        and both H1 and H4 are interested in receiving that packet.  PE1
        will receive the packet from H3 via its IRB2 interface.  The
        Ethernet encapsulation from BD2 is removed, the IP header processing
        is done, and the packet is then re-encapsulated for BD1, with PE1's
        MAC address in the MAC Source Address field.  Then, the packet is
        sent down the IRB1 interface.  Layer 2 procedures (as defined in
        <xref target="RFC7432" format="default"/>) would then be used to deliver a copy of the
        packet locally to H1 and remotely to H4.
      </t>
