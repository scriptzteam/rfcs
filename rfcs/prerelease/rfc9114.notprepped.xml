      <t>The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable in a
transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control, and
low-latency connection establishment.  This document describes a mapping of HTTP
semantics over QUIC.  This document also identifies HTTP/2 features that are
subsumed by QUIC and describes how HTTP/2 extensions can be ported to HTTP/3.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>HTTP semantics (<xref target='RFC9110'/>) are used for a broad range of services on the
Internet. These semantics have most commonly been used with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
HTTP/1.1 has been used over a variety of transport and session layers, while
HTTP/2 has been used primarily with TLS over TCP. HTTP/3 supports the same
semantics over a new transport protocol: QUIC.</t>
      <section anchor='prior-versions-of-http'>
        <name>Prior Versions of HTTP</name>
        <t>HTTP/1.1 (<xref target='RFC9112'/>) uses whitespace-delimited text fields to convey HTTP
messages.  While these exchanges are human readable, using whitespace for
message formatting leads to parsing complexity and excessive tolerance of
variant behavior.</t>
        <t>Because HTTP/1.1 does not include a multiplexing layer, multiple TCP connections
are often used to service requests in parallel. However, that has a negative
impact on congestion control and network efficiency, since TCP does not share
congestion control across multiple connections.</t>
        <t>HTTP/2 (<xref target='RFC9113'/>) introduced a binary framing and multiplexing layer
to improve latency without modifying the transport layer.  However, because the
parallel nature of HTTP/2's multiplexing is not visible to TCP's loss recovery
mechanisms, a lost or reordered packet causes all active transactions to
experience a stall regardless of whether that transaction was directly impacted
by the lost packet.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor='delegation-to-quic'>
        <name>Delegation to QUIC</name>
        <t>The QUIC transport protocol incorporates stream multiplexing and per-stream flow
control, similar to that provided by the HTTP/2 framing layer. By providing
reliability at the stream level and congestion control across the entire
connection, QUIC has the capability to improve the performance of HTTP compared
to a TCP mapping.  QUIC also incorporates TLS 1.3 (<xref target='TLS'/>) at the
transport layer, offering comparable confidentiality and integrity to running
TLS over TCP, with the improved connection setup latency of TCP Fast Open
(<xref target='TFO'/>).</t>
        <t>This document defines HTTP/3: a mapping of HTTP semantics over the QUIC
transport protocol, drawing heavily on the design of HTTP/2.  HTTP/3 relies on
QUIC to provide confidentiality and integrity protection of data; peer
authentication; and reliable, in-order, per-stream delivery. While delegating
stream lifetime and flow-control issues to QUIC, a binary framing similar to the
HTTP/2 framing is used on each stream. Some HTTP/2 features are subsumed by
QUIC, while other features are implemented atop QUIC.</t>
        <t>QUIC is described in <xref target='QUIC-TRANSPORT'/>.  For a full description of
HTTP/2, see <xref target='RFC9113'/>.</t>
      </section>

    <section anchor='http3-protocol-overview'>
      <name>HTTP/3 Protocol Overview</name>
      <t>HTTP/3 provides a transport for HTTP semantics using the QUIC transport protocol
and an internal framing layer similar to HTTP/2.</t>
      <t>Once a client knows that an HTTP/3 server exists at a certain endpoint, it opens
a QUIC connection. QUIC provides protocol negotiation, stream-based
multiplexing, and flow control.  Discovery of an HTTP/3 endpoint is described in
<xref target='discovery'/>.</t>
      <t>Within each stream, the basic unit of HTTP/3 communication is a frame
(<xref target='frames'/>).  Each frame type serves a different purpose.  For example, <xref format='none' target='frame-headers'>HEADERS</xref><iref item='HEADERS'/>
and <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frames form the basis of HTTP requests and responses
(<xref target='request-response'/>).  Frames that apply to the entire connection are
conveyed on a dedicated <xref format='none' target='control-streams'>control stream</xref><iref item='control stream'/>.</t>
      <t>Multiplexing of requests is performed using the QUIC stream abstraction, which
is described in <xref section='2' sectionFormat='of' target='QUIC-TRANSPORT'/>.  Each request-response pair
consumes a single QUIC stream.  Streams are independent of each other, so one
stream that is blocked or suffers packet loss does not prevent progress on other
streams.</t>
      <t>Server push is an interaction mode introduced in HTTP/2 (<xref target='RFC9113'/>) that
permits a server to push a request-response exchange to a client in anticipation
of the client making the indicated request.  This trades off network usage
against a potential latency gain.  Several HTTP/3 frames are used to manage
server push, such as <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/>, <xref format='none' target='frame-max-push-id'>MAX_PUSH_ID</xref><iref item='MAX_PUSH_ID'/>, and <xref format='none' target='frame-cancel-push'>CANCEL_PUSH</xref><iref item='CANCEL_PUSH'/>.</t>
      <t>As in HTTP/2, request and response fields are compressed for transmission.
Because HPACK (<xref target='HPACK'/>) relies on in-order transmission of
compressed field sections (a guarantee not provided by QUIC), HTTP/3 replaces
HPACK with QPACK (<xref target='RFC9204'/>). QPACK uses separate unidirectional streams to
modify and track field table state, while encoded field sections refer to the
state of the table without modifying it.</t>

        <name>Discovering an HTTP/3 Endpoint</name>
        <t>HTTP relies on the notion of an authoritative response: a response that has been
determined to be the most appropriate response for that request given the state
of the target resource at the time of response message origination by (or at the
direction of) the origin server identified within the target URI.  Locating an
authoritative server for an HTTP URI is discussed in <xref section='4.3' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>.</t>
        <t>The "https" scheme associates authority with possession of a certificate that
the client considers to be trustworthy for the host identified by the authority
component of the URI.  Upon receiving a server certificate in the TLS handshake,
the client          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 verify that the certificate is an acceptable match for the URI's
origin server using the process described in <xref section='4.3.4' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>. If
the certificate cannot be verified with respect to the URI's origin server, the
client          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
 consider the server authoritative for that origin.</t>
        <t>A client          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 attempt access to a resource with an "https" URI by resolving the
host identifier to an IP address, establishing a QUIC connection to that address
on the indicated port (including validation of the server certificate as
described above), and sending an HTTP/3 request message targeting the URI
to the server over that secured connection.  Unless some other mechanism is used
to select HTTP/3, the token "h3" is used in the Application-Layer Protocol
Negotiation (ALPN; see <xref target='RFC7301'/>) extension during the TLS handshake.</t>
        <t>Connectivity problems (e.g., blocking UDP) can result in a failure to establish
a QUIC connection; clients          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 attempt to use TCP-based versions of HTTP
in this case.</t>
        <t>Servers          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 serve HTTP/3 on any UDP port; an alternative service advertisement
always includes an explicit port, and URIs contain either an explicit port or a
default port associated with the scheme.</t>
        <section anchor='alt-svc'>
          <name>HTTP Alternative Services</name>
          <t>An HTTP origin can advertise the availability of an equivalent HTTP/3 endpoint
via the Alt-Svc HTTP response header field or the HTTP/2 ALTSVC frame
(<xref target='ALTSVC'/>) using the "h3" ALPN token.</t>
          <t>For example, an origin could indicate in an HTTP response that HTTP/3 was
available on UDP port 50781 at the same hostname by including the following
header field:</t>
          <sourcecode type='http-message'><![CDATA[
Alt-Svc: h3=":50781"
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>On receipt of an Alt-Svc record indicating HTTP/3 support, a client            <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 attempt
to establish a QUIC connection to the indicated host and port; if this
connection is successful, the client can send HTTP requests using the mapping
described in this document.</t>

        <section anchor='other-schemes'>
          <name>Other Schemes</name>
          <t>Although HTTP is independent of the transport protocol, the "http" scheme
associates authority with the ability to receive TCP connections on the
indicated port of whatever host is identified within the authority component.
Because HTTP/3 does not use TCP, HTTP/3 cannot be used for direct access to the
authoritative server for a resource identified by an "http" URI.  However,
protocol extensions such as <xref target='ALTSVC'/> permit the authoritative server
to identify other services that are also authoritative and that might be
reachable over HTTP/3.</t>
          <t>Prior to making requests for an origin whose scheme is not "https", the client            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 ensure the server is willing to serve that scheme. For origins whose scheme
is "http", an experimental method to accomplish this is described in
<xref target='RFC8164'/>. Other mechanisms might be defined for various schemes in the
future.</t>

 be defined by future specifications.</t>
        <t>QUIC version 1 uses TLS version 1.3 or greater as its handshake protocol.
HTTP/3 clients          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>

 send the Server Name Indication (SNI;
<xref target='RFC6066'/>) TLS extension unless an alternative mechanism to indicate the
target host is used.</t>
        <t>QUIC connections are established as described in <xref target='QUIC-TRANSPORT'/>. During

token "h3" in the TLS handshake.  Support for other application-layer protocols          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 be offered in the same handshake.</t>
        <t>While connection-level options pertaining to the core QUIC protocol are set in

      <section anchor='connection-reuse'>
        <name>Connection Reuse</name>
        <t>HTTP/3 connections are persistent across multiple requests.  For best
performance, it is expected that clients will not close connections until it is
determined that no further communication with a server is necessary (for
example, when a user navigates away from a particular web page) or until the
server closes the connection.</t>
        <t>Once a connection to a server endpoint exists, this connection          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 be reused for
requests with multiple different URI authority components.  To use an existing
connection for a new origin, clients          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 validate the certificate presented by
the server for the new origin server using the process described in <xref section='4.3.4' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>.  This implies that clients will need to retain the
server certificate and any additional information needed to verify that
certificate; clients that do not do so will be unable to reuse the connection
for additional origins.</t>
        <t>If the certificate is not acceptable with regard to the new origin for any
reason, the connection          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
 be reused and a new connection          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 be
established for the new origin.  If the reason the certificate cannot be
verified might apply to other origins already associated with the connection,
the client          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 revalidate the server certificate for those origins. For
instance, if validation of a certificate fails because the certificate has
expired or been revoked, this might be used to invalidate all other origins for
which that certificate was used to establish authority.</t>
        <t>Clients          <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>
 open more than one HTTP/3 connection to a given IP address
and UDP port, where the IP address and port might be derived from a URI, a
selected alternative service (<xref target='ALTSVC'/>), a configured proxy, or name
resolution of any of these. A client          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 open multiple HTTP/3 connections to the
same IP address and UDP port using different transport or TLS configurations but          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 avoid creating multiple connections with the same configuration.</t>
        <t>Servers are encouraged to maintain open HTTP/3 connections for as long as
possible but are permitted to terminate idle connections if necessary.  When
either endpoint chooses to close the HTTP/3 connection, the terminating endpoint          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 first send a <xref format='none' target='frame-goaway'>GOAWAY</xref><iref item='GOAWAY'/> frame (<xref target='connection-shutdown'/>) so that both
endpoints can reliably determine whether previously sent frames have been
processed and gracefully complete or terminate any necessary remaining tasks.</t>
        <t>A server that does not wish clients to reuse HTTP/3 connections for a particular

        <t>An HTTP request/response exchange fully consumes a client-initiated
bidirectional QUIC stream. After sending a request, a client          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 close the

 close the stream for sending. At

        <t>When a stream is closed, this indicates the end of the final HTTP message.
Because some messages are large or unbounded, endpoints          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 begin processing
partial HTTP messages once enough of the message has been received to make
progress.  If a client-initiated stream terminates without enough of the HTTP

        <t>A server can send a complete response prior to the client sending an entire

 discard complete responses as a result of
having their request terminated abruptly, though clients can always discard
responses at their discretion for other reasons.  If the server sends a partial
or complete response but does not abort reading the request, clients          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>

continue sending the content of the request and close the stream normally.</t>

          <t>Implementations            <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 cancel requests by abruptly terminating any directions of

means that some data from the stream was passed to some higher layer of software

allowing them to be retried later.</t>

      <section anchor='header-formatting'>
        <name>HTTP Fields</name>
        <t>HTTP messages carry metadata as a series of key-value pairs called "HTTP
fields"; see Sections <xref section='6.3' sectionFormat='bare' target='RFC9110'/> and <xref section='6.5' sectionFormat='bare' target='RFC9110'/> of <xref target='RFC9110'/>. For a listing of registered
HTTP fields, see the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry"
maintained at <eref brackets='angle' target='https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields/'/>.  Like HTTP/2, HTTP/3 has additional considerations related to
the use of characters in field names, the Connection header field, and
pseudo-header fields.</t>
        <t>Field names are strings containing a subset of ASCII characters. Properties of
HTTP field names and values are discussed in more detail in <xref section='5.1' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>. Characters in field names          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be converted to lowercase prior to
their encoding. A request or response containing uppercase characters in field
names          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be treated as <xref format='none' target='malformed'>malformed</xref><iref item='malformed'/>.</t>
        <t>HTTP/3 does not use the Connection header field to indicate connection-specific
fields; in this protocol, connection-specific metadata is conveyed by other
means.  An endpoint          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
 generate an HTTP/3 field section containing
connection-specific fields; any message containing connection-specific fields          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be treated as <xref format='none' target='malformed'>malformed</xref><iref item='malformed'/>.</t>
        <t>The only exception to this is the TE header field, which          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 be present in an
HTTP/3 request header; when it is, it          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
 contain any value other than
"trailers".</t>
        <t>An intermediary transforming an HTTP/1.x message to HTTP/3          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 remove
connection-specific header fields as discussed in <xref section='7.6.1' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>, or their messages will be treated by other HTTP/3 endpoints as
<xref format='none' target='malformed'>malformed</xref><iref item='malformed'/>.</t>
        <section anchor='field-compression'>
          <name>Field Compression</name>
          <t><xref target='RFC9204'/> describes a variation of HPACK that gives an encoder some control
over how much head-of-line blocking can be caused by compression.  This allows
an encoder to balance compression efficiency with latency.  HTTP/3 uses QPACK to
compress header and trailer sections, including the control data present in the
header section.</t>
          <t>To allow for better compression efficiency, the Cookie header field
(<xref target='COOKIES'/>)            <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 be split into separate field lines, each with one or
more cookie-pairs, before compression. If a decompressed field section contains
multiple cookie field lines, these            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be concatenated into a single byte
string using the two-byte delimiter of "<tt>;&nbsp;</tt>" (ASCII 0x3b, 0x20) before being
passed into a context other than HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, such as an HTTP/1.1
connection, or a generic HTTP server application.</t>

          <name>Header Size Constraints</name>
          <t>An HTTP/3 implementation            <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 impose a limit on the maximum size of the message
header it will accept on an individual HTTP message.  A server that receives a
larger header section than it is willing to handle can send an HTTP 431 (Request
Header Fields Too Large) status code (<xref target='RFC6585'/>).  A client can discard
responses that it cannot process.  The size of a field list is calculated based
on the uncompressed size of fields, including the length of the name and value
in bytes plus an overhead of 32 bytes for each field.</t>
          <t>If an implementation wishes to advise its peer of this limit, it can be conveyed
as a number of bytes in the <xref format='none' target='SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE'>SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE</xref><iref item='SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE'/> parameter. An
implementation that has received this parameter            <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>
 send an HTTP message
header that exceeds the indicated size, as the peer will likely refuse to
process it.  However, an HTTP message can traverse one or more intermediaries
before reaching the origin server; see <xref section='3.7' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>.  Because
this limit is applied separately by each implementation that processes the
message, messages below this limit are not guaranteed to be accepted.</t>

        <t>In HTTP/1.x, CONNECT is used to convert an entire HTTP connection into a tunnel
to a remote host. In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the CONNECT method is used to establish
a tunnel over a single stream.</t>
        <t>A CONNECT request          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be constructed as follows:</t>
        <ul spacing='normal'>
          <li>The :method pseudo-header field is set to "CONNECT"</li>
          <li>The :scheme and :path pseudo-header fields are omitted</li>
          <li>The :authority pseudo-header field contains the host and port to connect to
(equivalent to the authority-form of the request-target of CONNECT requests;
see <xref section='7.1' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>).</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The <xref format='none' target='request-streams'>request stream</xref><iref item='request stream'/> remains open at the end of the request to carry the data to
be transferred.  A CONNECT request that does not conform to these restrictions
is <xref format='none' target='malformed'>malformed</xref><iref item='malformed'/>.</t>
        <t>A proxy that supports CONNECT establishes a TCP connection (<xref target='RFC0793'/>) to the
server identified in the :authority pseudo-header field.  Once this connection
is successfully established, the proxy sends a <xref format='none' target='frame-headers'>HEADERS</xref><iref item='HEADERS'/> frame containing a 2xx
series status code to the client, as defined in <xref section='15.3' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>.</t>
        <t>All <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frames on the stream correspond to data sent or received on the TCP
connection. The payload of any <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frame sent by the client is transmitted by
the proxy to the TCP server; data received from the TCP server is packaged into
<xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frames by the proxy. Note that the size and number of TCP segments is not
guaranteed to map predictably to the size and number of HTTP <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> or QUIC STREAM
frames.</t>
        <t>Once the CONNECT method has completed, only <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frames are permitted to be sent
on the stream.  Extension frames          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 be used if specifically permitted by the
definition of the extension.  Receipt of any other known frame type          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be
treated as a <xref format='none' target='errors'>connection error</xref><iref item='connection error'/> of type <xref format='none' target='H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED'>H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED</xref><iref item='H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED'/>.</t>
        <t>The TCP connection can be closed by either peer. When the client ends the
<xref format='none' target='request-streams'>request stream</xref><iref item='request stream'/> (that is, the receive stream at the proxy enters the "Data Recvd"
state), the proxy will set the FIN bit on its connection to the TCP server. When
the proxy receives a packet with the FIN bit set, it will close the send stream
that it sends to the client. TCP connections that remain half closed in a
single direction are not invalid, but are often handled poorly by servers, so
clients          <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>
 close a stream for sending while they still expect to receive
data from the target of the CONNECT.</t>
        <t>A TCP <xref format='none' target='errors'>connection error</xref><iref item='connection error'/> is signaled by abruptly terminating the stream. A proxy
treats any error in the TCP connection, which includes receiving a TCP segment
with the RST bit set, as a <xref format='none' target='errors'>stream error</xref><iref item='stream error'/> of type <xref format='none' target='H3_CONNECT_ERROR'>H3_CONNECT_ERROR</xref><iref item='H3_CONNECT_ERROR'/>.</t>
        <t>Correspondingly, if a proxy detects an error with the stream or the QUIC
connection, it          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 close the TCP connection.  If the proxy detects that the
client has reset the stream or aborted reading from the stream, it          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 close
the TCP connection.  If the stream is reset or reading is aborted by the client,
a proxy          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 perform the same operation on the other direction in order to
ensure that both directions of the stream are cancelled. In all these cases, if
the underlying TCP implementation permits it, the proxy          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 send a TCP
segment with the RST bit set.</t>
        <t>Since CONNECT creates a tunnel to an arbitrary server, proxies that support
CONNECT          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 restrict its use to a set of known ports or a list of safe
request targets; see <xref section='9.3.6' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/> for more details.</t>

        <name>Server Push</name><iref item='push ID' primary='true'/>
        <t>Server push is an interaction mode that permits a server to push a
request-response exchange to a client in anticipation of the client making the
indicated request.  This trades off network usage against a potential latency
gain.  HTTP/3 server push is similar to what is described in
<xref section='8.2' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9113'/>, but it uses different mechanisms.</t>
        <t>Each server push is assigned a unique push ID by the server.  The push ID is
used to refer to the push in various contexts throughout the lifetime of the
HTTP/3 connection.</t>
        <t>The push ID space begins at zero and ends at a maximum value set by the
<xref format='none' target='frame-max-push-id'>MAX_PUSH_ID</xref><iref item='MAX_PUSH_ID'/> frame.  In particular, a server is not
able to push until after the client sends a <xref format='none' target='frame-max-push-id'>MAX_PUSH_ID</xref><iref item='MAX_PUSH_ID'/> frame.  A client sends
<xref format='none' target='frame-max-push-id'>MAX_PUSH_ID</xref><iref item='MAX_PUSH_ID'/> frames to control the number of pushes that a server can promise.  A
server          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 use push IDs sequentially, beginning from zero.  A client          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>

treat receipt of a <xref format='none' target='push-streams'>push stream</xref><iref item='push stream'/> as a <xref format='none' target='errors'>connection error</xref><iref item='connection error'/> of type <xref format='none' target='H3_ID_ERROR'>H3_ID_ERROR</xref><iref item='H3_ID_ERROR'/>
when no <xref format='none' target='frame-max-push-id'>MAX_PUSH_ID</xref><iref item='MAX_PUSH_ID'/> frame has been sent or when the stream
references a push ID that is greater than the maximum push ID.</t>
        <t>The push ID is used in one or more <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/> frames that carry the control
data and header fields of the request message.  These frames are sent on the
<xref format='none' target='request-streams'>request stream</xref><iref item='request stream'/> that generated the push.  This allows the server push to be
associated with a client request.  When the same push ID is promised on multiple
<xref format='none' target='request-streams'>request streams</xref><iref item='request stream'/>, the decompressed request field sections          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 contain the same
fields in the same order, and both the name and the value in each field          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be
identical.</t>
        <t>The push ID is then included with the <xref format='none' target='push-streams'>push stream</xref><iref item='push stream'/> that ultimately fulfills
those promises.  The <xref format='none' target='push-streams'>push stream</xref><iref item='push stream'/> identifies the push ID of
the promise that it fulfills, then contains a response to the promised request
as described in <xref target='request-response'/>.</t>
        <t>Finally, the push ID can be used in <xref format='none' target='frame-cancel-push'>CANCEL_PUSH</xref><iref item='CANCEL_PUSH'/> frames; see
<xref target='frame-cancel-push'/>.  Clients use this frame to indicate they do not wish to
receive a promised resource.  Servers use this frame to indicate they will not
be fulfilling a previous promise.</t>
        <t>Not all requests can be pushed.  A server          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 push requests that have the
following properties:</t>
        <ul spacing='normal'>
          <li>cacheable; see <xref section='9.2.3' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/></li>

        </ul>
        <t>The server          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 include a value in the :authority pseudo-header field for
which the server is authoritative.  If the client has not yet validated the
connection for the origin indicated by the pushed request, it          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 perform the
same verification process it would do before sending a request for that origin
on the connection; see <xref target='connection-reuse'/>.  If this verification fails,
the client          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
 consider the server authoritative for that origin.</t>
        <t>Clients          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 send a <xref format='none' target='frame-cancel-push'>CANCEL_PUSH</xref><iref item='CANCEL_PUSH'/> frame upon receipt of a <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/> frame
carrying a request that is not cacheable, is not known to be safe, that
indicates the presence of request content, or for which it does not consider the
server authoritative.  Any corresponding responses          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
 be used or cached.</t>
        <t>Each pushed response is associated with one or more client requests.  The push
is associated with the <xref format='none' target='request-streams'>request stream</xref><iref item='request stream'/> on which the <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/> frame was
received.  The same server push can be associated with additional client

streams</xref><iref item='request stream'/>.  These associations do not affect the operation of the protocol, but
they          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 be considered by user agents when deciding how to use pushed resources.</t>
        <t>Ordering of a <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/> frame in relation to certain parts of the response is
important. The server          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 send <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/> frames prior to sending <xref format='none' target='frame-headers'>HEADERS</xref><iref item='HEADERS'/>
or <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frames that reference the promised responses.  This reduces the chance
that a client requests a resource that will be pushed by the server.</t>
        <t>Due to reordering, <xref format='none' target='push-streams'>push stream</xref><iref item='push stream'/> data can arrive before the corresponding
<xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/> frame.  When a client receives a new <xref format='none' target='push-streams'>push stream</xref><iref item='push stream'/> with an
as-yet-unknown push ID, both the associated client request and the pushed
request header fields are unknown.  The client can buffer the stream data in
expectation of the matching <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/>. The client can use stream flow control
(<xref section='4.1' sectionFormat='of' target='QUIC-TRANSPORT'/>) to limit the amount of data a server may
commit to the pushed stream.  Clients          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 abort reading and discard data
already read from <xref format='none' target='push-streams'>push streams</xref><iref item='push stream'/> if no corresponding <xref format='none' target='frame-push-promise'>PUSH_PROMISE</xref><iref item='PUSH_PROMISE'/> frame is
processed in a reasonable amount of time.</t>
        <t>Push stream data can also arrive after a client has cancelled a push. In this
case, the client can abort reading the stream with an error code of
<xref format='none' target='H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED'>H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED</xref><iref item='H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED'/>. This asks the server not to transfer additional data and
indicates that it will be discarded upon receipt.</t>
        <t>Pushed responses that are cacheable (see <xref section='3' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9111'/>) can be
stored by the client, if it implements an HTTP cache. Pushed responses are
considered successfully validated on the origin server (e.g., if the "no-cache"
cache response directive is present; see <xref section='5.2.2.4' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9111'/>) at the
time the pushed response is received.</t>
        <t>Pushed responses that are not cacheable          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>

      <name>Stream Mapping and Usage</name>
      <t>A QUIC stream provides reliable in-order delivery of bytes, but makes no
guarantees about order of delivery with regard to bytes on other streams. In
version 1 of QUIC, the stream data containing HTTP frames is carried by QUIC
STREAM frames, but this framing is invisible to the HTTP framing layer. The
transport layer buffers and orders received stream data, exposing a reliable
byte stream to the application. Although QUIC permits out-of-order delivery
within a stream, HTTP/3 does not make use of this feature.</t>
      <t>QUIC streams can be either unidirectional, carrying data only from initiator to
receiver, or bidirectional, carrying data in both directions.  Streams can be
initiated by either the client or the server.  For more detail on QUIC streams,
see <xref section='2' sectionFormat='of' target='QUIC-TRANSPORT'/>.</t>
      <t>When HTTP fields and data are sent over QUIC, the QUIC layer handles most of

        <t>All client-initiated bidirectional streams are used for HTTP requests and
responses.  A bidirectional stream ensures that the response can be readily
correlated with the request.  These streams are referred to as request streams.</t>
        <t>This means that the client's first request occurs on QUIC stream 0, with
subsequent requests on streams 4, 8, and so on. In order to permit these streams
to open, an HTTP/3 server          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 configure non-zero minimum values for the
number of permitted streams and the initial stream flow-control window.  So as
to not unnecessarily limit parallelism, at least 100 request streams          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 be
permitted at a time.</t>
        <t>HTTP/3 does not use server-initiated bidirectional streams, though an extension

        <t>Unidirectional streams, in either direction, are used for a range of purposes.
The purpose is indicated by a stream type, which is sent as a variable-length
integer at the start of the stream. The format and structure of data that
follows this integer is determined by the stream type.</t>

        <t>Two stream types are defined in this document: <xref format='none' target='control-streams'>control streams</xref><iref item='control stream'/>
(<xref target='control-streams'/>) and <xref format='none' target='push-streams'>push streams</xref><iref item='push stream'/> (<xref target='push-streams'/>). <xref target='RFC9204'/> defines
two additional stream types. Other stream types can be defined by extensions to
HTTP/3; see <xref target='extensions'/> for more details. Some stream types are reserved
(<xref target='stream-grease'/>).</t>
        <t>The performance of HTTP/3 connections in the early phase of their lifetime is
sensitive to the creation and exchange of data on unidirectional streams.
Endpoints that excessively restrict the number of streams or the flow-control
window of these streams will increase the chance that the remote peer reaches
the limit early and becomes blocked. In particular, implementations should
consider that remote peers may wish to exercise reserved stream behavior
(<xref target='stream-grease'/>) with some of the unidirectional streams they are permitted
to use.</t>
        <t>Each endpoint needs to create at least one unidirectional stream for the HTTP
<xref format='none' target='control-streams'>control stream</xref><iref item='control stream'/>. QPACK requires two additional unidirectional streams, and other
extensions might require further streams. Therefore, the transport parameters
sent by both clients and servers          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 allow the peer to create at least three
unidirectional streams. These transport parameters          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 also provide at least
1,024 bytes of flow-control credit to each unidirectional stream.</t>
        <t>Note that an endpoint is not required to grant additional credits to create more
unidirectional streams if its peer consumes all the initial credits before
creating the critical unidirectional streams. Endpoints          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 create the HTTP
<xref format='none' target='control-streams'>control stream</xref><iref item='control stream'/> as well as the unidirectional streams required by mandatory
extensions (such as the QPACK encoder and decoder streams) first, and then
create additional streams as allowed by their peer.</t>
        <t>If the stream header indicates a stream type that is not supported by the
recipient, the remainder of the stream cannot be consumed as the semantics are
unknown. Recipients of unknown stream types          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 either abort reading of the
stream or discard incoming data without further processing.  If reading is
aborted, the recipient          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 use the <xref format='none' target='H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR'>H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR</xref><iref item='H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR'/> error code or a

 consider
unknown stream types to be a <xref format='none' target='errors'>connection error</xref><iref item='connection error'/> of any kind.</t>
        <t>As certain stream types can affect connection state, a recipient          <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>

discard data from incoming unidirectional streams prior to reading the stream
type.</t>
        <t>Implementations          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>

them.  However, stream types that could modify the state or semantics of
existing protocol components, including QPACK or other extensions,          <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>

          <t>The SETTINGS frame (type=0x04) conveys configuration parameters that affect how
endpoints communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behavior.
Individually, a SETTINGS parameter can also be referred to as a "setting"; the
identifier and value of each setting parameter can be referred to as a "setting
identifier" and a "setting value".</t>

          <t>SETTINGS parameters are not negotiated; they describe characteristics of the
sending peer that can be used by the receiving peer. However, a negotiation
can be implied by the use of SETTINGS: each peer uses SETTINGS to advertise a
set of supported values. The definition of the setting would describe how each
peer combines the two sets to conclude which choice will be used.  SETTINGS does
not provide a mechanism to identify when the choice takes effect.</t>
          <t>Different values for the same parameter can be advertised by each peer. For
example, a client might be willing to consume a very large response field
section, while servers are more cautious about request size.</t>
          <t>The same setting identifier            <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>

 wait indefinitely for SETTINGS to

            <t>When a 0-RTT QUIC connection is being used, the initial value of each server

            <t>A server can remember the settings that it advertised or store an

      <t>When a stream cannot be completed successfully, QUIC allows the application to
abruptly terminate (reset) that stream and communicate a reason; see <xref section='2.4' sectionFormat='of' target='QUIC-TRANSPORT'/>. This is referred to as a "stream error". An HTTP/3
implementation can decide to close a QUIC stream and communicate the type of
error. Wire encodings of error codes are defined in <xref target='http-error-codes'/>.
Stream errors are distinct from HTTP status codes that indicate error
conditions. Stream errors indicate that the sender did not transfer or consume
the full request or response, while HTTP status codes indicate the result of a
request that was successfully received.</t>
      <t>If an entire connection needs to be terminated, QUIC similarly provides
mechanisms to communicate a reason; see <xref section='5.3' sectionFormat='of' target='QUIC-TRANSPORT'/>.  This
is referred to as a "connection error".  Similar to stream errors, an HTTP/3
implementation can terminate a QUIC connection and communicate the reason using
an error code from <xref target='http-error-codes'/>.</t>
      <t>Although the reasons for closing streams and connections are called "errors",
these actions do not necessarily indicate a problem with the connection or
either implementation. For example, a stream can be reset if the requested
resource is no longer needed.</t>
      <t>An endpoint        <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
 choose to treat a stream error as a connection error under
certain circumstances, closing the entire connection in response to a condition
on a single stream.  Implementations need to consider the impact on outstanding
requests before making this choice.</t>
      <t>Because new error codes can be defined without negotiation (see <xref target='extensions'/>),

      <name>Extensions to HTTP/3</name>
      <t>HTTP/3 permits extension of the protocol.  Within the limitations described in
this section, protocol extensions can be used to provide additional services or
alter any aspect of the protocol.  Extensions are effective only within the
scope of a single HTTP/3 connection.</t>
      <t>This applies to the protocol elements defined in this document.  This does not
affect the existing options for extending HTTP, such as defining new methods,
status codes, or fields.</t>
      <t>Extensions are permitted to use new frame types (<xref target='frames'/>), new settings
(<xref target='settings-parameters'/>), new error codes (<xref target='errors'/>), or new unidirectional
stream types (<xref target='unidirectional-streams'/>).  Registries are established for
managing these extension points: frame types (<xref target='iana-frames'/>), settings
(<xref target='iana-settings'/>), error codes (<xref target='iana-error-codes'/>), and stream types
(<xref target='iana-stream-types'/>).</t>
      <t>Implementations        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 ignore unknown or unsupported values in all extensible
protocol elements.  Implementations        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 discard data or abort reading on
unidirectional streams that have unknown or unsupported types.  This means that
any of these extension points can be safely used by extensions without prior
arrangement or negotiation.  However, where a known frame type is required to be
in a specific location, such as the <xref format='none' target='frame-settings'>SETTINGS</xref><iref item='SETTINGS'/> frame as the first frame of the
<xref format='none' target='control-streams'>control stream</xref><iref item='control stream'/> (see <xref target='control-streams'/>), an unknown frame type does not satisfy
that requirement and        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
 be treated as an error.</t>
      <t>Extensions that could change the semantics of existing protocol components        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>

be negotiated before being used.  For example, an extension that changes the
layout of the <xref format='none' target='frame-headers'>HEADERS</xref><iref item='HEADERS'/> frame cannot be used until the peer has given a positive
signal that this is acceptable.  Coordinating when such a revised layout comes
into effect could prove complex.  As such, allocating new identifiers for
new definitions of existing protocol elements is likely to be more effective.</t>
      <t>This document does not mandate a specific method for negotiating the use of an
extension, but it notes that a setting (<xref target='settings-parameters'/>) could be used
for that purpose.  If both peers set a value that indicates willingness to use
the extension, then the extension can be used.  If a setting is used for
extension negotiation, the default value        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
 be defined in such a fashion that
the extension is disabled if the setting is omitted.</t>

commit a large amount of state.  Header fields that are critical for routing can
appear toward the end of a header section, which prevents streaming of the
header section to its ultimate destination.  This ordering and other reasons,
such as ensuring cache correctness, mean that an endpoint likely needs to buffer
the entire header section.  Since there is no hard limit to the size of a field

of fields (<xref target='header-formatting'/>); the following concerns also apply to the use
of HTTP compressed content-codings; see <xref section='8.4.1' sectionFormat='of' target='RFC9110'/>.</t>
        <t>There are demonstrable attacks on compression that exploit the characteristics
of the web (e.g., <xref target='BREACH'/>).  The attacker induces multiple requests

in each, which reveals a shorter length when a guess about the secret is
correct.</t>

        <t>Padding can be used to obscure the exact size of frame content and is provided
to mitigate specific attacks within HTTP, for example, attacks where compressed
content includes both attacker-controlled plaintext and secret data (e.g.,
<xref target='BREACH'/>).</t>
        <t>Where HTTP/2 employs PADDING frames and Padding fields in other frames to make a
connection more resistant to traffic analysis, HTTP/3 can either rely on
transport-layer padding or employ the reserved frame and stream types discussed
in Sections <xref format='counter' target='frame-reserved'/> and <xref format='counter' target='stream-grease'/>.  These methods of
padding produce different results in terms of the granularity of padding, how
padding is arranged in relation to the information that is being protected,
whether padding is applied in the case of packet loss, and how an implementation
might control padding.</t>
        <t>Reserved stream types can be used to give the appearance of sending traffic even
when the connection is idle.  Because HTTP traffic often occurs in bursts,
apparent traffic can be used to obscure the timing or duration of such bursts,
even to the point of appearing to send a constant stream of data.  However, as
such traffic is still flow controlled by the receiver, a failure to promptly
drain such streams and provide additional flow-control credit can limit the
sender's ability to send real traffic.</t>
        <t>To mitigate attacks that rely on compression, disabling or limiting compression
might be preferable to padding as a countermeasure.</t>
        <t>Use of padding can result in less protection than might seem immediately
obvious.  Redundant padding could even be counterproductive.  At best, padding
only makes it more difficult for an attacker to infer length information by
increasing the number of frames an attacker has to observe.  Incorrectly
implemented padding schemes can be easily defeated.  In particular, randomized
padding with a predictable distribution provides very little protection;
similarly, padding payloads to a fixed size exposes information as payload sizes
cross the fixed-sized boundary, which could be possible if an attacker can
control plaintext.</t>

correlate actions of a single client or server over time.  These include the
value of settings, the timing of reactions to stimulus, and the handling of any
features that are controlled by settings.</t>
        <t>As far as these create observable differences in behavior, they could be used as
a basis for fingerprinting a specific client.</t>
        <t>HTTP/3's preference for using a single QUIC connection allows correlation of a
user's activity on a site.  Reusing connections for different origins allows
for correlation of activity across those origins.</t>
        <t>Several features of QUIC solicit immediate responses and can be used by an
endpoint to measure latency to their peer; this might have privacy implications
in certain scenarios.</t>

              <t>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
              <t>To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.

              <t>This document describes an experimental TCP mechanism called TCP Fast Open (TFO).  TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.  However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.  Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section.</t>

      <name>Considerations for Transitioning from HTTP/2</name>
      <t>HTTP/3 is strongly informed by HTTP/2, and it bears many similarities.  This
section describes the approach taken to design HTTP/3, points out important
differences from HTTP/2, and describes how to map HTTP/2 extensions into HTTP/3.</t>
      <t>HTTP/3 begins from the premise that similarity to HTTP/2 is preferable, but not
a hard requirement.  HTTP/3 departs from HTTP/2 where QUIC differs from TCP,
either to take advantage of QUIC features (like streams) or to accommodate
important shortcomings (such as a lack of total ordering). While HTTP/3 is
similar to HTTP/2 in key aspects, such as the relationship of requests and
responses to streams, the details of the HTTP/3 design are substantially
different from HTTP/2.</t>
      <t>Some important departures are noted in this section.</t>
      <section anchor='h2-streams'>
        <name>Streams</name>
        <t>HTTP/3 permits use of a larger number of streams (2<sup>62</sup>-1) than HTTP/2.
The same considerations about exhaustion of stream identifier space apply,
though the space is significantly larger such that it is likely that other
limits in QUIC are reached first, such as the limit on the connection
flow-control window.</t>
        <t>In contrast to HTTP/2, stream concurrency in HTTP/3 is managed by QUIC.  QUIC
considers a stream closed when all data has been received and sent data has been
acknowledged by the peer.  HTTP/2 considers a stream closed when the frame
containing the END_STREAM bit has been committed to the transport. As a result,
the stream for an equivalent exchange could remain "active" for a longer period
of time.  HTTP/3 servers might choose to permit a larger number of concurrent
client-initiated bidirectional streams to achieve equivalent concurrency to
HTTP/2, depending on the expected usage patterns.</t>
        <t>In HTTP/2, only request and response bodies (the frame payload of <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frames)
are subject to flow control.  All HTTP/3 frames are sent on QUIC streams, so all
frames on all streams are flow controlled in HTTP/3.</t>
        <t>Due to the presence of other unidirectional stream types, HTTP/3 does not rely
exclusively on the number of concurrent unidirectional streams to control the
number of concurrent in-flight pushes.  Instead, HTTP/3 clients use the
<xref format='none' target='frame-max-push-id'>MAX_PUSH_ID</xref><iref item='MAX_PUSH_ID'/> frame to control the number of pushes received from an HTTP/3
server.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor='h2-frames'>
        <name>HTTP Frame Types</name>
        <t>Many framing concepts from HTTP/2 can be elided on QUIC, because the transport
deals with them. Because frames are already on a stream, they can omit the
stream number. Because frames do not block multiplexing (QUIC's multiplexing
occurs below this layer), the support for variable-maximum-length packets can be
removed. Because stream termination is handled by QUIC, an END_STREAM flag is
not required.  This permits the removal of the Flags field from the generic
frame layout.</t>
        <t>Frame payloads are largely drawn from <xref target='RFC9113'/>. However, QUIC includes many
features (e.g., flow control) that are also present in HTTP/2. In these cases,
the HTTP mapping does not re-implement them. As a result, several HTTP/2 frame
types are not required in HTTP/3. Where an HTTP/2-defined frame is no longer
used, the frame ID has been reserved in order to maximize portability between
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 implementations. However, even frame types that appear in
both mappings do not have identical semantics.</t>
        <t>Many of the differences arise from the fact that HTTP/2 provides an absolute
ordering between frames across all streams, while QUIC provides this guarantee
on each stream only.  As a result, if a frame type makes assumptions that frames
from different streams will still be received in the order sent, HTTP/3 will
break them.</t>
        <t>Some examples of feature adaptations are described below, as well as general
guidance to extension frame implementors converting an HTTP/2 extension to
HTTP/3.</t>
        <section anchor='h2-diff-priority'>
          <name>Prioritization Differences</name>
          <t>HTTP/2 specifies priority assignments in PRIORITY frames and (optionally) in
<xref format='none' target='frame-headers'>HEADERS</xref><iref item='HEADERS'/> frames. HTTP/3 does not provide a means of signaling priority.</t>
          <t>Note that, while there is no explicit signaling for priority, this does not mean
that prioritization is not important for achieving good performance.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor='field-compression-differences'>
          <name>Field Compression Differences</name>
          <t>HPACK was designed with the assumption of in-order delivery. A sequence of
encoded field sections must arrive (and be decoded) at an endpoint in the same
order in which they were encoded. This ensures that the dynamic state at the two
endpoints remains in sync.</t>
          <t>Because this total ordering is not provided by QUIC, HTTP/3 uses a modified
version of HPACK, called QPACK.  QPACK uses a single unidirectional stream to
make all modifications to the dynamic table, ensuring a total order of updates.
All frames that contain encoded fields merely reference the table state at a
given time without modifying it.</t>
          <t><xref target='RFC9204'/> provides additional details.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor='flow-control-differences'>
          <name>Flow-Control Differences</name>
          <t>HTTP/2 specifies a stream flow-control mechanism. Although all HTTP/2 frames are
delivered on streams, only the <xref format='none' target='frame-data'>DATA</xref><iref item='DATA'/> frame payload is subject to flow control.
QUIC provides flow control for stream data and all HTTP/3 frame types defined in
this document are sent on streams. Therefore, all frame headers and payload are
subject to flow control.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor='guidance-for-new-frame-type-definitions'>
          <name>Guidance for New Frame Type Definitions</name>
          <t>Frame type definitions in HTTP/3 often use the QUIC variable-length integer
encoding.  In particular, stream IDs use this encoding, which allows for a
larger range of possible values than the encoding used in HTTP/2.  Some frames
in HTTP/3 use an identifier other than a stream ID (e.g., push IDs).
Redefinition of the encoding of extension frame types might be necessary if the
encoding includes a stream ID.</t>
          <t>Because the Flags field is not present in generic HTTP/3 frames, those frames
that depend on the presence of flags need to allocate space for flags as part
of their frame payload.</t>
          <t>Other than these issues, frame type HTTP/2 extensions are typically portable to
QUIC simply by replacing stream 0 in HTTP/2 with a <xref format='none' target='control-streams'>control stream</xref><iref item='control stream'/> in HTTP/3.
HTTP/3 extensions will not assume ordering, but would not be harmed by ordering,
and are expected to be portable to HTTP/2.</t>

        <t>In HTTP/3, setting values are variable-length integers (6, 14, 30, or 62 bits
long) rather than fixed-length 32-bit fields as in HTTP/2.  This will often
produce a shorter encoding, but can produce a longer encoding for settings that
use the full 32-bit space.  Settings ported from HTTP/2 might choose to redefine
their value to limit it to 30 bits for more efficient encoding or to make use
of the 62-bit space if more than 30 bits are required.</t>
        <t>Settings need to be defined separately for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The IDs of

          <name>Mapping between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Errors</name>
          <t>An intermediary that converts between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 may encounter error
conditions from either upstream. It is useful to communicate the occurrence of
errors to the downstream, but error codes largely reflect connection-local
problems that generally do not make sense to propagate.</t>
          <t>An intermediary that encounters an error from an upstream origin can indicate
this by sending an HTTP status code such as 502 (Bad Gateway), which is suitable
for a broad class of errors.</t>
          <t>There are some rare cases where it is beneficial to propagate the error by
mapping it to the closest matching error type to the receiver. For example, an
intermediary that receives an HTTP/2 <xref format='none' target='errors'>stream error</xref><iref item='stream error'/> of type REFUSED_STREAM from
the origin has a clear signal that the request was not processed and that the
request is safe to retry. Propagating this error condition to the client as an
HTTP/3 <xref format='none' target='errors'>stream error</xref><iref item='stream error'/> of type <xref format='none' target='H3_REQUEST_REJECTED'>H3_REQUEST_REJECTED</xref><iref item='H3_REQUEST_REJECTED'/> allows the client to take the
action it deems most appropriate. In the reverse direction, the intermediary
might deem it beneficial to pass on client request cancellations that are
indicated by terminating a stream with <xref format='none' target='H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED'>H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED</xref><iref item='H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED'/>; see
<xref target='request-cancellation'/>.</t>
          <t>Conversion between errors is described in the logical mapping. The error codes
are defined in non-overlapping spaces in order to protect against accidental
conversion that could result in the use of inappropriate or unknown error codes
for the target version. An intermediary is permitted to promote <xref format='none' target='errors'>stream errors</xref><iref item='stream error'/> to
<xref format='none' target='errors'>connection errors</xref><iref item='connection error'/> but they should be aware of the cost to the HTTP/3 connection
for what might be a temporary or intermittent error.</t>
