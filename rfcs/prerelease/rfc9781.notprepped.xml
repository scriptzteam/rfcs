<t>This document defines the Unprotected CWT Claims Set (UCCS), a data format for
representing a CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims Set without protecting it
by a signature, Message Authentication Code (MAC), or encryption.
UCCS enables the use of CWT claims in environments where protection is
provided by other means, such as secure communication channels or
trusted execution environments.
This specification defines a CBOR tag for UCCS and describes the UCCS
format, its encoding, and its processing considerations. It also discusses
security implications of using unprotected claims sets.</t>

<section anchor="introduction">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>A CBOR Web Token (CWT) as specified by <xref target="RFC8392"/> is always wrapped in a
CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) envelope <xref target="STD96"/>.
Among other things, COSE provides end-to-end data origin
authentication and integrity protection employed by <xref target="RFC8392"/> as well as
optional encryption for CWTs.
Under the right circumstances (<xref target="secchan"/>), a signature providing proof for authenticity and integrity can be
provided through the transfer protocol and thus omitted from the
information in a CWT without compromising the intended goal of authenticity
and integrity.
In other words, if communicating parties have a preexisting security
association, they can reuse it to provide authenticity and integrity
for their messages, enabling the basic principle of using resources
parsimoniously.
Specifically, if a mutually secured channel is established between two
remote peers, and if that secure channel provides the required
properties (as discussed below), it is possible to omit the protection
provided by COSE, creating a use case for unprotected CWT Claims Sets.
Similarly, if there is one-way authentication, the party that did not
authenticate may be in a position to send authentication information through
this channel that allows the already authenticated party to authenticate the
other party; this effectively turns the channel into a mutually
secured channel.</t>
      <t>This specification allocates a CBOR tag to mark Unprotected CWT Claims Sets
(UCCS) as such and discusses conditions for its proper use in the scope of
Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS <xref target="RFC9334"/>) for the
conveyance of RATS Conceptual Messages.</t>

      <t>This specification does not change <xref target="RFC8392"/>: A CWT as defined by <xref target="RFC8392"/> does not make use of
the tag allocated here; the UCCS tag is an alternative to using COSE
protection and a CWT tag.
Consequently, within the well-defined scope of a secure channel, it
can be acceptable and economic to use the contents of a CWT without
its COSE container and tag it with a UCCS CBOR tag for further
processing within that scope -- or to use the contents of a UCCS CBOR
tag for building a CWT to be signed by some entity that can vouch for
those contents.</t>

        <name>Structure of This Document</name>
        <t><xref target="usage"/> briefly discusses use cases for UCCS.
<xref target="secchan"/> addresses general characteristics of secure channels,
followed by a specific discussion of using them in the context of RATS Conceptual
Message Conveyance in <xref target="uccs-rats"/>, and more
forward-looking considerations for using UCCS in other RATS contexts
are discussed in <xref target="other-rats"/>.
This is followed by the <xref format="title" target="iana"/>, <xref format="title" target="seccons"/>,
<xref format="title" target="sec-normative-references"/>, and <xref format="title" target="sec-informative-references"/>. 
The normative <xref target="cddl"/> provides a formal definition of the structure of
UCCS, as no
formal definition of CWT Claims Sets was provided in <xref target="RFC8392"/>.

This employs the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref
target="RFC8610"/>, using its ability to also describe in the same definition
the structurally similar use of JWT Claims Sets <xref target="RFC7519"/>,
without any protective wrapper (such as JWS) applied, as Unprotected JWT
Claims Sets (UJCS).

<xref target="example"/> provides an (informative) example for CBOR-Tagged UCCS.
The normative <xref target="eat"/> provides CDDL rules that add UCCS-format tokens to
Entity Attestation Tokens (EATs) <xref target="RFC9711"/> using its predefined
extension points.</t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="usage">
      <name>Deployment and Usage of UCCS</name>
      <t>Usage scenarios involving the conveyance of Claims (RATS, in particular)
require a standardized data definition and encoding format that
can be transferred
and transported using different communication channels.  As these are
Claims, the Claims Sets defined in <xref target="RFC8392"/> are
a suitable format.  However, the way these Claims are secured depends on the deployment, the security
capabilities of the device, as well as their software stack.  For example, a Claim may be securely
stored and conveyed using a device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) <xref target="RFC9397"/> or
a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) <xref target="TPM2"/>.
Especially in some resource-constrained environments,
the same process that provides the secure communication
transport is also the delegate to compose the Claim to be conveyed. Whether it is a transfer
or transport, a Secure Channel is presumed to be used for conveying such UCCS.  The following sections
elaborate on Secure Channel characteristics in general and further describe RATS usage scenarios and
corresponding requirements for UCCS deployment.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="secchan">
      <name>Characteristics of a Secure Channel</name>
      <t>A Secure Channel for the conveyance of UCCS needs to provide the security
properties that would otherwise be provided by COSE for a CWT.

In this regard, UCCS are similar in security considerations to JWTs <xref target="BCP225"/>
using the algorithm "none".  Section <xref target="RFC8725" section="3.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 8725 <xref target="BCP225"/> states:</t>
      <blockquote>
        <t>[...] if a JWT is cryptographically
protected end-to-end by a transport layer, such as TLS using
cryptographically current algorithms, there may be no need to apply another
layer of cryptographic protections to the JWT.  In such cases, the use of
the "none" algorithm can be perfectly acceptable.</t>
      </blockquote>
      <t>The security considerations discussed, e.g., in Sections <xref target="RFC8725" section="2.1" sectionFormat="bare"/>, <xref target="RFC8725" section="3.1" sectionFormat="bare"/>, and <xref target="RFC8725" section="3.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 8725 <xref target="BCP225"/> apply in an analogous way to the use of UCCS as
elaborated on in this document.
In particular, the need to "Use Appropriate Algorithms" (Section <xref target="RFC8725" section="3.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 8725 <xref target="BCP225"/>) includes choosing appropriate cryptographic
algorithms for setting up and protecting the Secure Channel.
For instance, their cryptographic strength should be at least as
strong as any cryptographic keys the Secure Channel will be used for
to protect in transport.
<xref target="tab-algsec"/> in <xref target="algsec"/> provides references to some more security
considerations for specific cryptography choices that are discussed in
the COSE initial algorithms specification <xref target="RFC9053"/>.</t>

      <t>Secure Channels are often set up in a handshake protocol that mutually
derives a session key, where the handshake protocol establishes the (identity and thus) authenticity of one or both ends of the communication.
The session key can
then be used to provide confidentiality and integrity of the transfer of
information inside the Secure Channel.
(Where the handshake did not provide a mutually secure channel,
further authentication information can be conveyed by the party not
yet authenticated, leading to a mutually secured channel.)
A well-known example of such a
Secure Channel setup protocol is the TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/> handshake; the
TLS record protocol can then be used for secure conveyance.</t>
      <t>As UCCS were initially created for use in RATS Secure Channels, the following
section provides a discussion of
their use in these channels.  Where other environments are intended to be
used to convey UCCS, similar considerations need to be documented before
UCCS can be used.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="uccs-rats">
      <name>UCCS in RATS Conceptual Message Conveyance</name>
      <t>This section describes a detailed usage scenario for UCCS in the
context of RATS in conjunction with its attendant security
requirements.
The use of UCCS tag 601 outside of the RATS context <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> come with additional instruction leaflets and security considerations.</t>
      <t>For the purposes of this section, any RATS role can be the sender or the receiver of the UCCS.</t>
      <t>Secure Channels can be transient in nature.  For the purposes of this
specification, the mechanisms used to establish a Secure Channel are out of
scope.</t>
      <t>In the scope of RATS Claims, the receiver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
authenticate the sender as part of the establishment of the Secure Channel.
Furthermore, the channel <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide integrity of the communication between the
communicating RATS roles.
For data confidentiality <xref target="RFC4949"/>, the receiving side <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
authenticated as well. This is achieved if the sender and receiver
mutually authenticate when establishing the Secure Channel.
The quality of the receiver's authentication and authorization will
influence whether the sender can disclose the UCCS.</t>
      <t>The extent to which a Secure Channel can provide assurances that UCCS
originate from a trustworthy Attesting Environment depends on the
characteristics of both the cryptographic mechanisms used to establish the
channel and the characteristics of the Attesting Environment itself.
The assurance provided to a Relying Party depends, among others, on the authenticity
and integrity properties of the Secure Channel used for conveying
the UCCS to the Relying Party.</t>
      <t>Ultimately, it is up to the receiver's policy to determine whether to accept
a UCCS from the sender and to determine the type of Secure Channel it must negotiate.
While the security considerations of the cryptographic algorithms used are similar
to COSE, the considerations of the Secure Channel should also adhere to the policy
configured at each of end of the Secure Channel.  However, the policy controls
and definitions are out of scope for this document.</t>
      <t>Where an Attesting Environment serves as an endpoint of a Secure
Channel used to convey a UCCS, the security assurance required of that
Attesting Environment by a Relying Party generally calls for the
Attesting Environment to be implemented using techniques designed to
provide enhanced protection from an attacker wishing to tamper with or
forge a UCCS originating from that Attesting Environment.
A possible approach might be to implement the Attesting Environment in
a hardened environment, such as a TEE <xref target="RFC9397"/> or a TPM <xref target="TPM2"/>.</t>

      <t>When a UCCS emerges from the Secure Channel and into the receiver, the security
properties of the secure channel no longer protect the UCCS, which is now subject to the same security properties
as any other unprotected data in the Verifier environment.
If the receiver subsequently forwards UCCS, they are treated as though they originated within the receiver.</t>
      <t>The Secure Channel context does not govern fully formed CWTs in the
same way it governs UCCS.
As with EATs (see <xref target="RFC9711"/>) nested in other EATs (Section <xref target="RFC9711" section="4.2.18.3" sectionFormat="bare">Nested Tokens</xref> of <xref target="RFC9711"/>), the Secure
Channel does not endorse fully formed CWTs transferred through it.
Effectively, the COSE envelope of a CWT (or a nested EAT) shields the
CWT Claims Set from the endorsement of the secure channel.
(Note that a nested UCCS Claim might be added to EAT, and this statement does not apply to UCCS nested into UCCS; it only applies to
fully formed CWTs.)</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="other-rats">
      <name>Considerations for Using UCCS in Other RATS Contexts</name>
      <t>This section discusses two additional usage scenarios for UCCS in the
context of RATS.</t>
      <section anchor="delegated-attestation">
        <name>Delegated Attestation</name>
        <t>Another usage scenario is that of a sub-Attester that has no signing
keys (for example, to keep the implementation complexity to a minimum)
and has a Secure Channel, such as local inter-process communication,
to interact with a lead Attester (see "Composite Device", <xref section="3.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9334"/>).
The sub-Attester produces a UCCS with the required CWT Claims Set and sends the UCCS through the Secure Channel to the lead Attester.
The lead Attester then computes a cryptographic hash of the UCCS and
protects that hash using its signing key for Evidence, for example,
using a Detached-Submodule-Digest or Detached EAT Bundle (<xref section="5" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9711"/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="privacy-preservation">
        <name>Privacy Preservation</name>
        <t>A Secure Channel that preserves the privacy of the Attester may provide
security properties equivalent to COSE, but only inside the life-span of the
session established.  In general, when a privacy-preserving Secure
Channel is employed to convey a conceptual message, the receiver
cannot correlate the message with the senders of
other received UCCS messages beyond the information the Secure Channel
authentication provides.</t>
        <t>An Attester must consider whether any UCCS it returns over a privacy-preserving Secure Channel compromises the privacy in unacceptable ways.  As
an example, the use of the EAT UEID Claim (<xref section="4.2.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9711"/>) in UCCS over a privacy-preserving Secure Channel allows a Verifier to correlate UCCS from a single
Attesting Environment across many Secure Channel sessions. This may be
acceptable in some use cases (e.g., if the Attesting Environment is a
physical sensor in a factory) and unacceptable in others (e.g., if the
Attesting Environment is a user device belonging to a child).</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="STD94"/> apply.
The security considerations of <xref target="RFC8392"/> need to be applied analogously,
replacing the function of COSE with that of the Secure Channel; in
particular, "it is not only important to protect the CWT in transit but also to ensure that the recipient can authenticate the party that assembled the claims and created the CWT".</t>
      <t><xref target="secchan"/> discusses security considerations for Secure Channels in which
UCCS might be used.
This document provides the CBOR tag definition for UCCS and a discussion
on security consideration for the use of UCCS in RATS.  Uses of UCCS outside the scope of
RATS are not covered by this document.  The UCCS specification -- and the
use of the UCCS CBOR tag, correspondingly -- is not intended for use in a
scope where a scope-specific security consideration discussion has not
been conducted, vetted, and approved for that use.
In order to be able to use the UCCS CBOR tag in another such scope,
the secure channel and/or the application protocol (e.g., TLS and the
protocol identified by ALPN) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify the roles of the endpoints
in a fashion that the security properties of conveying UCCS via a
Secure Channel between the roles are well-defined.</t>
      <section anchor="general-considerations">
        <name>General Considerations</name>
        <t>Implementations of Secure Channels are often separate from the application
logic that has security requirements on them.  Similar security
considerations to those described in <xref target="STD96"/> for obtaining the
required levels of assurance include:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Implementations need to provide sufficient protection for private or
secret key material used to establish or protect the Secure Channel.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Using a key for more than one algorithm can leak information about the
key and is not recommended.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>An algorithm used to establish or protect the Secure Channel may have
limits on the number of times that a key can be used without leaking
information about the key.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Evidence in a UCCS conveyed in a Secure Channel generally cannot be
used to support trust in the credentials that were used to establish
that secure channel, as this would create a circular dependency.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The Verifier needs to ensure that the management of key material used to
establish or protect the Secure Channel is acceptable. This may include
factors such as:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Ensuring that any permissions associated with key ownership are respected
in the establishment of the Secure Channel.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Using cryptographic algorithms appropriately.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Using key material in accordance with any usage restrictions such as
freshness or algorithm restrictions.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Ensuring that appropriate protections are in place to address potential
traffic analysis attacks.</t>
