    <abstract>
      <t>The MPLS echo request and MPLS echo response messages, defined in RFC
      8029, "Detecting Multiprotocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data-Plane
      Failures" (usually referred to as LSP ping), are encapsulated in IP
      packets with headers that include a Router Alert Option (RAO). In actual
      deployments, the RAO was neither required nor used.  Furthermore, RFC
      6398 identifies security vulnerabilities associated with the RAO in
      non-controlled environments, e.g., the case of using the MPLS echo
      request/reply as inter-area Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
      (OAM), and recommends against its use outside of controlled
      environments.</t>
      <t>Therefore, this document retires the RAO for MPLS OAM and updates RFC
      8029 to remove the RAO from LSP ping message
      encapsulations. Furthermore, this document explains why RFC 7506 has
      been reclassified as Historic.</t>
      <t>Also, this document recommends the use of an IPv6 loopback address
      (::1/128) as the IPv6 destination address for an MPLS echo request
      message.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>"Detecting Multiprotocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data-Plane
  Failures" (usually referred to as LSP ping) <xref target="RFC8029" format="default"/> detects data plane failures in
  MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs). It can operate in "ping mode" or
  "traceroute mode." When operating in ping mode, it checks LSP connectivity.
  When operating in traceroute mode, it can trace an LSP
   and localize failures to a particular node along an LSP.</t>
      <t>The reader is assumed be familiar with <xref target="RFC8029" format="default"/> and its terminology.</t>
      <t>LSP ping defines a probe message called the "MPLS echo
      request." It also defines a response message called the
      "MPLS echo reply." Both messages are encapsulated in UDP and
      IP. The MPLS echo request message is further encapsulated in an MPLS label
      stack, except when all of the Forwarding Equivalency Classes in the
   stack correspond to Implicit Null labels.</t>
      <t>When operating in ping mode, LSP ping sends a single MPLS echo request
      message, with the MPLS TTL set to 255. This message
      is intended to reach the egress Label Switching Router (LSR). When
      operating in traceroute mode, MPLS ping sends multiple MPLS echo request
      messages as defined in <xref target="RFC8029" format="default" section="4.3"/>.
      It manipulates the MPLS TTL so that the first message expires
      on the first LSR along the path, and subsequent messages expire on
      subsequent LSRs.</t>
      <t>According to <xref target="RFC8029"/>, the IP header that encapsulates an MPLS echo
   request message must include a Router Alert Option (RAO). Furthermore,
   <xref target="RFC8029"/> also says that the IP header that encapsulates an MPLS echo
   reply message must include an RAO if the value of the Reply Mode in
   the corresponding MPLS echo request message is "Reply via an
   IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet with Router Alert." This document explains why an RAO was not needed in both cases.
   Furthermore, <xref target="RFC6398" format="default"/>
      identifies security vulnerabilities associated with the RAO in non-controlled environments, e.g., the case of
   using the MPLS echo request/reply as inter-domain OAM over the public Internet, and recommends against its use outside of controlled
   environments, e.g., outside a single administrative domain.</t>

<t>Therefore, this document updates RFC 8029 <xref target="RFC8029"/> to retire the RAO from both
   LSP ping message encapsulations and explains why RFC 7506 <xref target="RFC7506"/> has been reclassified as Historic.</t>

      <section anchor="echo-request" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>MPLS Echo Request</name>
        <t>While the MPLS echo request message must traverse every node in the
        LSP under test, it must not traverse any other nodes. Specifically, the
        message must not be forwarded beyond the egress Label Switching Router
        (LSR). To achieve this, a set of the mechanisms that are used concurrently
        to prevent leaking MPLS echo request messages has been defined in <xref target="RFC8029" format="default"/>:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	  <li>When the MPLS echo request message is encapsulated in IPv4, the IPv4
            destination address must be chosen from the subnet 127/8. When the
            MPLS echo request message is encapsulated in IPv6, the IPv6 destination
            address must be chosen from the subnet
            0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00:0/104.</li>
          <li>When the MPLS echo request message is encapsulated in IPv4, the IPv4
        TTL must be equal to 1.  When the MPLS echo request message is
        encapsulated in IPv6, the IPv6 Hop Limit must be equal to 1.
        For further information on the encoding of the TTL / Hop Limit in an
        MPLS echo request message, see <xref target="RFC8029" format="default" section="4.3"/>.</li>
          <li>When the MPLS echo request message is encapsulated in IPv4, the IPv4
            header must include an RAO with the option value set to "Router shall examine packet" <xref target="RFC2113" format="default"/>.
            When the MPLS echo request message is
            encapsulated in IPv6, the IPv6 header chain must include a
            hop-by-hop extension header and the hop-by-hop extension header
            must include an RAO with the option value set to MPLS OAM <xref target="RFC7506" format="default"/>.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Currently, all of these are required. However, any one is
        sufficient to prevent forwarding the packet beyond the egress LSR.</t>
        <t>Therefore, this document updates RFC 8029 <xref target="RFC8029"/> in that Requirement 3 is
        removed.</t>
        <t>No implementation that relies on the RAO to prevent packets from being
   forwarded beyond the egress LSR has been reported to the MPLS Working Group.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="echo-reply" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>MPLS Echo Reply</name>
        <t>An LSP ping replies to the MPLS echo request message with an MPLS echo
        reply message. Four reply modes are defined in <xref target="RFC8029" format="default"/>:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Do not reply</li>
          <li>Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet</li>
          <li>Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet with Router Alert</li>
          <li>Reply via application-level control channel</li>
        </ol>
        <t>The rationale for mode 3 is questionable, if not wholly misguided.
        According to RFC 8029 <xref target="RFC8029"/>, "If the normal IP return path is deemed
        unreliable, one may use 3 (Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet with
        Router Alert)."</t>
        <t>However, it is not clear that the use of the RAO increases the
        reliability of the return path. In fact, one can argue it decreases
        the reliability in many instances, due to the additional burden of
        processing the RAO. This document updates RFC 8029 <xref target="RFC8029"/> in that mode 3 is removed.</t>
        <t>No implementations of mode 3 have been reported to the MPLS Working Group.</t>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 8029</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC8029" format="default"/> requires that the IPv6 Destination Address
      used in IP/UDP encapsulation of an MPLS echo request packet be selected from
      the IPv4 loopback address range mapped to IPv6. Such packets do not have
      the same behavior as prescribed in <xref target="RFC1122" format="default"/> for an IPv4
      loopback addressed packet.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC4291" format="default"/> defines ::1/128 as the single IPv6 loopback
      address. Considering that, this specification updates <xref target="RFC8029" section="2.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> regarding the selection of an IPv6 destination
      address for an MPLS echo request message as follows:</t>

      <t>OLD:</t>
<blockquote>
      <t>The 127/8 range for IPv4 and that same range embedded in an
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address for IPv6 was chosen for a number of reasons.</t>
   <t>RFC 1122 allocates the 127/8 as the "Internal host loopback address"
   and states: "Addresses of this form <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> appear outside a host."
   Thus, the default behavior of hosts is to discard such packets.  This
   helps to ensure that if a diagnostic packet is misdirected to a host,
   it will be silently discarded.</t>
   <t>RFC 1812 <xref target="RFC1812"/> states:</t>
   <t indent="3">
     A router <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> forward, except over a loopback
     interface, any packet that has a destination address on network 127.  A
     router <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> have a switch that allows the network manager to
     disable these checks.  If such a switch is provided, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
     default to performing the checks.
   </t>
  <t>This helps to ensure that diagnostic packets are never IP forwarded.</t>
  <t>   The 127/8 address range provides 16M addresses allowing wide
   flexibility in varying addresses to exercise ECMP paths. Finally, as
   an implementation optimization, the 127/8 range provides an easy
   means of identifying possible LSP packets.</t>

          or IPv6 Flow Label <xref target="RFC6438"/> can be used as the source of entropy.</li>
      </ul>

<t>Additionally, this specification updates <xref target="RFC8029" section="2.2" sectionFormat="of" /> to

      <t>
      Resulting from the removal of the Reply mode 3 "Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet with Router Alert" (see <xref target="echo-reply"/>),
      this specification updates <xref target="RFC8029" section="4.5" sectionFormat="of" /> by removing the following text:</t>
<blockquote>
   If the Reply Mode in the echo request is "Reply via an
   IPv4 UDP packet with Router Alert", then the IP header <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain
   the Router Alert IP Option of value 0x0 <xref target="RFC2113"/> for IPv4 or 69
   <xref target="RFC7506"/> for IPv6. If the reply is sent over an LSP, the topmost
   label <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> in this case be the Router Alert label (1) (see <xref target="RFC3032"/>).
</blockquote>
   
   <t>Furthermore, this specification updates <xref target="RFC8029" section="4.3" sectionFormat="of" /> as follows:</t>
   <t>OLD:</t>
<blockquote>
