    <abstract>
      <t>The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
      Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different types
      of cost metrics. Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a
      single cost metric (namely, the generic "routingcost" metric), if an
      application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint cost request in
      order to identify a resource provider that offers better performance
      metrics (e.g., lower delay or loss rate), the base protocol does not
      define the cost metric to be used.</t>
      <t>This document addresses this issue by extending the specification to
      provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network
      delay, delay variation (a.k.a.&nbsp;jitter), packet loss rate, hop count, and
      bandwidth.</t>
      <t>There are multiple sources (e.g., estimations based on measurements or
      a Service Level Agreement) available for deriving a performance metric. This document
      introduces an additional "cost-context" field to the ALTO "cost-type"
      field to convey the source of a performance metric.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides a means for
      network applications to obtain network information so that the
      applications can identify efficient application-layer traffic patterns
      using the networks. Cost metrics are used in both the ALTO cost map
      service and the ALTO endpoint cost service in the ALTO base protocol
      <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Since different applications may use different cost metrics, the ALTO
      base protocol introduced the "ALTO Cost Metrics" registry (<xref target="RFC7285" section="14.2" sectionFormat="of"/>) as a systematic mechanism to allow
      different metrics to be specified. For example, a delay-sensitive
      application may want to use latency-related metrics, and a
      bandwidth-sensitive application may want to use bandwidth-related
      metrics. However, the ALTO base protocol has registered only a single
      cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost" metric (<xref target="RFC7285" section="14.2" sectionFormat="of"/>); no latency- or bandwidth-related metrics
      are defined in the base protocol.</t>
      <t>This document registers a set of new cost metrics (<xref target="costmetric" sectionFormat="bare"/>) to allow
      applications to determine where to connect based on network
      performance criteria, including delay- and bandwidth-related metrics.</t>

      <t>The first six metrics listed in <xref target="costmetric" sectionFormat="bare"/> (i.e., one-way delay,
      round-trip delay, delay variation, loss rate, residual bandwidth, and
      available bandwidth) are derived from the set of Traffic Engineering (TE)
      performance metrics commonly defined in OSPF <xref target="RFC3630" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7471" format="default"/>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC5305" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8570" format="default"/>, and BGP - Link State (BGP-LS)
      <xref target="RFC8571" format="default"/>. Deriving ALTO cost performance metrics
      from existing network-layer TE performance metrics, and making it exposed to ALTO, can be a typical
      mechanism used by network operators to deploy ALTO <xref target="RFC7971" format="default"/> <xref target="FlowDirector" format="default"/>. This
      document defines the base semantics of these metrics by extending them
      from link metrics to end-to-end metrics for ALTO. The "Semantics Based
      On" column specifies at a high level how the end-to-end metrics are
      computed from link metrics; details will be specified in the
      following sections.</t>
      <t>The Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay metric as defined in
      <xref target="RFC8570"/> and <xref target="RFC8571"/>, and Maximum (Link) Bandwidth as defined in <xref target="RFC3630"/> and <xref target="RFC5305"/>,
      are not listed in <xref target="costmetric" sectionFormat="bare"/> because they can be handled by applying the
      statistical operators defined in this document. The metrics related to
      utilized bandwidth and reservable bandwidth (i.e., Maximum Reservable (Link) Bandwidth and Unreserved Bandwidth as defined in <xref target="RFC3630"/> and <xref target="RFC5305"/>) are outside the scope of
      this document.</t>
      <t>The seventh metric in <xref target="costmetric"         
sectionFormat="bare"/> (the estimated TCP-flow throughput metric) provides an
      estimation of the bandwidth of a TCP flow, using TCP throughput
      modeling, to support use cases of adaptive applications <xref target="Prophet" format="default"/> <xref target="G2" format="default"/>. Note that other
      transport-specific metrics can be defined in the future. For example,
      QUIC-related metrics <xref target="RFC9000" format="default"/> can be considered
      when the methodology for measuring such metrics is more mature (e.g., see <xref target="I-D.corre-quic-throughput-testing" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>The eighth metric in <xref target="costmetric"         
sectionFormat="bare"/> (the hop count metric) is mentioned, but not defined, in the
      ALTO base protocol <xref target="RFC7285"/>; this document provides a definition for it.</t>
      <t>These eight performance metrics can be classified into two categories:
      those derived from the performance of individual packets (i.e., one-way
      delay, round-trip delay, delay variation, loss rate, and hop count) and
      those related to bandwidth/throughput (residual bandwidth, available
      bandwidth, and TCP throughput). These two categories are defined in
      Sections&nbsp;<xref format="counter" target="secpktmetrics"/> and <xref format="counter" target="secbwmetrics"/>, respectively. Note that
      all metrics except round-trip delay are unidirectional. An ALTO client
      will need to query both directions if needed.</t>
      <t>The purpose of this document is to ensure proper usage of these eight
      performance metrics in the context of ALTO. This document follows the
      guidelines defined in <xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="14.2"/>
on registering ALTO cost metrics. Hence, it
      specifies the identifier, the intended semantics, and the security
      considerations of each one of the metrics specified in <xref target="costmetric" sectionFormat="bare"/>.</t>
      <t>The definitions of the intended semantics of the metrics tend to be
      coarse grained and are for guidance only, and they may work well for ALTO. On
      the other hand, a performance measurement framework, such as the IP
      Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework, may provide more details for
      defining a performance metric. This document introduces a mechanism
      called "cost-context" to provide additional details, when they are
      available; see <xref target="sec3" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Following the ALTO base protocol, this document uses JSON to specify
      the value type of each defined metric. See <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/> for JSON data type specifications. In
      particular, <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/> specifies that cost values
      should be assumed by default to be 'JSONNumber'. When defining the value
      representation of each metric in <xref target="costmetric" sectionFormat="bare"/>, this document conforms to
      <xref target="RFC7285"/> but specifies additional, generic constraints on valid
      JSONNumbers for each metric. For example, each new metric in <xref target="costmetric" sectionFormat="bare"/>
      will be specified as non-negative (&gt;= 0); Hop Count is specified to
      be an integer.</t>
      <t>An ALTO server may provide only a subset of the metrics described in
      this document. For example, those that are subject to privacy concerns
      should not be provided to unauthorized ALTO clients. Hence, all cost
      metrics defined in this document are optional; not all of them need to
      be exposed to a given application. When an ALTO server supports a cost
      metric defined in this document, it announces the metric in its
      information resource directory (IRD) as defined in <xref target="RFC7285" section="9.2" sectionFormat="of"/>.</t>
      <t>An ALTO server introducing these metrics should consider related
      security issues. As a generic security consideration regarding reliability
      and trust in the exposed metric values, applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> 
      promptly stop using ALTO-based guidance if they detect that the exposed information
      does not preserve their performance level or even degrades it. <xref target="secsecconsider" format="default"/> discusses security considerations in
      more detail.</t>

      <name>Performance Metric Attributes</name>
      <t>The definitions of the metrics in this document are coarse grained,
      based on network-layer TE performance metrics, and for
      guidance only. A fine-grained framework as specified in <xref target="RFC6390" format="default"/> requires that the fine-grained specification of
      a network performance metric include six components: (1) Metric Name, (2)
      Metric Description, (3) Method of Measurement or Calculation, (4)
      Units of Measurement, (5) Measurement Points, and (6) Measurement
      Timing. Requiring that an ALTO server provide precise, fine-grained
      values for all six components for each metric that it exposes may not be
      feasible or necessary for all ALTO use cases. For example, an ALTO
      server computing its metrics from network-layer TE
      performance metrics may not have information about the method of
      measurement or calculation (e.g., measured traffic patterns).</t>
      <t>To address the issue and realize ALTO use cases for the metrics listed in <xref target="costmetric" sectionFormat="bare"/>, this document defines performance metric identifiers that can be
      used in the ALTO Protocol with the following well-defined items: (1) Metric Name, (2) Metric
      Description, (3) Units of Measurement, and (4) Measurement Points,
      which are always specified by the specific ALTO services; for example,
      the endpoint cost service is between the two endpoints. Hence, the ALTO
      performance metric identifiers provide basic metric attributes.</t>
      <t>To allow the flexibility of allowing an ALTO server to provide
      fine-grained information such as Method of Measurement or Calculation
      according to its policy and use cases, this document introduces context
      information so that the server can provide these additional details.</t>
      <section anchor="meta" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Performance Metric Context: "cost-context"</name>
        <t>The core additional details of a performance metric specify how
        the metric is obtained. This is referred to as the source of the
        metric. Specifically, this document defines three types of
        coarse-grained metric information sources: "nominal", "sla", and "estimation".</t>
        <t>For a given type of source, precise interpretation of a performance
        metric value can depend on specific measurement and computation
        parameters.</t>
        <t>To make it possible to specify the source and the aforementioned
        parameters, this document introduces an optional "cost-context" field
        to the "cost-type" field defined by the ALTO base protocol (<xref target="RFC7285" section="10.7" sectionFormat="of"/>) as follows:</t>
        <sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[    object {
      CostMetric   cost-metric;
      CostMode     cost-mode;
      [CostContext cost-context;]
      [JSONString  description;]
    } CostType;

    object {
      JSONString    cost-source;
      [JSONValue    parameters;]
    } CostContext;                   
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>"cost-context" will not be used as a key to distinguish among
        performance metrics. Hence, an ALTO information resource <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
        announce multiple CostType entries with the same "cost-metric", "cost-mode",
        and "cost-context". They must be placed into different information
        resources.</t>
        <t>The "cost-source" field of the "cost-context" field is defined as a
        string consisting of only ASCII alphanumeric characters
        (U+0030-U+0039, U+0041-U+005A, and U+0061-U+007A). The "cost-source" field is
        used in this document to indicate a string of this format.</t>
        <t>As mentioned above, this document defines three values for
        "cost-source": "nominal", "sla", and "estimation". The "cost-source"
        field of the "cost-context" field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be one that is registered in the "ALTO Cost
        Source Types" registry (<xref target="ianaconsider"/>).</t>
        <t>The "nominal" category indicates that the metric value is
        statically configured by the underlying devices. Not all metrics have
        reasonable "nominal" values. For example, throughput can have a
        nominal value, which indicates the configured transmission rate of the
        involved devices; latency typically does not have a nominal value.</t>
        <t>The "sla" category indicates that the metric value is derived from
        some commitment, which this document refers to as a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Some operators also use terms such as "target" or
        "committed" values. For an "sla" metric, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the
        "parameters" field provide a link to the SLA definition.</t>
        <t>The "estimation" category indicates that the metric value is
        computed through an estimation process. An ALTO server may compute
        "estimation" values by retrieving and/or aggregating information from
        routing protocols (e.g., see <xref target="RFC7471" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8570" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC8571" format="default"/>), traffic
        measurement management tools (e.g., the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) <xref target="RFC5357" format="default"/>), and measurement frameworks (e.g., IPPM),
        with corresponding operational issues. An illustration of potential
        information flows used for estimating these metrics is shown in <xref target="fig1"/>. <xref target="secopconsider" format="default"/> discusses in more detail the
        operational issues and how a network may address them. </t>

        <t>There can be multiple options available when choosing the "cost-source" category; the operator of an ALTO server will make that choice. If a

      <name>Packet Performance Metrics</name>
      <t>This section introduces ALTO network performance metrics on one-way
      delay, round-trip delay, delay variation, packet loss rate, and hop
      count. They measure the "quality of experience" of the stream of packets
      sent from a resource provider to a resource consumer. The measurements of
      each individual packet (pkt) can include the delay from the time when
      the packet enters the network to the time when the packet leaves the
      network (pkt.delay), whether the packet is dropped before reaching the
      destination (pkt.dropped), and the number of network hops that the packet
      traverses (pkt.hopcount). The semantics of the performance metrics
      defined in this section are that they are statistics computed from these
      measurements; for example, the x-percentile of the one-way delay is the
      x-percentile of the set of delays {pkt.delay} for the packets in the
      stream.</t>

          aggregation of the average loss rate is the sum of the
          link loss rates. But this default aggregation is valid
          only if two conditions are met: (1) link loss rates are low and (2) one assumes that each link's
          loss events are uncorrelated with every other link's loss
          events. When loss rates at the links are high but
          independent, the general formula for aggregating loss,
          assuming that each link is independent, is to compute end-to-end
          loss as one minus the product of the success rate for each
          link. Aggregation when losses at links are correlated can be
          more complex, and the ALTO server should be cognizant of
          correlated loss rates. For estimation using IPPM, the IPPM

      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>The exact measurement infrastructure, measurement conditions, and
      computation algorithms can vary between different networks and are outside
      the scope of this document. Both the ALTO server and the ALTO clients,
      however, need to be cognizant of the operational issues discussed in the
      following subsections.</t>
      <t>Also, the performance metrics specified in this document are similar
      in that they may use similar data sources and have similar issues in
      their calculation. Hence, this document specifies issues that the
      performance metrics might have in common and also discusses challenges
      regarding the computation of ALTO performance metrics (<xref target="comp-consider"/>).</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Source Considerations</name>
        <t>The addition of the "cost-source" field solves a key issue: an
        ALTO server needs data sources to compute the cost metrics described
        in this document, and an ALTO client needs to know the data sources to
        better interpret the values.</t>
        <t>To avoid information that is too fine grained, this document introduces
        "cost-source" to indicate only the high-level types of data sources:
        "estimation", "nominal", or "sla", where "estimation" is a type of
        measurement data source, "nominal" is a type of static configuration,
        and "sla" is a type that is based more on policy.</t>
        <t>For example, for "estimation", the ALTO server may use log servers or
        the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) system as its data source, as recommended by <xref target="RFC7971" format="default"/>. In particular, the cost metrics defined in
        this document can be computed using routing systems as the data
        sources.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Metric Timestamp Considerations</name>
        <t>Despite the introduction of the additional "cost-context"
        information, the metrics do not have a field to indicate the
        timestamps of the data used to compute the metrics. To indicate this
        attribute, the ALTO server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> return an HTTP Last-Modified value to
        indicate the freshness of the data used to compute the performance
        metrics.</t>
        <t>If the ALTO client obtains updates through an incremental update
        mechanism <xref target="RFC8895" format="default"/>, the client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> assume
        that the metric is computed using a snapshot at the time that is
        approximated by the receiving time.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Backward-Compatibility Considerations</name>
        <t>One potential issue introduced by the optional "cost-source" field
        is backward compatibility. Consider the case where an IRD defines two
        "cost-type" entries with the same "cost-mode" and "cost-metric", but one with
        "cost-source" being "estimation" and the other being "sla". In such a case, an
        ALTO client that is not aware of the extension will not be able to
        distinguish between these two types. A similar issue can arise even
        with a single "cost-type" whose "cost-source" is "sla": an ALTO client
        that is not aware of this extension will ignore this field and instead
        consider the metric estimation.</t>
        <t>To address the backward-compatibility issue, if a "cost-metric" is
        "routingcost" and the metric contains a "cost-context" field, then it
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be "estimation"; if it is not, the client <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> reject the
        information as invalid.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="comp-consider" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Computation Considerations</name>
        <t>The metric values exposed by an ALTO server may result from
        additional processing of measurements from data sources to compute
        exposed metrics. This may involve data processing tasks such as
        aggregating the results across multiple systems, removing outliers,
        and creating additional statistics. The computation of ALTO performance metrics can present two challenges.</t>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Configuration Parameter Considerations</name>
          <t>Performance metrics often depend on configuration parameters, and
          exposing such configuration parameters can help an ALTO client to
          better understand the exposed metrics. In particular, an ALTO server
          may be configured to compute a TE metric (e.g., packet loss rate) at
          fixed intervals, say every T seconds. To expose this information,
          the ALTO server may provide the client with two pieces of additional
          information: (1) when the metrics were last computed and (2) when
          the metrics will be updated (i.e., the validity period of the
          exposed metric values). The ALTO server can expose these two pieces
          of information by using the HTTP response headers Last-Modified and
          Expires.</t>
        </section>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Aggregation Computation Considerations</name>
          <t>An ALTO server may not be able to measure the performance metrics
          to be exposed. The basic issue is that the "source" information can
          often be link-level information. For example, routing protocols often measure
          and report only per-link loss and not end-to-end loss; similarly,
          routing protocols report link-level available bandwidth and not
          end-to-end available bandwidth. The ALTO server then needs to
          aggregate these data to provide an abstract and unified view that
          can be more useful to applications. The server should be aware that
          different metrics may use different aggregation computations. For
          example, the end-to-end latency of a path is the sum of the latencies
          of the links on the path; the end-to-end available bandwidth of a
          path is the minimum of the available bandwidth of the links on the
          path; in contrast, aggregating loss values is complicated by the
          potential for correlated loss events on different links in the
          path.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The properties defined in this document present no security
      considerations beyond those in Section <xref target="RFC7285"
      section="15" sectionFormat="bare"/> of the base ALTO
      specification <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>However, concerns addressed in Sections&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7285" section="15.1" sectionFormat="bare"/>, <xref target="RFC7285" section="15.2" sectionFormat="bare"/>, and <xref target="RFC7285" section="15.3" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref target="RFC7285" format="default"/> remain of utmost importance. Indeed,
      TE performance is highly sensitive ISP information;
      therefore, sharing TE metric values in numerical mode requires full
      mutual confidence between the entities managing the ALTO server and the
      ALTO client. ALTO servers will most likely distribute numerical TE
      performance to ALTO clients under strict and formal mutual trust
      agreements. On the other hand, ALTO clients must be cognizant of the
      risks attached to such information that they would have acquired outside
      formal conditions of mutual trust.</t>
      <t>To mitigate confidentiality risks during information transport of TE
      performance metrics, the operator should address the risk of ALTO
      information being leaked to malicious clients or third parties through
      such attacks as person-in-the-middle (PITM) attacks. As specified in
      Section&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7285" section="15.3.2"
sectionFormat="bare">"Protection Strategies"</xref> of <xref target="RFC7285"/>,
the ALTO server should authenticate ALTO
      clients when transmitting an ALTO information resource containing
      sensitive TE performance metrics. Section&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7285" section="8.3.5" sectionFormat="bare">"Authentication and Encryption"</xref> of <xref target="RFC7285"/> specifies that ALTO
      server implementations as well as ALTO client implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      support the "https" URI scheme <xref target="RFC9110" format="default"/> and
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.</t>

   <name>ALTO Cost Source Types Registry</name>
      <t>IANA has created the "ALTO Cost Source Types"
      registry. This registry serves two purposes. First, it ensures the
      uniqueness of identifiers referring to ALTO cost source types. Second,
      it provides references to particular semantics of allocated cost source
      types to be applied by both ALTO servers and applications utilizing ALTO
      clients.</t>
      <t>A new ALTO cost source type can be added after IETF Review <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>, to ensure that proper documentation regarding
      the new ALTO cost source type and its security considerations has been
      provided. The RFC(s) documenting the new cost source type should be detailed
      enough to provide guidance to both ALTO service providers and
      applications utilizing ALTO clients as to how values of the registered
      ALTO cost source type should be interpreted. Updates and deletions of ALTO
      cost source types follow the same procedure.</t>
      <t>Registered ALTO address type identifiers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> conform to the
      syntactical requirements specified in <xref target="meta" sectionFormat="bare"/>. Identifiers are to be
      recorded and displayed as strings.</t>
      <t>Requests to add a new value to the registry <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the
      following information: </t>
      <dl>
        <dt>Identifier:</dt><dd>The name of the desired ALTO cost source type.</dd>
        <dt>Intended Semantics:</dt><dd> ALTO cost source types carry with them
          semantics to guide their usage by ALTO clients. Hence, a document
          defining a new type should provide guidance to both ALTO service
          providers and applications utilizing ALTO clients as to how values
          of the registered ALTO endpoint property should be interpreted.</dd>
        <dt>Security Considerations:</dt><dd> ALTO cost source types expose
          information to ALTO clients. ALTO service providers should be made
          aware of the security ramifications related to the exposure of a
          cost source type.</dd>
