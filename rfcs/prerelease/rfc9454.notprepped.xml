   <abstract>
      <t>
        This document updates some OSPF terminology to be in line with inclusive language used in the industry.
        The IETF has designated "Guidance for NIST Staff on Using
        Inclusive Language in Documentary Standards" by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
        for its inclusive language guidelines. It is intended that all
        future OSPF documents use this revised terminology even when they reference the RFCs updated by this
        document.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document updates RFCs 2328, 4222, 4811, 5243, 5340, 5614, and 5838.

        This document updates some OSPF terminology to be in line with inclusive language used in the industry.
        The IETF has designated "Guidance for NIST Staff on Using
        Inclusive Language in Documentary Standards" by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <xref target="NISTIR8366"/> for its inclusive language guidelines.
        It is intended that all future OSPF documents use this revised terminology even when they reference the RFCs
        updated by this document.

      <t>
        This document updates <xref target="RFC2328"/>, <xref target="RFC4222"/>,
        <xref target="RFC4811"/>, <xref target="RFC5243"/>, <xref target="RFC5340"/>, <xref target="RFC5614"/>,

      <name>Update to RFC 2328</name>
      <t>
        The base OSPFv2 specification "OSPF Version 2" <xref target="RFC2328"/> defines the synchronization of
        databases as two routers forming a "master/slave" relationship.  All instances of these terms
        are replaced by "Leader/Follower", respectively.
      </t>
      <t>
	In the Database Description packet, the "master (MS) bit" is renamed the "Leader (L) bit".
      </t>
      <t>
        The operation of OSPFv2 is not modified. The Leader/Follower terminology and Leader (L) bit definition
        changes impact the following sections: "The Synchronization of Databases" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="7.2" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), "The Neighbor Data Structure" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="10" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), "Neighbor states" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="10.1" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), "Events causing neighbor state changes" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="10.2" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), "The Neighbor state machine" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="10.3" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), "Receiving Database Description Packets" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="10.6" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), "Sending Database Description Packets" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="10.8" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), "An Example" (Section <xref target="RFC2328" section="10.10" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>), and "The Database Description packet" (Appendix <xref target="RFC2328" section="A.3.3" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>).

    <section anchor="update4222" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 4222</name>
      <t>
        "Prioritized Treatment of Specific OSPF Version 2 Packets and
        Congestion Avoidance" <xref target="RFC4222"/> is a Best Current Practice (BCP) document.  In Appendix <xref target="RFC4222" section="C" sectionFormat="bare"/>, Item (2), there is an example OSFPv2 packet sequence that refers to the "slave" in a database exchange; this reference is renamed to "Follower".
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="update4811" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 4811</name>
      <t>
        "OSPF Out-of-Band Link State Database (LSDB) Resynchronization" <xref target="RFC4811"/> is an Informational document.
        Section <xref target="RFC4811" section="2.4" sectionFormat="bare"/> includes a Database Description packet (Figure 2) and a description of the attendant encoding
        changes for Out-of-Band Resynchronization. In the figure and the description, all instances of "MS" (when
        referring to the Database Description packet bit) are renamed to "L". There is also a reference to "Master" in
        this section that is renamed to "Leader".
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="update5243" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 5243</name>
      <t>
         "OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization" <xref target="RFC5243"/> is an Informational document.
        The Introduction (Section <xref target="RFC5243" section="1" sectionFormat="bare"/>) references "Master or Slave"; this is replaced by "Leader or Follower".
        Section <xref target="RFC5243" section="3" sectionFormat="bare"/> includes an example of the optimized database exchange. In this example, all instances of
        "Master" and "Slave" are renamed to "Leader" and "Follower", respectively.
      </t>
    </section>

      <section anchor="updatev6" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 5340</name>
      <t>
        The base OSPFv3 specification "OSPF for IPv6" <xref target="RFC5340"/> defines the Database Description process
        between two routers as one being "designated to be the master and the other is the slave".  All instances of these
        terms are replaced by "Leader/Follower", respectively.
      </t>
      <t>
	In the Database Description packet, the "Master/Slave (MS) bit" is renamed the "Leader (L) bit".
      </t>
      <t>
        The operation of OSPFv3 is not modified. The Leader/Follower terminology and Leader (L) bit definition
        changes impact "The Database Description Packet" (Appendix <xref target="RFC5340" section="A.3.3" sectionFormat="bare"/>).
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="update5614" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 5614</name>
      <t>
        "Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension of OSPF
        Using Connected Dominating Set (CDS) Flooding" <xref target="RFC5614"/> is an Experimental document.
        "Changes to the Neighbor State Machine" (Section <xref target="RFC5614" section="7.1" 
sectionFormat="bare"/>) contains modifications to the neighbor
        state machine that were updated from <xref target="RFC2328"/>. In the neighbor state machine modifications, all
        instances of "Master" and "Slave" are renamed to "Leader" and "Follower", respectively.
        Additionally, all instances of "MS" (when referring to the Database Description packet
        bit) are renamed to "L". And in "Receiving Database Description Packets" (Section <xref target="RFC5614" section="7.5" sectionFormat="bare"/>), "master or slave" is replaced by "Leader or Follower" in the parenthetical.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="update5838" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Update to RFC 5838</name>
      <t>
         "Support of Address Families in OSPFv3" <xref target="RFC5838"/> is a Standards Track document.
        "Database Description Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
        Specification for Non-IPv6 AFs" (Section <xref target="RFC5838" section="2.7" sectionFormat="bare"/>) contains a Database Description
        packet change figure that includes the MS bit. In this figure, the "MS" field is
        renamed the "L" field.
      </t>
            <t>
        Additionally, in the first paragraph of "Changes to the Hello Packet Processing" (Section <xref target="RFC5838" section="2.4" sectionFormat="bare"/>),
        the text is updated to remove the non-inclusive terms pertaining to
        unreachability handling as follows:
	    </t>

 <blockquote>
   When an OSPFv3 router does not support this specification and an
   interface is configured with the Instance ID corresponding to an
   IPv4 AF, packets could be routed toward this interface and
   dropped. This could happen due to misconfiguration or a router
   software downgrade. For example, an IPv4 packet
   could be received on an interface not supporting IPv4 since
   a router that doesn't support this specification can still
   include the interface in an SPF-calculated path as long as it
   establishes adjacencies using the Instance ID corresponding
   to the IPv4 AF. Note that OSPFv3 Router-LSAs and Network-LSAs are
   AF-agnostic.
