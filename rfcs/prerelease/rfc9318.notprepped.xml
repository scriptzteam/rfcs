      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops designed to
consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet, and to suggest
future directions for the Internet architecture.  This long-term planning
function of the IAB is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts
      performed by working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</t>
      <t>The Measuring Network Quality for End-Users workshop <xref target="WORKSHOP" format="default"/> was held
virtually by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on September 14-16, 2021.
This report summarizes the workshop, the topics discussed, and some preliminary
conclusions drawn at the end of the workshop.</t>
      <section anchor="problem-space" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Problem Space</name>
        <t>The Internet in 2021 is quite different from what it was 10 years ago. Today, it
is a crucial part of everyone's daily life. People use the Internet for their
social life, for their daily jobs, for routine shopping, and for keeping up
with major events. An increasing number of people can access a gigabit
connection, which would be hard to imagine a decade ago. Additionally, thanks to
improvements in security, people trust the Internet for financial
banking transactions, purchasing goods, and everyday bill payments.</t>
        <t>At the same time, some aspects of the end-user experience have not
improved as much.  Many users have typical connection latencies that
remain at decade-old levels.  Despite significant reliability
improvements in data center environments, end users also still often see
interruptions in service. Despite algorithmic advances in the field of
control theory, one still finds that the queuing delays in the
last-mile equipment exceeds the accumulated transit delays. Transport
improvements, such as QUIC, Multipath TCP, and TCP Fast Open, are still
not fully supported in some networks. Likewise, various advances in
the security and privacy of user data are not widely supported, such
as encrypted DNS to the local resolver.</t>
        <t>Some of the major factors behind this lack of progress is the popular
perception that throughput is often the sole measure of the quality of
Internet connectivity. With such a narrow focus, the Measuring Network
Quality for End-Users workshop aimed to discuss various topics:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>What is user latency under typical working conditions?</li>
          <li>How reliable is connectivity across longer time periods?</li>
          <li>Do networks allow the use of a broad range of protocols?</li>
          <li>What services can be run by network clients?</li>
          <li>What kind of IPv4, NAT, or IPv6 connectivity is offered, and are there
firewalls?</li>
          <li>What security mechanisms are available for local services, such as DNS?</li>
          <li>To what degree are the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity
	  of user communications guarded?</li>
          <li>Improving these aspects of network quality will likely depend on
measuring and exposing metrics in a meaningful way to all involved
parties, including to end users. Such measurement and exposure of
the right metrics will allow service providers and network operators
to concentrate focus on their users' experience and will
simultaneously empower users to choose the Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) that can deliver the best experience based on their needs.</li>
          <li>What are the fundamental properties of a network that contributes to
a good user experience?</li>
          <li>What metrics quantify these properties, and how can we collect such metrics in a
practical way?</li>
          <li>What are the best practices for interpreting those metrics and incorporating
them in a decision-making process?</li>
          <li>What are the best ways to communicate these properties to service providers
and network operators?</li>
          <li>How can these metrics be displayed to users in a meaningful way?</li>

      <name>Workshop Topics and Discussion</name>
      <t>The agenda for the three-day workshop was broken into four separate
sections that each played a role in framing the discussions. The
workshop started with a series of introduction and problem space
presentations (<xref target="introduction-section"/>), followed by metrics considerations
(<xref target="discussion-metrics" format="default"/>), cross-layer considerations
(<xref target="discussions-cross-layer" format="default"/>), and a synthesis discussion (<xref target="synthesis" format="default"/>).
After the four subsections concluded, a follow-on discussion was held
to draw conclusions that could be agreed upon by workshop participants
(<xref target="conclusions" format="default"/>).</t>
      <section anchor="introduction-section" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Introduction and Overviews</name>
        <t>The workshop started with a broad focus on the state of user Quality
of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) on the Internet today.
The goal of the introductory talks was to set the stage for the
workshop by describing both the problem space and the current
solutions in place and their limitations.</t>
        <t>The introduction presentations provided views of existing QoS and QoE
measurements and their effectiveness. Also discussed was the
interaction between multiple users within the network, as well as the
interaction between multiple layers of the OSI stack.  Vint Cerf
provided a keynote describing the history and importance of the
topic.</t>
        <section anchor="dicsucssion-intro-keynote" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Key Points from the Keynote by Vint Cerf</name>
          <t>We may be operating in a networking space with dramatically different
parameters compared to 30 years ago. This differentiation justifies
reconsidering not only the importance of one metric over the other
but also reconsidering the entire metaphor.</t>
          <t>It is time for the experts to look at not only adjusting TCP but
also exploring other protocols, such as QUIC has done lately. It's
important that we feel free to consider alternatives to TCP. TCP is
not a teddy bear, and one should not be afraid to replace it with a
transport layer with better properties that better benefit its users.</t>
          <t>A suggestion: we should consider exercises to identify desirable
properties. As we are looking at the parametric spaces, one can
identify "desirable properties", as opposed to "fundamental
properties", for example, a low-latency property. An example coming
from the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA): you want to know where the missile is now, not where it
was. Understanding drives particular parameter creation and selection
in the design space.</t>
          <t>When parameter values are changed in extreme, such as connectiveness,
alternative designs will emerge. One case study of note is the
interplanetary protocol, where "ping" is no longer indicative of
anything useful. While we look at responsiveness, we should not ignore
connectivity.</t>
          <t>Unfortunately, maintaining backward compatibility is painful. The work
on designing IPv6 so as to transition from IPv4 could have been done
better if the backward compatibility was considered.
It is too late for IPv6, but it is not too late to consider this issue for potential future problems.</t>
          <t>IPv6 is still not implemented fully everywhere.  It's been a long road
to deployment since starting work in 1996, and we are still not
there. In 1996, the thinking was that it was quite easy to implement
IPv6, but that failed to hold true. In 1996, the dot-com boom began,
where a lot of money was spent quickly, and the moment was not caught in
time while the market expanded exponentially. This should serve as a
cautionary tale.</t>
          <t>One last point: consider performance across multiple hops in the
Internet. We've not seen many end-to-end metrics, as successfully
developing end-to-end measurements across different network and
business boundaries is quite hard to achieve. A good question to ask
when developing new protocols is "will the new protocol work across
multiple network hops?"</t>
          <t>Multi-hop networks are being gradually replaced by humongous, flat
networks with sufficient connectivity between operators so that
systems become 1 hop, or 2 hops at most, away from each other
(e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon). The fundamental architecture of the
Internet is changing.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="discussion-introductions" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Introductory Talks</name>
          <t>The Internet is a shared network built on IP protocols using
packet switching to interconnect multiple autonomous networks. The
Internet's departure from circuit-switching technologies allowed it to
scale beyond any other known network design. On the other hand, the
lack of in-network regulation made it difficult to ensure the best
experience for every user.</t>
          <t>As Internet use cases continue to expand, it becomes increasingly more
difficult to predict which network characteristics correlate with
better user experiences. Different application classes, e.g., video
streaming and teleconferencing, can affect user experience in ways that are complex
and difficult to measure. Internet utilization shifts rapidly
during the course of each day, week, and year, which further
complicates identifying key metrics capable of predicting a good user
experience.</t>
          <t>QoS initiatives attempted to overcome these
difficulties by strictly prioritizing different types of
traffic. However, QoS metrics do not always correlate with user
experience. The utility of the QoS metric is further limited by the
difficulties in building solutions with the desired QoS
characteristics.</t>
          <t>QoE initiatives attempted to integrate the
psychological aspects of how quality is perceived and create
statistical models designed to optimize the user experience. Despite
these high modeling efforts, the QoE approach proved beneficial in
certain application classes. Unfortunately, generalizing the models
proved to be difficult, and the question of how different applications
affect each other when sharing the same network remains an open problem.</t>
          <t>The industry's focus on giving the end user more throughput/bandwidth
led to remarkable advances. In many places around the world, a home
user enjoys gigabit speeds to their ISP.  This
is so remarkable that it would have been brushed off as science
fiction a decade ago. However, the focus on increased capacity came at
the expense of neglecting another important core metric: latency. As
a result, end users whose experience is negatively affected by high
latency were advised to upgrade their equipment to get more
throughput instead. <xref target="MacMillian2021" format="default"/> showed that sometimes such an
upgrade can lead to latency improvements, due to the economical
reasons of overselling the "value-priced" data plans.</t>
          <t>As the industry continued to give end users more throughput, while
mostly neglecting latency concerns, application designs started to
employ various latency and short service disruption hiding techniques.
For example, a user's web browser performance experience is closely
tied to the content in the browser's local cache. While such
techniques can clearly improve the user experience when using stale
data is possible, this development further decouples user experience
from core metrics.</t>
          <t>In the most recent 10 years, efforts by Dave Taht and the bufferbloat
society have led to significant progress in updating queuing algorithms to
reduce latencies under load compared to simpler FIFO
queues. Unfortunately, the home router industry has yet to implement
these algorithms, mostly due to marketing and cost concerns. Most home
router manufacturers depend on System on a Chip (SoC) acceleration to
create products with a desired throughput. SoC manufacturers opt for
simpler algorithms and aggressive aggregation, reasoning that a
higher-throughput chip will have guaranteed demand. Because consumers
are offered choices primarily among different high-throughput devices,
the perception that a higher throughput leads to higher a QoS continues to strengthen.</t>
          <t>The home router is not the only place that can benefit from clearer
	  indications of acceptable performance for users.
Since users perceive the Internet via the lens of applications, it
is important that we call upon application vendors to adopt solutions
that stress lower latencies.  Unfortunately, while bandwidth is straightforward to
measure, responsiveness is trickier. Many applications have found a
set of metrics that are helpful to their realm but do not generalize
well and cannot become universally applicable. Furthermore, due to the
highly competitive application space, vendors may have economic
reasons to avoid sharing their most useful metrics.</t>

        <name>Metrics Considerations</name>
        <t>In the second agenda section, the workshop continued its discussion
about metrics that can be used instead of or in addition to available
bandwidth. Several workshop attendees presented deep-dive studies on
measurement methodology.</t>
        <section anchor="common-performance-metrics" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Common Performance Metrics</name>
          <t>Losing Internet access entirely is, of course, the worst user
experience. Unfortunately, unless rebooting the home router restores
connectivity, there is little a user can do other than contacting
their service provider. Nevertheless, there is value in the systematic
collection of availability metrics on the client side; these can help
the user's ISP localize and resolve issues faster while enabling
users to better choose between ISPs. One can measure availability
directly by simply attempting connections from the client side to
distant locations of interest. For example, Ookla's <xref target="Speedtest" format="default"/>
uses a large number of Android devices to measure network and cellular
availability around the globe. Ookla collects hundreds of millions of
data points per day and uses these for accurate availability
reporting. An alternative approach is to derive availability from the
failure rates of other tests. For example, <xref target="FCC_MBA" format="default"/> and
            <xref target="FCC_MBA_methodology" format="default"/> use thousands of off-the-shelf routers, with measurement software developed by
<xref target="SamKnows" format="default"/>. These routers perform an array of network tests and
report availability based on whether test connections were successful or
not.</t>
          <t>Measuring available capacity can be helpful to end users, but it is
even more valuable for service providers and application
developers. High-definition video streaming requires significantly
more capacity than any other type of traffic. At the time of the
workshop, video traffic constituted 90% of overall Internet traffic
and contributed to 95% of the revenues from monetization (via
subscriptions, fees, or ads). As a result, video streaming services,
such as Netflix, need to continuously cope with rapid changes in
available capacity. The ability to measure available capacity in
real time leverages the different adaptive bitrate (ABR) compression
algorithms to ensure the best possible user experience. Measuring
aggregated capacity demand allows ISPs to be
ready for traffic spikes. For example, during the end-of-year holiday
season, the global demand for capacity has been shown to be 5-7 times
higher than during other seasons.  For end users, knowledge of their
capacity needs can help them select the best data plan given their
intended usage. In many cases, however, end users have more than
enough capacity, and adding more bandwidth will not improve their
experience -- after a point, it is no longer the limiting factor in
user experience. Finally, the ability to differentiate between the
"throughput" and the "goodput" can be helpful in identifying when the
network is saturated.</t>
          <t>In measuring network quality, latency is defined as the time it takes
a packet to traverse a network path from one end to the other. At the
time of this report, users in many places worldwide can enjoy Internet
access that has adequately high capacity and availability for their
current needs. For these users, latency improvements, rather than
bandwidth improvements, can lead to the most significant improvements
in QoE. The established latency metric is a
round-trip time (RTT), commonly measured in milliseconds. However,
users often find RTT values unintuitive since, unlike other
performance metrics, high RTT values indicate poor latency and users
typically understand higher scores to be better. To address this,
<xref target="I-D.cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness" format="default"/> and <xref target="Mathis2021" format="default"/> present an inverse metric, called
"Round-trips Per Minute" (RPM).</t>
          <t>There is an important distinction between "idle latency" and "latency
under working conditions". The former is measured when the network is
underused and reflects a best-case scenario. The latter is measured
when the network is under a typical workload. Until recently, typical
tools reported a network's idle latency, which can be misleading. For
example, data presented at the workshop shows that idle latencies can
be up to 25 times lower than the latency under typical working
loads. Because of this, it is essential to make a clear distinction
between the two when presenting latency to end users.</t>
          <t>Data shows that rapid changes in capacity affect
latency. <xref target="Foulkes2021" format="default"/> attempts to quantify how often a rapid change
in capacity can cause network connectivity to become "unstable" (i.e.,
having high latency with very little throughput). Such changes in
capacity can be caused by infrastructure failures but are much more
often caused by in-network phenomena, like changing traffic
engineering policies or rapid changes in cross-traffic.</t>
          <t>Data presented at the workshop shows that 36% of measured lines have
capacity metrics that vary by more than 10% throughout the day and
across multiple days. These differences are caused by many variables,
including local connectivity methods (Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet), competing
LAN traffic, device load/configuration, time of day, and local
loop/backhaul capacity. These factor variations make measuring
capacity using only an end-user device or other end-network
measurement difficult. A network router seeing aggregated traffic from
multiple devices provides a better vantage point for capacity
measurements. Such a test can account for the totality of local
traffic and perform an independent capacity test. However, various
factors might still limit the accuracy of such a test. Accurate
	  capacity measurement requires multiple samples.</t>
          <t>As users perceive the Internet through the lens of applications, it
may be difficult to correlate changes in capacity and latency with the
quality of the end-user experience. For example, web browsers rely on
cached page versions to shorten page load times and mitigate
connectivity losses. In addition, social networking applications often
rely on prefetching their "feed" items. These techniques make the
core in-network metrics less indicative of the users' experience and
necessitates collecting data from the end-user applications themselves.</t>
          <t>It is helpful to distinguish between applications that operate on a
"fixed latency budget" from those that have more tolerance to latency
variance. Cloud gaming serves as an example application that requires
a "fixed latency budget", as a sudden latency spike can decide the
"win/lose" ratio for a player. Companies that compete in the lucrative
cloud gaming market make significant infrastructure investments, such
as building entire data centers closer to their users. These data
centers highlight the economic benefit that lower numbers of latency
spikes outweigh the associated deployment costs. On the other hand,
applications that are more tolerant to latency spikes can continue to
operate reasonably well through short spikes. Yet, even those
applications can benefit from consistently low latency depending on
usage shifts. For example, Video-on-Demand (VOD) apps can work
reasonably well when the video is consumed linearly, but once the user
tries to "switch a channel" or to "skip ahead", the user experience
suffers unless the latency is sufficiently low.</t>
          <t>Finally, as applications continue to evolve, in-application metrics
are gaining in importance. For example, VOD applications can assess
the QoE by application-specific metrics, such as
whether the video player is able to use the highest possible
resolution, identifying when the video is smooth or freezing, or other
similar metrics. Application developers can then effectively use these
metrics to prioritize future work. All popular video platforms
(YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, and others) have developed frameworks to
collect and analyze VOD metrics at scale. One example is the Scuba
framework used by Meta <xref target="Scuba" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>Unfortunately, in-application metrics can be challenging to use
for comparative research purposes. First, different applications
often use different metrics to measure the same phenomena. For
example, application A may measure the smoothness of video via "mean
time to rebuffer", while application B may rely on the "probability
of rebuffering per second" for the same purpose. A different
challenge with in-application metrics is that VOD is a significant source
of revenue for companies, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Netflix,
placing a proprietary incentive against exchanging the in-application
data. A final concern centers on the privacy issues resulting from
in-application metrics that accurately describe the activities and
preferences of an individual end user.</t>

          <name>Availability Metrics</name>
          <t>Availability is simply defined as whether or not a packet can be sent
and then received by its intended recipient.  Availability is naively
thought to be the simplest to measure, but it is more complex when
considering that continual, instantaneous measurements would be needed
to detect the smallest of outages.  Also difficult is determining the
root cause of infallibility: was the user's line down, was something in
the middle of the network, or was it the service with which the user
was attempting to communicate?</t>

        <section anchor="capacity-metrics" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Capacity Metrics</name>
          <t>If the network capacity does not meet user demands, the network quality
will be impacted. Once the capacity meets the demands, increasing capacity
won't lead to further quality improvements.</t>
          <t>The actual network connection capacity is determined by the equipment and the
lines along the network path, and it varies throughout the day and across
multiple days. Studies involving DSL lines in North America indicate that over
30% of the DSL lines have capacity metrics that vary by more than 10%
throughout the day and across multiple days.</t>
          <t>Some factors that affect the actual capacity are:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	    <li>Presence of a competing traffic, either in the LAN or in the WAN
environments. In the LAN setting, the competing traffic reflects the
multiple devices that share the Internet connection. In the WAN setting, the
competing traffic often originates from the unrelated network flows that
happen to share the same network path.</li>
            <li>Capabilities of the equipment along the path of the network connection,
including the data transfer rate and the amount of memory used for
buffering.</li>
            <li>Active traffic management measures, such as traffic shapers and policers
that are often used by the network providers.</li>
          </ol>
          <t>There are other factors that can negatively affect the actual line capacities.</t>
          <t>The user demands of the traffic follow the usage patterns and preferences of
the particular users. For example, large data transfers can use any available
capacity, while the media streaming applications require limited capacity to
function correctly. Videoconferencing applications typically need less
capacity than high-definition video streaming.</t>

          <name>Latency Metrics</name>
          <t>End-to-end latency is the time that a particular packet takes to traverse the
network path from the user to their destination and back.  The end-to-end
latency comprises several components:</t>
           <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	     <li>The propagation delay, which reflects the path distance and the individual
link technologies (e.g., fiber vs. satellite). The propagation doesn't depend
on the utilization of the network, to the extent that the network path
remains constant.</li>
            <li>The buffering delay, which reflects the time segments spent in the memory of
the network equipment that connect the individual network links, as well as
in the memory of the transmitting endpoint. The buffering delay depends on
the network utilization, as well as on the algorithms that govern the queued segments.</li>
            <li>The transport protocol delays, which reflect the time spent in
retransmission and reassembly, as well as the time spent when the transport
is "head-of-line blocked".</li>
            <li>Some of the workshop submissions that have explicitly called out the application
delay, which reflects the inefficiencies in the application layer.</li>
          </ol>
          <t>Typically, end-to-end latency is measured when the network is
idle. Results of such measurements mostly reflect the propagation
delay but not other kinds of delay. This report uses the term "idle
latency" to refer to results achieved under idle network conditions.</t>
          <t>Alternatively, if the latency is measured when the network is under
its typical working conditions, the results reflect multiple types of
delays. This report uses the term "working latency" to refer to such
results. Other sources use the term "latency under load" (LUL) as a
synonym.</t>
          <t>Data presented at the workshop reveals a substantial difference
between the idle latency and the working latency. Depending on the
traffic direction and the technology type, the working latency is
between 6 to 25 times higher than the idle latency:</t>

          <t>While historically the tooling available for measuring latency focused
on measuring the idle latency, there is a trend in the industry to
start measuring the working latency as well,
e.g., Apple's <xref target="NetworkQuality" format="default"/>.</t>
</section>
        <section anchor="measurement-case-studies" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Measurement Case Studies</name>
          <t>The participants have proposed several concrete methodologies for
measuring the network quality for the end users.</t>
          <t><xref target="I-D.cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness" format="default"/> introduced a methodology for measuring working latency
from the end-user vantage point. The suggested method incrementally
adds network flows between the user device and a server endpoint until
a bottleneck capacity is reached. From these measurements, a round-trip
latency is measured and reported to the end user. The authors
chose to report results with the RPM metric. The methodology had been
implemented in Apple's macOS Monterey.</t>
          <t><xref target="Mathis2021" format="default"/> applied the RPM metric to the results of more than
4 billion download tests that M-Lab performed from 2010-2021. During
this time frame, the M-Lab measurement platform underwent several
upgrades that allowed the research team to compare the effect of
different TCP congestion control algorithms (CCAs) on the measured
end-to-end latency. The study showed that the use of cubic CCA leads to
increased working latency, which is attributed to its use of larger
queues.</t>
          <t><xref target="Schlinker2019" format="default"/> presented a large-scale study that aimed to
establish a correlation between goodput and QoE on a
large social network. The authors performed the measurements at
multiple data centers from which video segments of set sizes were
streamed to a large number of end users. The authors used the goodput
and throughput metrics to determine whether particular paths were
congested.</t>
          <t><xref target="Reed2021" format="default"/> presented the analysis of working latency measurements collected as part of the Measuring Broadband America (MBA)
program by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The FCC does not include working latency in its yearly report
but does offer it in the raw data files. The authors used a
subset of the raw data to identify important differences in the
working latencies across different ISPs.</t>
          <t><xref target="MacMillian2021" format="default"/> presented analysis of working latency across
multiple service tiers. They found that, unsurprisingly, "premium"
tier users experienced lower working latency compared to a "value"
tier. The data demonstrated that working latency varies significantly
within each tier; one possible explanation is the difference in
equipment deployed in the homes.</t>
          <t>These studies have stressed the importance of measurement of working
latency. At the time of this report, many home router manufacturers
rely on hardware-accelerated routing that uses FIFO queues. Focusing
on measuring the working latency measurements on these devices and
making the consumer aware of the effect of choosing one manufacturer
vs. another can help improve the home router situation. The ideal
test would be able to identify the working latency and pinpoint
the source of the delay (home router, ISP, server side, or some network
node in between).</t>
          <t>Another source of high working latency comes from network routers
exposed to cross-traffic. As <xref target="Schlinker2019" format="default"/> indicated, these can
become saturated during the peak hours of the day. Systematic testing
of the working latency in routers under load can help improve both our
understanding of latency and the impact of deployed infrastructure.</t>

          <name>Metrics Key Points</name>
          <t>The metrics for network quality can be roughly grouped into the following:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	    <li>Availability metrics, which indicate whether the user can access
the network at all.</li>
            <li>Capacity metrics, which indicate whether the actual line capacity is
sufficient to meet the user's demands.</li>
            <li>Latency metrics, which indicate if the user gets the data in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Higher-order metrics, which include both the network metrics, such as
inter-packet arrival time, and the application metrics, such as the mean
time between rebuffering for video streaming.</li>
          </ol>
          <t>The availability metrics can be seen as a derivative of either the capacity (zero
capacity leading to zero availability) or the latency (infinite latency
leading to zero availability).</t>
          <t>Key points from the presentations and discussions included the following:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	    <li>Availability and capacity are "hygienic factors" -- unless an
application is capable of using extra capacity, end users will see
little benefit from using over-provisioned lines.</li>
            <li>Working latency has a stronger correlation with the user experience
than latency under an idle network load. Working latency can
exceed the idle latency by order of magnitude.</li>
            <li>The RPM metric is a stable metric, with positive values being
better, that may be more effective when communicating latency to
end users.</li>
            <li>The relationship between throughput and goodput can be effective in
finding the saturation points, both in client-side <xref target="I-D.cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness" format="default"/>
and server-side <xref target="Schlinker2019" format="default"/> settings.</li>
            <li>Working latency depends on the algorithm choice for addressing endpoint
congestion control and router queuing.</li>

        <name>Cross-Layer Considerations</name>
        <t>In the cross-layer segment of the workshop, participants presented
material on and discussed how to accurately measure exactly where
problems occur.  Discussion centered especially on the differences
between physically wired and wireless connections and the difficulties
of accurately determining problem spots when multiple different types
of network segments are responsible for the quality.  As an example,
<xref target="Kerpez2021" format="default"/> showed that a limited bandwidth of 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi bottlenecks the most frequently. In comparison, the wider bandwidth of
the 5 Ghz Wi-Fi has only bottlenecked in 20% of observations.</t>
        <t>The participants agreed that no single component of a network
connection has all the data required to measure the effects of the
network performance on the quality of the end-user experience.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Applications that are running on the end-user devices have the best
insight into their respective performance but have limited
visibility into the behavior of the network itself and are unable

          <li>ISPs have good insight into QoS
considerations but are not able to infer the effect of the QoS

approaches should be preferred so that no centralized entity has the

          <t>Commonly, there's a tight coupling between collecting performance

          <t>The ownership of the Internet is spread across multiple administrative
domains, making measurement of end-to-end performance data
difficult. Furthermore, the immense scale of the Internet makes
aggregation and analysis of this difficult. <xref target="Marx2021" format="default"/> presented a
simple logging format that could potentially be used to collect and
aggregate data from different layers.</t>
          <t>Another aspect of the cross-layer collaboration hampering measurement is
that the majority of current algorithms do not explicitly provide
performance data that can be used in cross-layer analysis. The IETF
community could be more diligent in identifying each protocol's key
performance indicators and exposing them as part of the protocol
specification.</t>
          <t>Despite all these challenges, it should still be possible to perform
limited-scope studies in order to have a better understanding of how

          <t>With the advent of the low latency, low loss, and scalable throughput
(L4S) congestion notification and control, there is an even higher
need for the transport protocols and the underlying hardware to work
in unison.</t>
          <t>At the time of the workshop, the typical home router uses a single
FIFO queue that is large enough to allow amortizing the lower-layer header
overhead across multiple transport PDUs. These designs worked well
with the cubic congestion control algorithm, yet the newer generation
of algorithms can operate on much smaller queues. To fully support latencies
less than 1 ms, the home router needs to work efficiently on sequential
transmissions of just a few segments vs. being optimized for large
packet bursts.</t>
          <t>Another design trait common in home routers is the use of packet
aggregation to further amortize the overhead added by the lower-layer
headers.  Specifically, multiple IP datagrams are combined into a
single, large transfer frame. However, this aggregation can add up to
10 ms to the packet sojourn delay.</t>
          <t>Following the famous "you can't improve what you don't measure" adage,
it is important to expose these aggregation delays in a way that would

        <t>Finally, in the synthesis section of the workshop, the presentations
and discussions concentrated on the next steps likely needed to make
forward progress. Of particular concern is how to bring forward
measurements that can make sense to end users trying to select
between various networking subscription options.</t>
        <section anchor="measurement-and-metrics-considerations" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Measurement and Metrics Considerations</name>
          <t>One important consideration is how decisions can be made and what actions
can be taken based on collected metrics.  Measurements must be integrated
with applications in order to get true application views of
congestion, as measurements over different infrastructure or via other
applications may return incorrect results.  Congestion itself can be a
temporary problem, and mitigation strategies may need to be different
depending on whether it is expected to be a short-term or long-term
phenomenon.  A significant challenge exists in measuring short-term
problems, driving the need for continuous measurements to ensure
critical moments and long-term trends are captured.  For short-term
problems, workshop participants debated whether an issue that goes
away is indeed a problem or is a sign that a network is properly
adapting and self-recovering.</t>
          <t>Important consideration must be taken when constructing metrics in
order to understand the results.  Measurements can also be affected by
individual packet characteristics -- differently sized packets typically have a
linear relationship with their delay. With this in mind,
measurements can be divided into a delay based on geographical
distances, a packet-size serialization delay, and a variable (noise)
delay.  Each of these three sub-component delays can be different and
individually measured across each segment in a multi-hop path.
Variable delay can also be significantly impacted by external factors,
such as bufferbloat, routing changes, network load sharing, and other
local or remote changes in performance.  Network measurements,
especially load-specific tests, must also be run long enough to ensure
that any problems associated with buffering, queuing, etc. are captured.
Measurement technologies should also distinguish between upstream and
downstream measurements, as well as measure the difference between
end-to-end paths and sub-path measurements.</t>

        <section anchor="end-user-metrics-presentation" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>End-User Metrics Presentation</name>
          <t>Determining end-user needs requires informative measurements and
metrics.  How do we provide the users with the service they need or
want? Is it possible for users to even voice their desires
effectively?  Only high-level, simplistic answers like "reliability",
"capacity", and "service bundling" are typical answers given in
end-user surveys.  Technical requirements that operators can consume,
like "low-latency" and "congestion avoidance", are not terms known to
and used by end users.</t>
          <t>Example metrics useful to end users might include the number of users
supported by a service and the number of applications or streams that
a network can support.  An example solution to combat networking
issues include incentive-based traffic management strategies (e.g., an
application requesting lower latency may also mean accepting lower
bandwidth).  User-perceived latency must be considered, not just
network latency -- user experience in-application to in-server
latency and network-to-network measurements may only be studying the
lowest-level latency.  Thus, picking the right protocol to use in a
measurement is critical in order to match user experience (for
example, users do not transmit data over ICMP, even though it is a
common measurement tool).</t>
          <t>In-application measurements should consider how to measure different
types of applications, such as video streaming, file sharing,
multi-user gaming, and real-time voice communications.  It may be that
asking users for what trade-offs they are willing to accept would be a
helpful approach: would they rather have a network with low latency
or a network with higher bandwidth?  Gamers may make different
decisions than home office users or content producers, for example.</t>
          <t>Furthermore, how can users make these trade-offs in a fair manner that
does not impact other users? There is a tension between solutions in
this space vs. the cost associated with solving these problems, as well as
which customers are willing to front these improvement costs.</t>
          <t>Challenges in providing higher-priority traffic to users centers
around the ability for networks to be willing to listen to client
requests for higher incentives, even though commercial interests may
not flow to them without a cost incentive.  Shared mediums in general
are subject to oversubscribing, such that the number of users a network
can support is either accurate on an underutilized network or may
assume an average bandwidth or other usage metric that fails to be
accurate during utilization spikes.  Individual metrics are also
affected by in-home devices from cheap routers to microwaves and by
(multi-)user behaviors during tests.  Thus, a single metric alone or a
single reading without context may not be useful in assisting a user
or operator to determine where the problem source actually is.</t>
          <t>User comprehension of a network remains a challenging problem.
Multiple workshop participants argued for a single number (potentially
calculated with a weighted aggregation formula) or a small number of
measurements per expected usage (e.g., a "gaming" score vs. a "content
producer" score).  Many agreed that some users may instead prefer to
consume simplified or color-coded ratings (e.g., good/better/best,
red/yellow/green, or bronze/gold/platinum).</t>

	  <li>Bandwidth is necessary but not alone sufficient.</li>
          <li>In many cases, Internet users don't need more bandwidth but rather
need "better bandwidth", i.e., they need other improvements to
their connectivity.</li>
          <li>We need both active and passive measurements -- passive measurements
can provide historical debugging.</li>
          <li>We need passive measurements to be continuous, archivable, and
queriable, including reliability/connectivity measurements.</li>
          <li>A really meaningful metric for users is whether their application
will work properly or fail because of a lack of a network with
sufficient characteristics.</li>
          <li>A useful metric for goodness must actually incentivize goodness --
good metrics should be actionable to help drive industries towards
improvement.</li>
          <li>A lower-latency Internet, however achieved, would benefit all end
