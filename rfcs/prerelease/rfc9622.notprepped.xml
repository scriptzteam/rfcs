    <abstract>
<t>This document describes an abstract Application Programming Interface (API) to the transport
layer that enables the selection of transport protocols and
network paths dynamically at runtime. This API enables faster deployment
of new protocols and protocol features without requiring changes to the
applications. The specified API follows the Transport Services Architecture
by providing asynchronous, atomic transmission of Messages. It is intended to replace the
BSD Socket API as the common interface to the
transport layer, in an environment where endpoints could select from
multiple network paths and potential transport protocols.</t>

<section anchor="introduction">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document specifies an abstract Application Programming Interface (API) that describes the interface component of
the high-level Transport Services Architecture defined in
<xref target="RFC9621"/>. A Transport Services System supports
asynchronous, atomic transmission of Messages over transport protocols and
network paths dynamically selected at runtime, in environments where an endpoint
selects from multiple network paths and potential transport protocols.</t>
      <t>Applications that adopt this API will benefit from a wide set of
transport features that can evolve over time. This protocol-independent API ensures that the system
providing the API can optimize its behavior based on the application
requirements and network conditions, without requiring changes to the
applications.  This flexibility enables faster deployment of new features and
protocols and can support applications by offering racing and fallback
mechanisms, which otherwise need to be separately implemented in each application.
Transport Services Implementations are free to take any desired form as long
as the API specification in this document is honored; a non-prescriptive guide to
implementing a Transport Services System is available (see <xref target="RFC9623"/>).</t>
      <t>The Transport Services System derives specific path and Protocol Selection
Properties and supported transport features from the analysis provided in
<xref target="RFC8095"/>, <xref target="RFC8923"/>, and
<xref target="RFC8922"/>. The Transport Services API enables an implementation
to dynamically choose a transport protocol rather
than statically binding applications to a protocol at
compile time. The Transport Services API also provides
applications with a way to override transport selection and instantiate a specific stack,
e.g., to support servers wishing to listen to a specific protocol. However, forcing a
choice to use a specific Protocol Stack is discouraged for general use because it can reduce portability.</t>
      <section anchor="notation">
        <name>Terminology and Notation</name>
        <t>The Transport Services API is described in terms of:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Objects with which an application can interact;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Actions the application can perform on these objects;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Events, which an object can send to an application to be processed asynchronously; and</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Parameters associated with these actions and events.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The following notations, which can be combined, are used in this document:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">

            <li><t>An action that creates an object:</t></li>
        </ul>        
        <artwork><![CDATA[
      Object := Action()
]]></artwork>

        <ul spacing="normal">
            <li><t>An action that creates an array of objects:</t></li>
	</ul>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
      []Object := Action()
]]></artwork>

        <ul spacing="normal">
            <li><t>An action that is performed on an object:</t></li>
	</ul>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
      Object.Action()
]]></artwork>

        <ul spacing="normal">       
            <li><t>An object sends an event:</t></li>
	</ul>

        <artwork><![CDATA[
      Object -> Event<>
]]></artwork>

        <ul spacing="normal">
            <li><t>An action takes a set of parameters; an event contains a set of parameters.
Action and event parameters whose names are suffixed with a question mark are optional:</t></li>
	</ul>

       <artwork><![CDATA[
      Action(param0, param1?, ...)
      Event<param0, param1?, ...>
]]></artwork>
       
        <t>Objects that are passed as parameters to actions use call-by-value behavior.
Actions not associated with an object are actions on the API; they are equivalent to actions on a per-application global context.</t>
        <t>Events are sent to the application or application-supplied code (e.g., Framers;
see <xref target="framing"/>) for processing; the details of event interfaces are specific to the platform or
implementation and can be implemented using
other forms of asynchronous processing, as idiomatic for the
implementing platform.</t>
        <t>We also make use of the following basic types:</t>
        <dl spacing="normal">
 
            <dt>Boolean:</dt><dd> Instances take the value <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>Integer:</dt><dd> Instances take integer values.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>Numeric:</dt><dd> Instances take real number values.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>String:</dt><dd> Instances are represented in UTF-8.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>IP Address:</dt><dd> An IPv4 address <xref target="RFC791"/> or IPv6 address <xref target="RFC4291"/>.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>Enumeration:</dt><dd> A family of types in which each instance takes one of a fixed,
predefined set of values specific to a given enumerated type.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>Tuple:</dt><dd> An ordered grouping of multiple value types, represented as a
comma-separated list in parentheses, e.g., <tt>(Enumeration, Preference)</tt>.
Instances take a sequence of values, each valid for the corresponding value
type.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>Array:</dt><dd> Denoted <tt>[]Type</tt>, an instance takes a value for each of zero or more
elements in a sequence of the given Type. An array can be of fixed or
variable length.</dd>
          
          
            <dt>Set:</dt><dd> An unordered grouping of one or more different values of the same type.</dd>

      <name>Overview of the API Design</name>
      <t>The design of the API specified in this document is based on a set of
principles, themselves an elaboration on the architectural design principles
defined in <xref target="RFC9621"/>. The API defined in this document
provides:</t>
<ul spacing="normal">

  
        <li>
          <t>A Transport Services System that
can offer a variety of transport protocols, independent
of the Protocol Stacks that will be used at
runtime. To the degree possible, all common features of these Protocol
Stacks are made available to the application in a
transport-independent way.
This enables applications written for a single API
to make use of transport protocols in terms of the features
they provide.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>A unified API to datagram and stream-oriented transports, allowing
the use of a common API for Connection establishment and closing.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Message-orientation, as opposed to stream-orientation, using
    application-assisted framing and deframing where the underlying
    transport does not itself provide the required framing.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Asynchronous Connection establishment, transmission, and reception.
This allows concurrent operations during establishment and event-driven
application interactions with the transport layer.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Selection between alternate network paths, using additional information about the
networks over which a Connection can operate (e.g., Provisioning Domain (PvD)
information <xref target="RFC7556"/>) where available.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Explicit support for transport-specific features to be applied, when that
particular transport is part of a chosen Protocol Stack.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Explicit support for security properties as first-order transport features.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Explicit support for configuration of cryptographic identities and transport
Security Parameters persistent across multiple Connections.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Explicit support for multistreaming and multipath transport protocols, and
the grouping of related Connections into Connection Groups through "cloning"
of Connections (see <xref target="groups"/>). This function allows applications to take full advantage of new
transport protocols supporting these features.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section anchor="api-summary">
      <name>API Summary</name>
      <t>An application primarily interacts with this API through two objects:
Preconnections and Connections. A Preconnection object (<xref target="pre-establishment"/>)
represents a set of Properties and constraints on the selection and configuration of
paths and protocols to establish a Connection with an Endpoint. A Connection object
represents an instance of a transport Protocol Stack on which data can be sent to and/or
received from a Remote Endpoint (i.e., a logical connection that, depending on the
kind of transport, can be bidirectional or unidirectional, and that can use a stream
protocol or a datagram protocol). Connections are presented consistently to the
application, irrespective of whether the underlying transport is connectionless or
connection oriented. Connections can be created from Preconnections in three ways:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>initiating the Preconnection (i.e., creating a Connection from the Preconnection, actively opening, as in a client; see <tt>Initiate</tt> in <xref target="initiate"/>),</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>listening on the Preconnection (i.e., creating a Listener based on the Preconnection, passively opening, as in a server; see <tt>Listen</tt> in <xref target="listen"/>), or</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>a rendezvous for the Preconnection (i.e., peer-to-peer Connection establishment; see <tt>Rendezvous</tt> in <xref target="rendezvous"/>).</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>Once a Connection is established, data can be sent and received on it in the form of
Messages. The API supports the preservation of Message boundaries via both
explicit Protocol Stack support and application support through a
Message Framer that finds Message boundaries in a stream. Messages are
received asynchronously through event handlers registered by the application.
Errors and other notifications also happen asynchronously on the Connection.
It is not necessary for an application to handle all events; some events can
have implementation-specific default handlers.</t>
      <t>The application <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>
assume that ignoring events (e.g., errors) is always safe.</t>
      <section anchor="usage-examples">
        <name>Usage Examples</name>
        <t>The following usage examples illustrate how an application might use the
Transport Services API to act as:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>a server, by listening for incoming Connections, receiving requests,
and sending responses; see <xref target="server-example"/>.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>a client, by connecting to a Remote Endpoint using <tt>Initiate</tt>, sending
requests, and receiving responses; see <xref target="client-example"/>.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>a peer, by connecting to a Remote Endpoint using <tt>Rendezvous</tt> while
simultaneously waiting for incoming Connections, sending Messages, and
receiving Messages; see <xref target="peer-example"/>.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The examples in this section presume that a transport protocol is available
between the Local and Remote Endpoints and that this protocol provides reliable data transfer, preservation of
data ordering, and preservation of Message boundaries. In this case, the
application can choose to receive only complete Messages.</t>
        <t>If none of the available transport protocols provide preservation of Message
boundaries, but there is a transport protocol that provides a reliable ordered
byte-stream, an application could receive this byte-stream as partial
Messages and transform it into application-layer Messages.  Alternatively,
an application might provide a Message Framer, which can transform a
sequence of Messages into a byte-stream and vice versa (<xref target="framing"/>).</t>

          <t>This is an example of how an application might open two Connections
   to a remote application using the Transport Services API, send a
   request, and receive a response for each of the two Connections.
The code designated with comments as "Ready event handler" could, for example, be implemented
as a callback function. This function would receive the Connection that it expects

          <t>A Preconnection serves as a template for creating a Connection via initiating, listening, or via rendezvous. Once a Connection has been created,
changes made to the Preconnection that was used to create it do not affect this Connection. Preconnections are reusable after being used to create a Connection, whether or not this Connection was closed. Hence, in the above example, it would be correct for the client to initiate a third Connection to the <tt>example.com</tt> server by continuing as follows:</t>

      <name>Transport Properties</name>
      <t>Each application using the Transport Services API declares its preferences
for how the Transport Services System is to operate. This is done by using
Transport Properties, as defined in <xref target="RFC9621"/>, at each stage
of the lifetime of a Connection.</t>
      <t>Transport Properties are divided into Selection, Connection, and Message
Properties.</t>
      <t>Selection Properties (see <xref target="selection-props"/>) can only be set
during preestablishment. They are only used to specify which paths and
Protocol Stacks can be used and are preferred by the application.
Calling <tt>Initiate</tt> on a Preconnection creates an outbound Connection,
and the Selection Properties remain readable from the
Connection but become immutable. Selection Properties
can be set on Preconnections, and the effect of Selection Properties
can be queried on Connections and Messages.</t>
      <t>Connection Properties (see <xref target="connection-props"/>) are used to inform
decisions made during establishment and to fine-tune the established
Connection. They can be set during preestablishment and can be
changed later. Connection Properties can be set on Connections and
Preconnections; when set on Preconnections, they act as an initial
default for the resulting Connections.</t>
      <t>Message Properties (see <xref target="message-props"/>) control the behavior of the
selected Protocol Stack(s) when sending Messages. Message Properties
can be set on Messages, Connections, and Preconnections; when set on
the latter two, they act as an initial default for the Messages sent
over those Connections.</t>
      <t>Note that configuring Connection Properties and Message Properties on
Preconnections is preferred over setting them later. Early specification of
Connection Properties allows their use as additional input to the selection
process. Protocol-specific Properties, which enable configuration of specialized
features of a specific protocol (see <xref section="3.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9621"/>), are not
used as input to the selection process; they only support configuration if
the respective protocol has been selected.</t>
      <section anchor="property-names">
        <name>Transport Property Names</name>
        <t>Transport Properties are referred to by names, represented as case-insensitive strings. These names serve two purposes:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Allowing different components of a Transport Services
   Implementation to pass Transport Properties (e.g., between a

   Services Implementation to represent Properties retrieved from
   a file or other storage to the application.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Making the code of different Transport Services Implementations
   look similar.  While individual programming languages might
   preclude strict adherence to the naming convention of representing
   Property names as case-insensitive strings
   (for instance, by prohibiting the use of hyphens in symbols),
   users interacting with multiple implementations will still benefit
   from the consistency resulting from the use of visually similar
   symbols.</t>
          </li>


        </ul>
        <t>Transport Property names are hierarchically organized in the

generic Properties, i.e., for Properties that are not specific to a protocol.
</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Protocol-specific Properties <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the protocol acronym as the Namespace (e.g., a
Connection that uses TCP could support a TCP-specific Transport Property, such as the TCP User Timeout
value, in a Protocol-specific Property called <tt>tcp.userTimeoutValue</tt> (see <xref target="tcp-uto"/>)).</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Vendor-specific or implementation-specific Properties <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be placed in a Namespace starting with the underscore character ("<tt>_</tt>") 
 and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use a string identifying the vendor or implementation.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
	    
	    
            <t>For IETF protocols, the name of a Protocol-specific Property <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be specified in an RFC from the IETF Stream (after IETF Review <xref target="RFC8126"/>).  An IETF protocol Namespace does not start with an underscore character ("<tt>_</tt>").</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Namespaces for each of the keywords provided in the "Protocol Numbers" registry
(see <eref brackets="angle" target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/"/>) are reserved
for Protocol-specific Properties and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used for vendor-specific or implementation-specific Properties.
Terms listed as keywords, as in the "Protocol Numbers" registry, <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be avoided as any part of a vendor-specific or
implementation-specific Property name.</t>
        <t>Though Transport Property names are case insensitive, it is recommended to use camelCase to improve readability.
Implementations may transpose Transport Property names into snake_case or PascalCase to blend into the language environment.</t>

      <name>Scope of the API Definition</name>
      <t>This document defines a language- and platform-independent API of a
Transport Services System. Given the wide variety of languages and language
conventions used to write applications that use the transport layer to connect
to other applications over the Internet, this independence makes this API
necessarily abstract.</t>
      <t>There is no interoperability benefit in tightly defining how the API is
presented to application programmers across diverse platforms. However,
maintaining the "shape" of the abstract API across different platforms reduces
the effort for programmers who learn to use the Transport Services API to then
apply their knowledge to another platform. That said, implementations have
significant freedom in presenting this API to programmers, balancing the
conventions of the protocol with the shape of the API. We make the following
recommendations:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Actions, events, and errors in implementations of the Transport Services API <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use
the names assigned to them in this document, subject to capitalization,
punctuation, and other typographic conventions in the language of the
implementation, unless the implementation itself uses different names for
substantially equivalent objects for networking by convention.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Transport Services Systems <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> implement each Selection Property,
Connection Property, and MessageContext Property specified in this document.
These features <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be implemented even when, in a specific implementation, it
will always result in no operation, e.g., there is no action when the API
specifies a Property that is not available in a transport protocol implemented
on a specific platform. For example, if TCP is the only underlying transport protocol,
the Message Property <tt>msgOrdered</tt> can be implemented (trivially, as a no-op) as
disabling the requirement for ordering will not have any effect on delivery order
for Connections over TCP. Similarly, the <tt>msgLifetime</tt> Message Property can be
implemented but ignored, as the description of this Property (<xref target="msg-lifetime"/>) states that "it is not
guaranteed that a Message will not be sent when its Lifetime has expired".</t>
<!-- Above-quoted text is DNE text from Section 9.1.3.1 -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Implementations can use other representations for Transport Property names,
e.g., by providing constants, but should provide a straightforward mapping
between their representation and the Property names specified here.</t>

      <name>Preestablishment Phase</name>
      <t>The preestablishment phase allows applications to specify Properties for
the Connections that they are about to make or to query the API about potential
Connections they could make.</t>
      <t>A Preconnection object represents a potential Connection. It is a passive object
(a data structure) that merely maintains the state that
describes the Properties of a Connection that might exist in the future.  This state
comprises Local Endpoint and Remote Endpoint objects that denote the Endpoints
of the potential Connection (see <xref target="endpointspec"/>), the Selection Properties

the Preconnection is used to <tt>Initiate</tt>
connections. If no Local Endpoint is specified, the Transport Services System will
assign an ephemeral local port to the Connection on the appropriate interface(s).
At least one Remote Endpoint <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be specified if the Preconnection is used
to <tt>Initiate</tt> Connections, but the list of Remote Endpoints <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be empty if
the Preconnection is used to <tt>Listen</tt> for incoming Connections.
At least one Local Endpoint and one Remote Endpoint <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be specified if a
peer-to-peer <tt>Rendezvous</tt> is to occur based on the Preconnection.</t>
      <t>If more than one Local Endpoint is specified on a Preconnection, then the application
 is indicating that all of the Local Endpoints are eligible to be used for Connections. For
 example, their Endpoint Identifiers might correspond to different interfaces on a multihomed
host or their Endpoint Identifiers might correspond to local interfaces and a STUN server that
can be resolved to a server-reflexive address for a Preconnection used to
make a peer-to-peer <tt>Rendezvous</tt>.</t>
      <t>If more than one Remote Endpoint is specified on the Preconnection, the
application is indicating that it expects all of the Remote Endpoints to
offer an equivalent service and that the Transport Services System can choose
any of them for a Connection.
For example, a Remote Endpoint might represent various network
interfaces of a host, or a server-reflexive address that can be used to
reach a host, or a set of hosts that provide equivalent local balanced
service.</t>
      <t>In most cases, it is expected that a single Remote Endpoint will be
specified by name, and a later call to <tt>Initiate</tt> on the Preconnection
(see <xref target="initiate"/>) will internally resolve that name to a list of concrete
Endpoint Identifiers. Specifying multiple Remote Endpoints on a Preconnection allows
applications to override this for more detailed control.</t>

        <name>Specifying Endpoints</name>

behavior.</t>
        <t>The design of the API <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> permit an Endpoint object to be configured with multiple Endpoint Identifiers of the same type.
For example, an Endpoint object cannot specify two IP addresses. Two separate IP addresses
are represented as two Endpoint objects. If a Preconnection specifies a Remote
Endpoint with a specific IP address set, it will only establish Connections to
that IP address. If, on the other hand, a Remote Endpoint specifies a hostname
but no addresses, the Transport Services Implementation can perform name resolution and attempt
using any address derived from the original hostname of the Remote Endpoint.
Note that multiple Remote Endpoints can be added to a Preconnection, as discussed
in <xref target="add-endpoints"/>.</t>
        <t>The Transport Services System resolves names internally, when the <tt>Initiate</tt>,
<tt>Listen</tt>, or <tt>Rendezvous</tt> action is called to establish a Connection. Privacy
considerations for the timing of this resolution are given in <xref target="privacy-security"/>.</t>
        <t>The <tt>Resolve</tt> action on a Preconnection can be used by the application to force
early binding when required, for example, with some Network Address Translator
(NAT) traversal protocols (see <xref target="rendezvous"/>).</t>
        <section anchor="using-multicast-endpoints">
          <name>Using Multicast Endpoints</name>
          <t>To use multicast, a Preconnection is first created with the Local or Remote Endpoint Identifier
specifying the Any-Source Multicast (ASM) or Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) group and destination port number.
This is then followed by a call to either <tt>Initiate</tt>, <tt>Listen</tt>, or
<tt>Rendezvous</tt>, depending on whether the resulting Connection is to be
used to send Messages to the multicast group, receive Messages from
the group, or both send and
receive Messages (as is the case for an ASM group).</t>
          <t>Note that the Transport Services API has separate specifier calls for multicast groups to avoid introducing filter Properties for single-source multicast and seeks to avoid confusion that can be caused by overloading the unicast specifiers.</t>
          <t>Calling <tt>Initiate</tt> on that Preconnection creates a Connection that can be
used to send Messages to the multicast group. The Connection object that is
created will support <tt>Send</tt> but not <tt>Receive</tt>. Any Connections created this
way are send-only and do not join the multicast group. The resulting
Connection will have a Local Endpoint identifying the local interface to
which the Connection is bound and a Remote Endpoint identifying the
multicast group.</t>
          <t>The following API calls can be used to configure a Preconnection before calling <tt>Initiate</tt>:</t>
          <artwork><![CDATA[

          <t>Calling <tt>Listen</tt> on a Preconnection with a multicast group address specified as the Remote
Endpoint Identifier will trigger the Transport Services Implementation to join the multicast group to receive Messages. This Listener
will create one Connection for each Remote Endpoint sending to the group,
with the Local Endpoint Identifier specified as a group address. The set of Connection
objects created forms a Connection Group.
The receiving interface can be restricted by passing it as part of the LocalSpecifier or queried through the MessageContext on the Messages received (see <xref target="msg-ctx"/> for further details).</t>
          <t>Specifying <tt>WithHopLimit</tt> sets the Time To Live (TTL) field in the header of IPv4 packets or the Hop Count field in the header of IPv6 packets.</t>

        <name>Specifying Transport Properties</name>
	
        <t>A Preconnection object holds Properties reflecting the application's
requirements and preferences for the transport. These include Selection
Properties for selecting Protocol Stacks and paths, as well as Connection
Properties and Message Properties for configuration of the detailed operation
of the selected Protocol Stacks on a per-Connection and per-Message level.</t>
        <t>The protocol(s) and path(s) selected as candidates during establishment are
determined and configured using these Properties. Since there could be paths
over which some transport protocols are unable to operate, or Remote Endpoints
that support only specific network addresses or transports, transport protocol
selection is necessarily tied to path selection. This could involve choosing
between multiple local interfaces that are connected to different access
networks.</t>
        <t>When additional information (such as PvD information
<xref target="RFC7556"/>) is available about the networks over which an Endpoint can operate,
this can inform the selection between alternate network paths.
Path information can include the Path MTU (PMTU), the set of supported Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs),
expected usage, cost, etc. The usage of this information by the Transport
Services System is generally independent of the specific mechanism or protocol
used to receive the information (e.g., zero-conf, DHCP, or IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs)).</t>
        <t>Most Selection Properties are represented as Preferences, which can
take one of five values:</t>
        <table anchor="tab-pref-levels">
          <name>Selection Property Preference Levels</name>
          <thead>
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td align="left">Require</td>
              <td align="left">Select only protocols/paths providing the Property; otherwise, fail</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td align="left">Prefer</td>
              <td align="left">Prefer protocols/paths providing the Property; otherwise, proceed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td align="left">No Preference</td>
              <td align="left">No preference</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td align="left">Avoid</td>
              <td align="left">Prefer protocols/paths not providing the Property; otherwise, proceed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td align="left">Prohibit</td>
              <td align="left">Select only protocols/paths not providing the Property; otherwise, fail</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <t>The implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure an outcome that is consistent with all application
requirements expressed using <tt>Require</tt> and <tt>Prohibit</tt>. While preferences
expressed using <tt>Prefer</tt> and <tt>Avoid</tt> influence protocol and path selection as well,
outcomes can vary, even given the same Selection Properties, because the available
protocols and paths can differ across systems and contexts. However,
implementations are <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to seek to provide a consistent outcome
to an application, when provided with the same set of Selection Properties.</t>
        <t>Note that application preferences can conflict with each other. For
example, if an application indicates a preference for a specific path by
specifying an interface, but also a preference for a protocol, a situation
might occur in which the preferred protocol is not available on the preferred
path. In such cases, applications can expect Properties that determine path
selection to be prioritized over Properties that determine protocol selection.
The Transport Services System <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> determine the preferred path first, regardless of
protocol preferences. This ordering is chosen to provide consistency across
implementations; this is based on the fact that it is more common for the use of a
given network path to determine cost to the user (i.e., an interface type
preference might be based on a user's preference to avoid being charged
more for a cellular data plan).</t>
        <t>Selection and Connection Properties, as well as defaults for Message
Properties, can be added to a Preconnection to configure the selection process
and to further configure the eventually selected Protocol Stack(s). They are
collected into a TransportProperties object to be passed into a Preconnection
object:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
TransportProperties := NewTransportProperties()
]]></artwork>
        <t>Individual Properties are then set on the TransportProperties object.
Setting a Transport Property to a value overrides the previous value of this Transport Property.</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
TransportProperties.Set(property, value)
]]></artwork>
        <t>To aid readability, implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide additional convenience functions to simplify the use of Selection Properties: see <xref target="preference-conv"/> for examples.
In addition, implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide a mechanism to create TransportProperties objects that
are preconfigured for common use cases, as outlined in <xref target="property-profiles"/>.</t>
        <t>Transport Properties for an established Connection can be queried via the Connection object, as outlined in <xref target="introspection"/>.</t>
        <t>A Connection gets its Transport Properties by either being explicitly configured
via a Preconnection, being configured after establishment, or inheriting them
from an antecedent via cloning; see <xref target="groups"/> for more details.</t>
        <t><xref target="connection-props"/> provides a list of Connection Properties, while Selection
Properties are listed in the subsections below. Selection Properties are
only considered during establishment and cannot be changed after a Connection
is established. At this point, Selection Properties can only
be read to check the Properties used by the Connection. Upon reading, the
	Preference type of a Selection Property changes into Boolean, where:</t>
	<ul><li><tt>true</tt> means
that the selected Protocol Stack supports the feature or uses the path associated
with the Selection Property, and</li>
<li><tt>false</tt> means that the Protocol Stack does not
	support the feature or use the path.</li></ul>
	<t>Implementations
of Transport Services Systems could alternatively use the <tt>Require</tt>
and <tt>Prohibit</tt> Preference values to represent <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>, respectively.
Other types of Selection Properties remain unchanged when they are made available for
reading after a Connection is established.</t>
        <t>An implementation of the Transport Services API needs to provide sensible defaults for Selection
Properties. The default values for each Property below represent a
configuration that can be implemented over TCP. If these default values are used
and TCP is not supported by a Transport Services System, then an application using the
default set of Properties might not succeed in establishing a Connection. Using
the same default values for independent Transport Services Systems can be beneficial
when applications are ported between different implementations/platforms, even if this
default could lead to a Connection failure when TCP is not available. If default
values other than those suggested below are used, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to clearly
document any differences.</t>

selection to that single interface, and often leads to less flexible and resilient
Connection establishment.</t>
          <t>In contrast to other Selection Properties, this Property is a set of
tuples of (enumerated) interface identifier and Preference. It can either be
implemented directly as such or be implemented to
make one Preference available for each interface and interface type
available on the system.

</t>
          <t>The set of valid interface types is specific to the implementation or system. For
example, on a mobile device, there could be <tt>Wi-Fi</tt> and <tt>Cellular</tt> interface types
available; whereas, on a desktop computer, <tt>Wi-Fi</tt> and <tt>Wired
Ethernet</tt> interface types might be available. An implementation should provide all types
that are supported on the local system to allow
applications to be written generically. For example, if a single implementation
is used on both mobile devices and desktop devices, it ought to define the
<tt>Cellular</tt> interface type for both systems, since an application might wish to

          <t>Similar to <tt>interface</tt> (see <xref target="prop-interface"/>), this Property
allows the application to control path selection by selecting which specific
PvD or categories of PvDs it wants to
<tt>Require</tt>, <tt>Prohibit</tt>, <tt>Prefer</tt>, or <tt>Avoid</tt>. Provisioning Domains define
consistent sets of network properties that might be more specific than network
interfaces <xref target="RFC7556"/>.</t>
          <t>As with <tt>interface</tt>, this Property is a set of tuples of (enumerated)
PvD identifier and Preference. It can either be implemented directly as such or be implemented to
make one Preference available for each interface and interface type
available on the system.</t>
          <t>The identification of a specific PvD is specific to the implementation or system.
<xref target="RFC8801"/> defines how to use an FQDN to identify a PvD when advertised by
a network, but systems might also use other locally relevant identifiers
such as string names or Integers to identify PvDs. As with requiring specific
interfaces, requiring a specific PvD strictly limits the path selection.</t>
          <t>Categories or types of PvDs are also defined to be specific to the implementation or system. These can be useful to identify a service that is provided by a
PvD. For example, if an application wants to use a PvD that provides a
Voice-Over-IP (VoIP) service on a Cellular network, it can use the relevant PvD type to
require a PvD that provides this service, without needing to look up a
particular instance. While this does restrict path selection, it is broader than
requiring specific PvD instances or interface instances and should be preferred
over these options.</t>

          <t>This Property allows the application to express a preference for the use of
temporary local addresses, sometimes called "privacy" addresses <xref target="RFC8981"/>.
Temporary addresses are generally used to prevent linking connections over time
when a stable address, sometimes called a "permanent" address, is not needed.
There are some caveats to note when specifying this Property. First, if an
application requires the use of temporary addresses, the resulting Connection
cannot use IPv4 because temporary addresses do not exist in IPv4. Second,
temporary local addresses might involve trading off privacy for performance.
For instance, temporary addresses (e.g., <xref target="RFC8981"/>) can interfere with resumption mechanisms
that some protocols rely on to reduce initial latency.</t>

          <t>This Property specifies whether, and how, applications want to take advantage of
transferring data across multiple paths between the same end hosts.
Using multiple paths allows Connections to migrate between interfaces or aggregate bandwidth
as availability and performance properties change.
Possible values are as follows:</t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Disabled:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>The Connection will not use multiple paths once established, even if the chosen transport supports using multiple paths.</t>

            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>The policy for using multiple paths is specified using the separate <tt>multipathPolicy</tt> Property; see <xref target="multipath-policy"/>.
To enable the peer Endpoint to initiate additional paths toward a local address other than the one initially used, it is necessary to set the <tt>advertisesAltaddr</tt> Property (see <xref target="altaddr"/>).</t>
          <t>Setting this Property to <tt>Active</tt> can have privacy implications.  It enables the transport to establish connectivity using alternate paths that might result in users being linkable across the multiple paths, even if the <tt>advertisesAltaddr</tt> Property (see <xref target="altaddr"/>) is set to <tt>false</tt>.</t>
          <t>Note that this Property has no corresponding Selection Property of type "Preference".
Enumeration values other than <tt>Disabled</tt> are interpreted as a preference for choosing protocols that can make use of multiple paths.
The <tt>Disabled</tt> value implies a requirement not to use multiple paths in parallel but does not prevent choosing a protocol that is capable of using multiple paths, e.g., it does not prevent choosing TCP but prevents sending the <tt>MP_CAPABLE</tt> option in the TCP handshake.</t>

          <t>The most common client-server communication pattern involves the
client actively opening a Connection, then sending data to the server. The
server listens (passive open), reads, and then answers. This Property
	  specifies whether an application wants to diverge from this pattern by either:</t>
	  <ol><li>actively opening with <tt>Initiate</tt>, immediately followed by reading or</li>
	  <li>passively opening with <tt>Listen</tt>,
	  immediately followed by writing.</li>

	<t>This Property is ignored when establishing
connections using <tt>Rendezvous</tt>.
Requiring this Property limits the choice of mappings to underlying protocols,
which can reduce
efficiency. For example, it prevents the Transport Services System from mapping
Connections to Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) streams, where
the first transmitted data takes the role of an active open signal.</t>

        <name>Specifying Security Parameters and Callbacks</name>
        <t>Most Security Parameters, e.g., TLS ciphersuites, local identity and private key, etc.,
can be configured statically. Others are dynamically configured during Connection establishment.
Security Parameters and callbacks are partitioned based on their place in the lifetime
of Connection establishment. Similar to Transport Properties, both parameters and callbacks
are inherited during cloning (see <xref target="groups"/>).</t>
        <t>This document specifies an abstract API, which could appear to conflict with the need
for Security Parameters to be unambiguous. The Transport Services System <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide reasonable,
secure defaults for each enumerated Security Parameter, such that users of the system
only need to specify parameters required to establish a secure connection
(e.g., <tt>serverCertificate</tt> or <tt>clientCertificate</tt>). Specifying Security Parameters
from enumerated values (e.g., specific ciphersuites) might constrain which transport
protocols can be selected during Connection establishment.</t>
        <t>Security Parameters are specified in the preestablishment phase
and are created as follows:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
]]></artwork>
        <t>Specific parameters are added using a call to <tt>Set</tt> on the <tt>SecurityParameters</tt>.</t>
        <t>As with the rest of the Transport Services API, the exact names of parameters and/or
values of Enumerations (e.g., ciphersuites) used in the Security Parameters are specific to the system or
implementation and ought to be chosen to follow the principle of least
surprise for users of the platform/language environment in question.</t>
        <t>For Security Parameters that are Enumerations of known values, such as TLS
ciphersuites, implementations are responsible for exposing the set of values
they support. For Security Parameters that are not simple value types, such
as certificates and keys, implementations are responsible for exposing
types appropriate for the platform/language environment.</t>
        <t>Applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use common safe defaults for values such as TLS ciphersuites
whenever possible. However, as discussed in <xref target="RFC8922"/>, many transport security protocols
require specific Security Parameters and constraints from the client at the time of
configuration and actively during a handshake.</t>
        <t>The set of Security Parameters defined here is not exhaustive, but illustrative.
Implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> expose an equivalent to the parameters listed below to allow for
sufficient configuration of Security Parameters, but the details are expected
to vary based on platform and implementation constraints. Applications <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able
to constrain the security protocols and versions that the Transport Services System
will use.</t>
        <t>Representation of Security Parameters in implementations ought to parallel
that chosen for Transport Property names as suggested in <xref target="scope-of-interface-defn"/>.</t>
        <t>Connections that use Transport Services <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use security in general. However, for
compatibility with endpoints that do not support transport security protocols (such
as a TCP endpoint that does not support TLS), applications can initialize their
Security Parameters to indicate that security can be disabled or opportunistic.
If security is disabled, the Transport Services System will not attempt to add
transport security automatically. If security is opportunistic, it will allow
Connections without transport security, but it will still attempt to use unauthenticated
security if available.</t>

      <name>Establishing Connections</name>
      <t>Before a Connection can be used for data transfer, it needs to be established.
Establishment ends the preestablishment phase; all transport Properties and
cryptographic parameter specification must be complete before establishment,
as these will be used to select Candidate Paths and Protocol Stacks
for the Connection. Establishment can be active, using the <tt>Initiate</tt> action;
passive, using the <tt>Listen</tt> action; or simultaneous for peer-to-peer connections, using
the <tt>Rendezvous</tt> action. These actions are described in the subsections below.</t>
      <section anchor="initiate">
        <name>Active Open: Initiate</name>
        <t>Active open is the action of establishing a Connection to a Remote Endpoint presumed
to be listening for incoming Connection requests. Active open is used by clients in
client-server interactions. Active open is supported by the Transport Services API through the
<tt>Initiate</tt> action:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Connection := Preconnection.Initiate(timeout?)
]]></artwork>
        <t>The <tt>timeout</tt> parameter specifies how long to wait before aborting active open.
Before calling <tt>Initiate</tt>, the caller must have populated a Preconnection
object with a Remote Endpoint object to identify the Endpoint, optionally a Local Endpoint
object (if not specified, the system will attempt to determine a
suitable Local Endpoint), as well as all Properties
necessary for candidate selection.</t>
        <t>The <tt>Initiate</tt> action returns a Connection object. Once <tt>Initiate</tt> has been
called, any changes to the Preconnection <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have any effect on the
Connection. However, the Preconnection can be reused, e.g., to <tt>Initiate</tt>
	another Connection.</t>
	
        <t>Once <tt>Initiate</tt> is called, the Candidate Protocol Stack(s) can cause one or more
candidate transport-layer connections to be created to the specified Remote
Endpoint. The caller could immediately begin sending Messages on the Connection
(see <xref target="sending"/>) after calling <tt>Initiate</tt>; note that any data marked as "safely replayable" that is sent
while the Connection is being established could be sent multiple times or using
multiple candidates.</t>
        <t>The following events can be sent by the Connection after <tt>Initiate</tt> is called:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[

        <t>The <tt>Ready</tt> event occurs after <tt>Initiate</tt> has established a transport-layer

        <artwork><![CDATA[

        <t>Before calling <tt>Listen</tt>, the caller must have initialized the Preconnection

        <artwork><![CDATA[
Preconnection.Rendezvous()

along with the Transport Properties and Security Parameters needed for
Protocol Stack selection before the <tt>Rendezvous</tt> action is initiated.</t>
        <t>The <tt>Rendezvous</tt> action listens on the Local Endpoint
candidates for an incoming Connection from the Remote Endpoint candidates,
while also simultaneously trying to establish a Connection from the Local
Endpoint candidates to the Remote Endpoint candidates.</t>
        <t>If there are multiple Local Endpoints or Remote Endpoints configured, then
initiating a <tt>Rendezvous</tt> action will cause the Transport Services
Implementation to systematically probe the reachability
of those endpoint candidates following an approach such as that used in
Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref target="RFC8445"/>.</t>
        <t>If the endpoints are suspected to be behind a NAT, and the Local Endpoint
supports a method of discovering NAT bindings, such as STUN <xref target="RFC8489"/> or Traversal Using Relays around NAT
(TURN) <xref target="RFC8656"/>, then the <tt>Resolve</tt> action on the Preconnection can be
used to discover such bindings:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
[]LocalEndpoint, []RemoteEndpoint := Preconnection.Resolve()

        <t>The <tt>Resolve</tt> action returns lists of Local Endpoints and Remote Endpoints
that represent the concrete addresses, local and server reflexive, on which
a <tt>Rendezvous</tt> for the Preconnection will listen for incoming Connections
and to which it will attempt to establish Connections.</t>
        <t>Note that the set of Local Endpoints returned by <tt>Resolve</tt> might or might not
contain information about all possible local interfaces, depending on how the
Preconnection is configured. The set of available local interfaces can also
change over time, so care needs to be taken when using stored interface names.</t>
        <t>An application that uses <tt>Rendezvous</tt> to establish a peer-to-peer Connection
in the presence of NATs will configure the Preconnection object with at least
one Local Endpoint that supports NAT binding discovery. It will then <tt>Resolve</tt>
the Preconnection and pass the resulting list of Local Endpoint candidates to
the peer via a signaling protocol, for example, as part of an ICE exchange <xref target="RFC8445"/>
within SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/> or WebRTC <xref target="RFC7478"/>.  The peer will then,
via the same signaling channel, return the Remote Endpoint candidates.
The set of Remote Endpoint candidates is then configured on the Preconnection:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Preconnection.AddRemote([]RemoteEndpoint)
]]></artwork>
        <t>Once the application has
added both the Local Endpoint candidates and the Remote Endpoint candidates
retrieved from the peer via the signaling channel to the Preconnection,
the <tt>Rendezvous</tt> action is initiated and causes the Transport Services
Implementation to begin connectivity checks.</t>
        <t>If successful, the <tt>Rendezvous</tt> action returns a Connection object via a
<tt>RendezvousDone</tt> event:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Preconnection -> RendezvousDone<Connection>
]]></artwork>
        <t>The <tt>RendezvousDone</tt> event occurs when a Connection is established with the
Remote Endpoint. For connection-oriented transports, this occurs when the
transport-layer connection is established; for connectionless transports,
it occurs when the first Message is received from the Remote Endpoint. The
resulting Connection is contained within the <tt>RendezvousDone</tt> event and is
ready to use as soon as it is passed to the application via the event.
Changes made to a Preconnection after <tt>Rendezvous</tt> has been called <bcp14>MUST

        <name>Connection Groups</name>
        <t>Connection Groups can be created using the <tt>Clone</tt> action:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Connection := Connection.Clone(framer?, connectionProperties?)
]]></artwork>
        <t>Calling <tt>Clone</tt> on a Connection yields a Connection Group containing two Connections: the parent
Connection on which <tt>Clone</tt> was called and a resulting cloned Connection.
The new Connection is actively opened, and it will locally send a <tt>Ready</tt> event or an <tt>EstablishmentError</tt> event.
Calling <tt>Clone</tt> on any of these Connections adds another Connection to
the Connection Group. Connections in a Connection Group share all
Connection Properties except <tt>connPriority</tt> (see <xref target="conn-priority"/>),
and these Connection Properties are entangled: changing one of the
Connection Properties on one Connection in the Connection Group
automatically changes the Connection Property for all others. For example, changing
<tt>connTimeout</tt> (see
<xref target="conn-timeout"/>) on one Connection in a Connection Group will automatically
make the same change to this Connection Property for all other Connections in the Connection Group.
Like all other Properties, <tt>connPriority</tt> is copied
to the new Connection when calling <tt>Clone</tt>, but, in this case, a later change to the
<tt>connPriority</tt> on one Connection does not change it on the
other Connections in the same Connection Group.</t>
        <t>The optional <tt>connectionProperties</tt> parameter allows passing
Transport Properties that control the behavior of the underlying stream or connection to be created, e.g., Protocol-specific Properties to request specific stream IDs for SCTP or QUIC.</t>
        <t>Message Properties set on a Connection also apply only to that Connection.</t>
        <t>A new Connection created by <tt>Clone</tt> can have a Message Framer assigned via the optional
<tt>framer</tt> parameter of the <tt>Clone</tt> action. If this parameter is not supplied, the
stack of Message Framers associated with a Connection is copied to
the cloned Connection when calling <tt>Clone</tt>. Then, a cloned Connection
has the same stack of Message Framers as the Connection from which they
are cloned, but these Framers can internally maintain per-Connection state.</t>
        <t>It is also possible to check which Connections belong to the same Connection Group.
Calling <tt>GroupedConnections</tt> on a specific Connection returns a set of all Connections
in the same group.</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
[]Connection := Connection.GroupedConnections()
]]></artwork>
        <t>Connections will belong to the same group if the application previously called <tt>Clone</tt>.
Passive Connections can also be added to the same group, e.g., when a Listener
receives a new Connection that is just a new stream of an already-active multi-streaming
protocol instance.</t>
        <t>If the underlying protocol supports multi-streaming, it is natural to use this
functionality to implement <tt>Clone</tt>. In that case, Connections in a Connection Group are
multiplexed together, giving them similar treatment not only inside Endpoints,
but also across the end-to-end Internet path.</t>
        <t>Note that calling <tt>Clone</tt> can result in on-the-wire signaling, e.g., to open a new
transport connection, depending on the underlying Protocol Stack. When <tt>Clone</tt> leads to
the opening of multiple such connections,
the Transport Services System will ensure consistency of
Connection Properties by uniformly applying them to all underlying connections
in a group. Even in such a case, it is possible for a Transport Services System
to implement prioritization within a Connection Group (see <xref target="TCP-COUPLING"/> and <xref target="RFC8699"/>).</t>
        <t>Attempts to clone a Connection can result in a <tt>CloneError</tt>:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Connection -> CloneError<reason?>
]]></artwork>
        <t>A <tt>CloneError</tt> can also occur later, after <tt>Clone</tt> was successfully called. In this case,
it informs the application that the Connection that sends the <tt>CloneError</tt> is no longer a
part of any Connection Group. For example, this can occur when the Transport Services
system is unable to implement entanglement (a Connection Property was changed on a different
Connection in the Connection Group, but this change could not be successfully applied
to the Connection that sends the <tt>CloneError</tt>).</t>
        <t>The <tt>connPriority</tt> Connection Property operates on Connections in a Connection Group
using the same approach as that used in <xref target="msg-priority"/>: when allocating available network
capacity among Connections in a Connection Group, sends on Connections with
numerically lower priority values will be prioritized over sends on Connections that have
numerically higher priority values. Capacity will be shared among these Connections according to
the <tt>connScheduler</tt> Property (<xref target="conn-scheduler"/>).

        <t>Removing all known Remote Endpoints can have the effect of aborting the

switch to a new path if other reachable Remote Endpoints exist or the
connection might abort.</t>

      <t>Connection Properties represent the configuration and state of the selected
Protocol Stack(s) backing a Connection. These Connection Properties can be

Too much reliance by an application on Protocol-specific Properties can significantly reduce the flexibility

selection and configuration choices. Therefore, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that
Generic Connection Properties be used for properties common across different protocols and that
Protocol-specific Connection Properties are only used where specific protocols or properties are necessary.</t>

Such errors <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> cause the Connection to be terminated.
Note that changing one of the Connection Properties on one Connection in a Connection Group

Message that need to be covered by a checksum.
A receiving Endpoint will not forward Messages that have less coverage
to the application. The application is responsible for handling
any corruption within the non-protected part of the Message <xref target="RFC8085"/>.
A special value of 0 means that a received packet might also have a zero checksum field,
and the enumerated value <tt>Full Coverage</tt> means
that the entire Message needs to be protected by a checksum. An implementation

based on the Maximum Packet Size (MPS). The value of this Property can change over time (and can be updated via Datagram Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD) <xref target="RFC8899"/>).
This value allows a sending stack to avoid unwanted fragmentation at the
network layer or segmentation by the transport layer before
choosing the Message size and/or after a <tt>SendError</tt> occurs indicating
an attempt to send a Message that is too large.  A Transport Services API
could express <tt>Not applicable</tt> in an environment-typical way, e.g., as a Union type or special value (e.g., 0).</t>

          <name>Message Framers</name>
          <t>Although most applications communicate over a network using well-formed
Messages, the boundaries and metadata of the Messages are often not
directly communicated by the transport protocol itself. For example,
HTTP applications send and receive HTTP Messages over a byte-stream
transport, requiring that the boundaries of HTTP Messages be parsed
from the stream of bytes.</t>
          <t>Message Framers allow extending a Connection's Protocol Stack to define
how to encapsulate or encode outbound Messages and how to decapsulate
or decode inbound data into Messages. Message Framers allow Message
boundaries to be preserved when using a Connection object, even when
using byte-stream transports. This is designed based on the fact
that many of the application protocols in use at the time of writing evolved over TCP, which
does not provide Message boundary preservation; because many of these
protocols require Message boundaries to function, each application-layer
protocol has defined its own framing.</t>
          <t>To use a Message Framer, the application adds it to its Preconnection object.
Then, the Message Framer can intercept all calls to <tt>Send</tt> or <tt>Receive</tt>
on a Connection to add Message semantics, in addition to interacting with
the setup and teardown of the Connection. A Framer can start sending data
before the application sends data if the framing protocol requires a prefix
or handshake (see <xref target="RFC9329"/> for an example of such a framing protocol).</t>

          <t>Note that while Message Framers add the most value when placed above
a protocol that otherwise does not preserve Message boundaries, they can
also be used with datagram- or message-based protocols. In these cases,
they add a transformation to further encode or encapsulate
and can potentially support packing multiple application-layer Messages
into individual transport datagrams.</t>
          <t>The API to implement a Message Framer can vary, depending on the implementation;
guidance on implementing Message Framers can be found in <xref target="RFC9623"/>.</t>

            <name>Adding Message Framers to Preconnections</name>
            <t>The Message Framer object can be added to one or more Preconnections
to run on top of transport protocols. Multiple Framers can be added to a Preconnection;
in this case, the Framers operate as a framing stack, i.e., the last one added runs
first when framing outbound Messages, and last when parsing inbound data.</t>
            <t>The following example adds a basic HTTP Message Framer to a Preconnection:</t>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
framer := NewHTTPMessageFramer()
Preconnection.AddFramer(framer)
]]></artwork>
            <t>Since Message Framers pass from Preconnection to Listener or Connection, addition of
Framers must happen before any operation that might result in the creation of a Connection.</t>

          <section anchor="framing-meta">
            <name>Framing Metadata</name>
            <t>When sending Messages, applications can add Framer-specific
Properties to a MessageContext (<xref target="msg-ctx"/>) with the <tt>add</tt> action.
To avoid naming conflicts, the Property
names <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be prefixed with a Namespace referencing the
Framer implementation or the protocol it implements as described
in <xref target="property-names"/>.</t>
            <t>This mechanism can be used, for example, to set the type of a Message for a TLV format.
The Namespace of values is custom for each unique Message Framer.</t>

messageContext := NewMessageContext()

            <t>When an application receives a MessageContext in a <tt>Receive</tt> event,
it can also look to see if a value was set by a specific Message Framer.</t>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
messageContext.get(framer, key) -> value

            <t>For example, if an HTTP Message Framer is used, the values could correspond
to HTTP headers:</t>

        <section anchor="message-props">
          <name>Message Properties</name>
          <t>Applications needing to annotate the Messages they send with extra information
(for example, to control how data is scheduled and processed by the transport protocols supporting the
	  Connection) can include this information in the MessageContext passed to the <tt>Send</tt> action. For other uses of the MessageContext, see <xref target="msg-ctx"/>.</t>
	  
          <t>Message Properties are per-Message, not per-<tt>Send</tt>, if partial Messages
are sent (<xref target="send-partial"/>). All data blocks associated with a single Message
share Properties specified in the MessageContexts. For example, it would not
make sense to have the beginning of a Message expire and then allow the end of the Message to still be sent.</t>
          <t>A MessageContext object contains metadata for the Messages to be sent or received.</t>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
messageData := "hello"
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(parameter, value)
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext)
]]></artwork>
          <t>The simpler form of <tt>Send</tt>, which does not take any MessageContext, is equivalent to passing a default MessageContext without adding any Message Properties.</t>
          <t>If an application wants to override Message Properties for a specific Message,
it can acquire an empty MessageContext object and add all desired Message
Properties to that object. It can then reuse the same MessageContext object
for sending multiple Messages with the same Properties.</t>
          <t>Properties can be added to a MessageContext object only before the context is used
for sending. Once a MessageContext has been used with a <tt>Send</tt> action, further modifications
to the MessageContext object do not have any effect on this <tt>Send</tt> action. Message Properties
that are not added to a MessageContext object before using the context for sending will either
take a specific default value or be configured based on Selection or Connection Properties
of the Connection that is associated with the <tt>Send</tt> action.
This initialization behavior is defined per Message Property below.</t>
          <t>The Message Properties could be inconsistent with the properties of the Protocol Stacks
underlying the Connection on which a given Message is sent. For example,
a Protocol Stack must be able to provide ordering if the <tt>msgOrdered</tt>
Property of a Message is enabled. Sending a Message with Message Properties
inconsistent with the Selection Properties of the Connection yields an error.</t>
          <t>If a Message Property contradicts a Connection Property, and
if this per-Message behavior can be supported, it overrides the Connection
Property for the specific Message. For example, if
<tt>reliability</tt> is set to <tt>Require</tt> and a protocol
with configurable per-Message reliability is used, setting
<tt>msgReliable</tt> to <tt>false</tt> for a particular Message will
allow this Message to be sent without any reliability guarantees. Changing
the <tt>msgReliable</tt> Message Property is only possible for
Connections that were established enabling the Selection Property
<tt>perMsgReliability</tt>. If the contradicting Message Property
cannot be supported by the Connection (such as requiring reliability
on a Connection that uses an unreliable protocol), the <tt>Send</tt> action
will result in a <tt>SendError</tt> event.</t>

        <name>Sending Data</name>
        <t>Once a Connection has been established, it can be used for sending Messages.
By default, <tt>Send</tt> enqueues a complete Message
and takes optional per-Message Properties (see <xref target="send-basic"/>). All <tt>Send</tt> actions
are asynchronous and deliver events (see <xref target="send-events"/>). Sending partial
Messages for streaming large data is also supported (see <xref target="send-partial"/>).</t>
        <t>Messages are sent on a Connection using the <tt>Send</tt> action:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext?, endOfMessage?)
]]></artwork>
        <t>where <tt>messageData</tt> is the data object to send and <tt>messageContext</tt> allows
adding Message Properties, identifying <tt>Send</tt> events related to a specific
Message or inspecting metadata related to the Message sent (see <xref target="msg-ctx"/>).</t>
        <t>The optional <tt>endOfMessage</tt> parameter supports partial sending and is described in
<xref target="send-partial"/>.</t>
        <section anchor="send-basic">
          <name>Basic Sending</name>
          <t>The most basic form of sending on a Connection involves enqueuing a single Data
block as a complete Message with default Message Properties.</t>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
messageData := "hello"
Connection.Send(messageData)
]]></artwork>
          <t>The interpretation of a Message to be sent is dependent on the implementation and
	  on the constraints on the Protocol Stacks implied by the Connection's transport properties. 
For example, a Message could be the payload of
a single datagram for a UDP connection. Another example would be an HTTP Request for an HTTP
Connection.</t>
          <t>Some transport protocols can deliver arbitrarily sized Messages, but other
protocols constrain the maximum Message size. Applications can query the
Connection Property <tt>sendMsgMaxLen</tt> (<xref target="conn-max-msg-send"/>) to determine the maximum size
allowed for a single Message. If a Message is too large to fit in the Maximum Message
Size for the Connection, the <tt>Send</tt> will fail with a <tt>SendError</tt> event (<xref target="send-error"/>). For
example, it is invalid to send a Message over a UDP connection that is larger than
the available datagram sending size.</t>

        <section anchor="send-events">
          <name>Send Events</name>
          <t>Like all actions in the Transport Services API, the <tt>Send</tt> action is asynchronous. There are
several events that can be delivered in response to sending a Message.
Exactly one event (<tt>Sent</tt>, <tt>Expired</tt>, or <tt>SendError</tt>) will be delivered in response
to each call to <tt>Send</tt>.</t>
          <t>Note that, if partial <tt>Send</tt> calls are used (<xref target="send-partial"/>), there will still be exactly
one <tt>Send</tt> event delivered for each call to <tt>Send</tt>. For example, if a Message
expired while two requests to <tt>Send</tt> data for that Message are outstanding,
there will be two <tt>Expired</tt> events delivered.</t>
          <t>The Transport Services API should allow the application to correlate a <tt>Send</tt> event to the particular call to <tt>Send</tt> that triggered the event. The manner in which this correlation is indicated
is implementation specific.</t>

            <t>The <tt>Sent</tt> event occurs when a previous <tt>Send</tt> action has completed, i.e., when
the data derived from the Message has been passed down or through the
underlying Protocol Stack and is no longer the responsibility of
the Transport Services API. The exact disposition of the Message (i.e.,
whether it has actually been transmitted, moved into a buffer on the network
interface, moved into a kernel buffer, and so on) when the <tt>Sent</tt> event occurs
is implementation specific. The <tt>Sent</tt> event contains a reference to the Message
Context of the Message to which it applies.</t>
            <t><tt>Sent</tt> events allow an application to obtain an understanding of the amount
of buffering it creates. That is, if an application calls the <tt>Send</tt> action multiple
times without waiting for a <tt>Sent</tt> event, it has created more buffer inside the
Transport Services System than an application that always waits for the <tt>Sent</tt> event before
calling the next <tt>Send</tt> action.</t>

          <t>Partial Message sending is supported by passing an <tt>endOfMessage</tt> Boolean

        <t>Once a Connection is established, it can be used for receiving data (unless the

sending, the data is received in Messages. Receiving is an asynchronous
operation in which each call to <tt>Receive</tt> enqueues a request to receive new
data from the Connection. Once data has been received, or an error is encountered,
an event will be delivered to complete any pending <tt>Receive</tt> requests (see <xref target="receive-events"/>).
If Messages arrive at the Transport Services System before <tt>Receive</tt> requests are issued,
ensuing <tt>Receive</tt> requests will first operate on these Messages before awaiting any further Messages.</t>
        <section anchor="receiving-action">

          <artwork><![CDATA[
Connection.Receive(minIncompleteLength?, maxLength?)
]]></artwork>
          <t>By default, <tt>Receive</tt> will try to deliver complete Messages in a single event (<xref target="receive-complete"/>).</t>
          <t>The application can set a <tt>minIncompleteLength</tt> value to indicate the smallest partial
Message data size in bytes to be delivered in response to this <tt>Receive</tt>. By default,
this value is Infinite, which means that only complete Messages should be delivered. See Sections&nbsp;<xref target="receive-partial" format="counter"/>
and <xref target="framing" format="counter"/> for more information on how this is accomplished.
If this value is set to some smaller value, the associated <tt>Receive</tt> event will be triggered
	  only:</t>
	  <ol>
	    <li>when at least that many bytes are available,</li>
	    <li>the Message is complete with fewer

it will be as long as <tt>minIncompleteLength</tt> in the case of shorter complete Messages

          <t>The <tt>maxLength</tt> argument indicates the maximum size of a Message in bytes
that the application is currently prepared to receive. The default

minimum of this size and the maximum Message size on receive for
the Connection's Protocol Stack, it will be delivered via <tt>ReceivedPartial</tt>
events (<xref target="receive-partial"/>).</t>
          <t>Note that <tt>maxLength</tt> does not guarantee that the application will receive that many
bytes if they are available; the Transport Services API could return <tt>ReceivedPartial</tt> events with less
data than <tt>maxLength</tt> according to implementation constraints. Note also that <tt>maxLength</tt>

to provide backpressure to the Protocol Stack when it is temporarily not ready to receive Messages.
For example, an application that will later be able to handle multiple <tt>Receive</tt> events at the same time
can make multiple calls to <tt>Receive</tt> without waiting for, or processing, any <tt>Receive</tt> events. An application
that is temporarily unable to process received events for a connection could refrain from calling <tt>Receive</tt>
or could delay calling it. This would lead to a buildup of unread data, which, in turn, could result in
	  backpressure to the sender via a transport protocol's flow control.</t>
	  
          <t>The Transport Services API should allow the application to correlate a <tt>Receive</tt> event to the particular call to <tt>Receive</tt> that triggered the event. The manner in which this correlation is indicated
is implementation specific.</t>

            <t>A <tt>Received</tt> event indicates the delivery of a complete Message.
It contains two objects: the received bytes as <tt>messageData</tt> and the metadata and Properties of the received Message as <tt>messageContext</tt>.</t>
            <t>The <tt>messageData</tt> value provides access to the bytes that were received for this Message, along with the length of the byte array.
The <tt>messageContext</tt> value is provided to enable retrieving metadata about the Message and referring to the Message. The MessageContext object is described in <xref target="msg-ctx"/>.</t>
            <t>See <xref target="framing"/> regarding how to handle Message framing in situations where the Protocol
Stack only provides a byte-stream transport.</t>

]]></artwork>
            <t>If a complete Message cannot be delivered in one event, one part of the Message
can be delivered with a <tt>ReceivedPartial</tt> event. To continue to receive more
of the same Message, the application must invoke <tt>Receive</tt> again.</t>
            <t>Multiple invocations of <tt>ReceivedPartial</tt> deliver data for the same Message by
passing the same MessageContext until the value of the <tt>endOfMessage</tt> Property is delivered or a
 <tt>ReceiveError</tt> occurs. All partial blocks of a single Message are delivered in
order without gaps. This event does not support delivering non-contiguous partial
Messages. For example, if Message A is divided into three pieces (A1, A2, and A3), 
Message B is divided into three pieces (B1, B2, and B3), and <tt>preserveOrder</tt> is not <tt>Require</tt>,
the <tt>ReceivedPartial</tt> could deliver them in a sequence like this: A1, B1, B2, A2, A3, B3.
This is because the MessageContext allows the application to identify the pieces as belonging
	    to Message A and B, respectively. However, a sequence like A1, A3 will never occur.</t>


            <t>If the <tt>minIncompleteLength</tt> in the <tt>Receive</tt> request was set to be Infinite (indicating
a request to receive only complete Messages), the <tt>ReceivedPartial</tt> event could still be
delivered if one of the following conditions is true:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
                <t>the underlying Protocol Stack supports Message boundary preservation and

Message;</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>the underlying Protocol Stack does not support Message boundary

            <t>Note that, in the absence of Message boundary preservation or
a Message Framer, all bytes received on the Connection will be represented as one
large Message of indeterminate length.</t>
            <t>In the following example, an application only wants to receive up to 1000 bytes

	    </ul>
            <t>For example, a <tt>ReceiveError</tt> can
indicate that a Message (identified via the <tt>messageContext</tt> value)
that was being partially received previously, but had not
completed, encountered an error and will not be completed. This can be useful
for an application, which might wish to use this error as a hint to remove

(see <xref target="conn-recv-checksum"/>),
an application can use this error as a hint to inform the peer application

            <t>In contrast, internal protocol reception errors (e.g., loss causing retransmissions

            <t>In some cases, it can be valuable to know whether data was read as part of early
data transfer (before Connection establishment has finished). This is useful if
applications need to treat early data separately,
e.g., if early data has different security Properties than data sent after
Connection establishment. In the case of TLS 1.3, client early data can be replayed
maliciously (see <xref target="RFC8446"/>). Thus, receivers might wish to perform additional
checks for early data to ensure that it is safely replayable. If TLS 1.3 is available
and the recipient Message was sent as part of early data, the corresponding metadata carries
a flag indicating as such. If early data is enabled, applications should check this metadata
field for Messages received during Connection establishment and respond accordingly.</t>

	<li>by the Remote Endpoint (i.e., the remote application calls the <tt>Close</tt>, <tt>CloseGroup</tt>, <tt>Abort</tt>, or <tt>AbortGroup</tt> action), or</li>
	<li>because of an error (e.g., a timeout).</li>
      </ol>
      <t>A local call of the <tt>Close</tt> action will
cause the Connection to send either a <tt>Closed</tt> event or a <tt>ConnectionError</tt> event; a local call of
the <tt>CloseGroup</tt> action will cause all of the Connections in the group to send either a <tt>Closed</tt> event
or a <tt>ConnectionError</tt> event. A local call of the <tt>Abort</tt> action will cause the Connection to send
a <tt>ConnectionError</tt> event, indicating local <tt>Abort</tt> as a <tt>reason</tt>; a local call of the <tt>AbortGroup</tt> action
will cause all of the Connections in the group to send a <tt>ConnectionError</tt> event, indicating local <tt>Abort</tt>
as a <tt>reason</tt>.</t>
      <t>Remote action calls map to events similar to local calls (e.g., a remote <tt>Close</tt> causes the
Connection to send either a <tt>Closed</tt> event or a <tt>ConnectionError</tt> event), but in contrast to local action calls,
it is not guaranteed that such events will indeed be invoked. When an application needs to free resources
associated with a Connection, it ought not rely on the invocation of such events due to
termination calls from the Remote Endpoint; instead, it should use the local termination actions.</t>
      <t><tt>Close</tt> terminates a Connection after satisfying all the requirements that were
specified regarding the delivery of Messages that the application has already
given to the Transport Services System. Upon successfully satisfying all these
requirements, the Connection will send the <tt>Closed</tt> event. For example, if reliable delivery was requested
for a Message handed over before calling <tt>Close</tt>, the <tt>Closed</tt> event will signify
that this Message has indeed been delivered. This action does not affect any other Connection
in the same Connection Group.</t>
      <t>An application <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> assume that it can receive any further data on a Connection
for which it has called <tt>Close</tt>, even if such data is already in flight.</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[

      <t>The <tt>Closed</tt> event informs the application that a <tt>Close</tt> action has successfully
completed or that the Remote Endpoint has closed the Connection.
There is no guarantee that a remote <tt>Close</tt> will be signaled.</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[

      <t><tt>Abort</tt> terminates a Connection without delivering any remaining Messages. This action does
not affect any other Connection that is entangled with this one in a Connection Group.

      <t><tt>CloseGroup</tt> gracefully terminates a Connection and any other Connections in the
same Connection Group. For example, all of the Connections in a
group might be streams of a single session for a multistreaming protocol; closing the entire
group will close the underlying session. See also <xref target="groups"/>. All Connections in the group
will send a <tt>Closed</tt> event when the <tt>CloseGroup</tt> action was successful.

    <section anchor="privacy-security">
      <name>Privacy and Security Considerations</name>
      <t>This document describes a generic API for interacting with a Transport Services System.
Part of this API includes configuration details for transport security protocols, as discussed
in <xref target="security-parameters"/>. It does not recommend use (or disuse) of specific
algorithms or protocols. Any API-compatible transport security protocol ought to work in a Transport Services System.
Security considerations for these protocols are discussed in the respective specifications.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC9621"/> provides general security considerations and requirements for any system that implements the Transport Services Architecture. These include recommendations of relevance to the API, e.g., regarding the use of keying material.</t>
      <t>The described API is used to exchange information between an application and the Transport Services System.  The same authority implementing both systems is not necessarily expected.  However, there is an expectation that the Transport Services Implementation would either:</t>
      <ul>
	<li>be provided as a library that is selected by the application
	from a trusted party or</li>
	<li>be part of the operating system that the application also relies on for
other tasks.</li></ul>
      <t>In either case, the Transport Services API is an internal interface that is used to exchange information locally between two systems.
However, as the Transport Services System is responsible for network communication, it is in the position to
potentially share any information provided by the application with the network or another communication peer.
Most of the information provided over the Transport Services API is useful to configure and select protocols and paths
and is not necessarily privacy sensitive. Still, some information could be privacy sensitive because
it might reveal usage characteristics and habits of the user of an application.</t>
      <t>Of course, any communication over a network reveals usage characteristics, because all
packets, as well as their timing and size, are part of the network-visible wire image <xref target="RFC8546"/>. However,
the selection of a protocol and its configuration also impacts which information is visible, potentially in
clear text, and which other entities can access it. How Transport Services Systems ought to choose protocols -- depending on the security Properties required -- is out of scope for this specification, as it is limited to transport protocols. The choice of a security protocol can be informed by the survey provided in <xref target="RFC8922"/>.</t>
      <t>In most cases, information provided for protocol and path selection
does not directly translate to information that can be observed by network devices on the path.
However, there might be specific configuration
information that is intended for path exposure, e.g., a Diffserv codepoint setting that is either provided
directly by the application or indirectly configured for a traffic profile.</t>
      <t>Applications should be aware that a single communication attempt can lead to more than one connection establishment procedure.  For example,
      this is the case when:</t>
      <ul>
	<li>the Transport Services System also executes name resolution,</li>
	<li>support mechanisms such as
TURN or ICE are used to establish connectivity if protocols or paths are raced or if a path fails and
	fallback or re-establishment is supported in the Transport Services System.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Applications should take special
care when using 0-RTT session resumption (see <xref target="prop-0rtt"/>), as early data sent across multiple paths during
Connection establishment could reveal information that can be used to correlate Endpoints on these paths.</t>
      <t>Applications should also take care to not assume that all data received using the Transport Services API is always
complete or well-formed. Specifically, Messages that are received partially (see <xref target="receive-partial"/>) could be a source
of truncation attacks if applications do not distinguish between partial Messages and complete Messages.</t>
      <t>The Transport Services API explicitly does not require the application to resolve names, though there is
a trade-off between early and late binding of addresses to names. Early binding
allows the Transport Services Implementation to reduce Connection setup latency. This is at the cost
of potentially limited scope for alternate path discovery during Connection
establishment as well as potential additional information leakage about
application interest when used with a resolution method (such as DNS without
TLS) that does not protect query confidentiality.
      Names used with the Transport Services API <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be FQDNs; not providing an FQDN will result in the Transport Services Implementation needing to use DNS search domains for name resolution, which might lead to inconsistent or unpredictable behavior.</t>
      
      <t>These communication activities are not different from what is used at the time of writing. However,
the goal of a Transport Services System is to support
such mechanisms as a generic service within the transport layer. This enables applications to more dynamically
benefit from innovations and new protocols in the transport, although it reduces transparency of the
underlying communication actions to the application itself. The Transport Services API is designed such that protocol and path
selection can be
limited to a small and controlled set if required by the application
to perform a function or to provide security.
Further,
introspection on the Properties of Connection objects allows an application to determine which protocol(s) and path(s) are in use.
A Transport Services System <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a facility logging the communication events of each Connection.</t>

    <section anchor="implmapping">
      <name>Implementation Mapping</name>
      
      <t>The way the concepts from this abstract API map to concrete APIs in a
given language on a given platform largely depends on the features and norms of
the language and the platform.  Actions could be implemented as either functions or method calls. 
For instance, actions could be implemented via event queues, handler
functions or classes, communicating sequential processes, or other
asynchronous calling conventions.</t>
      <section anchor="types">
        <name>Types</name>
        <t>The basic types mentioned in <xref target="notation"/> typically have natural
correspondences in practical programming languages, perhaps constrained by
implementation-specific limitations. For example:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Typically, an Integer can be represented in C by an <tt>int</tt> or <tt>long</tt>; this is subject
to the underlying platform's ranges for each.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>In C, a Tuple may be represented as a <tt>struct</tt> with one member for each of
the value types in the ordered grouping. However, in Python, a Tuple may
be represented as a <tt>tuple</tt>, which is a sequence of dynamically typed
elements.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A Set may be represented as a <tt>std::set</tt> in C++ or as a <tt>set</tt> in
Python. In C, it may be represented as an array or as a higher-level data
structure with appropriate accessors defined.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
	
        <t>The objects described in <xref target="notation"/> can also be represented in
different ways, depending on which programming language is used. Objects
like Preconnections, Connections, and Listeners can be long-lived and 
benefit from using object-oriented constructs. Note that, in C, these
objects may need to provide a way to release or free their underlying
memory when the application is done using them. For example, since a
Preconnection can be used to initiate multiple Connections, it is the
responsibility of the application to clean up the Preconnection memory
if necessary.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="events-and-errors">
        <name>Events and Errors</name>
	
	
        <t>This specification treats events and errors similarly. Errors, just as any
other events, may occur asynchronously in network applications. However,
implementations of this API may report errors synchronously.
This is done according to the error-handling idioms of the implementation
platform, where they can be immediately detected. An example of this is to generate an
exception when attempting to initiate a Connection with inconsistent
Transport Properties. An error can provide an optional <tt>reason</tt> to the
application with further details about why the error occurred.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="time-duration">
        <name>Time Duration</name>
        <t>Time duration types are implementation specific.
For instance, it could be a number of seconds, a number of milliseconds, or a <tt>struct timeval</tt> in C;  in C++, it could be a user-defined <tt>Duration</tt> class.</t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="convenience-functions">
      <name>Convenience Functions</name>
      <section anchor="preference-conv">
        <name>Adding Preference Properties</name>
        <t>TransportProperties will frequently need to set
Selection Properties of type "Preference"; therefore, implementations can provide special actions
for adding each preference level, i.e., <tt>TransportProperties.Set(some_property, avoid)</tt>
is equivalent to <tt>TransportProperties.Avoid(some_property)</tt>:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
TransportProperties.Require(property)
TransportProperties.Prefer(property)
TransportProperties.NoPreference(property)
TransportProperties.Avoid(property)
TransportProperties.Prohibit(property)

      </section>
      <section anchor="property-profiles">
        <name>Transport Property Profiles</name>
        <t>To ease the use of the Transport Services API, implementations
can provide a mechanism to create Transport Property objects (see <xref target="selection-props"/>)
that are preconfigured with frequently used sets of Properties; the following subsections list those that are
	in common use in applications at the time of writing.</t>

      <name>Relationship to the Minimal Set of Transport Services for End Systems</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC8923"/> identifies a minimal set of Transport Services that end systems should offer. These services make all non-security-related transport features of TCP, Multipath TCP (MPTCP), UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP, and Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) available that:</t>
      <ol>
	<li>require interaction with the application and</li>
	<li>do not get in the way of a possible implementation over TCP (or, with limitations, UDP).</li>
      </ol>
      <t>The following text explains how this minimal set is reflected in the present API. For brevity, it is based on the list in  <xref section="4.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8923"/> and updated according to the discussion in <xref section="5" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8923"/>. The present API covers all elements of this section.
This list is a subset of the transport features in
<xref target="RFC8923" sectionFormat="of" section="A"/>, which refers to the primitives in "pass 2".  See <xref target="RFC8303" section="4" sectionFormat="of"/> for 1) further details on the implementation with TCP, MPTCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP, and LEDBAT and 2) how to facilitate finding the specifications for implementing
the services listed below with these protocols.</t>

the <tt>msgLifetime</tt> Message Property implements a time-based way to configure Message reliability (<xref target="msg-lifetime"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>"Ordered message delivery (potentially slower than unordered)" and "Unordered message delivery (potentially faster than ordered)":
these two transport features are controlled via the Message Property <tt>msgOrdered</tt> (<xref target="msg-ordered"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>Request not to delay the acknowledgement (SACK) of a message:
should the protocol support it, this is one of the transport features the Transport Services System can apply when an application uses the <tt>connCapacityProfile</tt> Property (<xref target="prop-cap-profile"/>) or the <tt>msgCapacityProfile</tt> Message Property (<xref target="send-profile"/>) with value <tt>Low Latency/Interactive</tt>.</li>
        
        
          <li>Receive data (with no message delimiting):
<tt>Receive</tt> action (<xref target="receiving-action"/>) and <tt>Received</tt> event (<xref target="receive-complete"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>Receive a message:
<tt>Receive</tt> action (<xref target="receiving-action"/>) and <tt>Received</tt> event (<xref target="receive-complete"/>) using Message Framers (<xref target="framing"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>Information about partial message arrival:
<tt>Receive</tt> action (<xref target="receiving-action"/>) and <tt>ReceivedPartial</tt> event (<xref target="receive-partial"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>Notification of send failures:
<tt>Expired</tt> event (<xref target="expired"/>) and <tt>SendError</tt> event (<xref target="send-error"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>Notification that the stack has no more user data to send:
applications can obtain this information via the <tt>Sent</tt> event (<xref target="sent"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>Notification to a receiver that a partial message delivery has been aborted:
<tt>ReceiveError</tt> event (<xref target="receive-error"/>).</li>
        
        
          <li>Notification of Excessive Retransmissions (early warning below abortion threshold):   
	  <tt>SoftError</tt> event (<xref target="soft-errors"/>).</li>
